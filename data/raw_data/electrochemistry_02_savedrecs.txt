Four novel compounds have been synthesized and characterized, including X-ray crystallographic structures: [Fe-2(mu-Cl-2-bdt)(CO)(5)PPh3] (1), [Fe-2(mu-Cl-2-bdt)(CO)(5)AsPh3] (2), [Fe-2(mu-Cl-2-bdt)(CO)(5)Sb(O)PPh3] (3), and [Fe-2(mu-Cl-2-bdt)(CO)(4)(SbPPh3)(2)] (4). Notably, 3 represents an uncommon hypervalent antimony 12-Sb-5 compound. The three mono-pnictogen compounds (1-3) were produced in yields of 44-58% and have been investigated electrochemically. Evaluation for electrocatalytic formation of dihydrogen in the presence of acetic acid for compounds 1-3 shows negligible advantage over compound A.

Mesoscale modeling in electrochemical devices-A critical perspective	PROGRESS IN ENERGY AND COMBUSTION SCIENCE			English	Review						Electrochemical energy systems; Mesoscale modeling; Porous electrode; Microstructure; Property; Performance	LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES; SMOOTHED PARTICLE HYDRODYNAMICS; LATTICE BOLTZMANN METHOD; EFFECTIVE TRANSPORT-PROPERTIES; DIRECT NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; X-RAY TOMOGRAPHY; PORE-SCALE; REACTIVE TRANSPORT; MORPHOLOGICAL EVOLUTION; GALVANOSTATIC DISCHARGE	Electrochemical energy systems, such as batteries and fuel cells, are being developed for applications ranging from portable devices and electric vehicles to large-scale grid storage. These advanced energy conversion and storage technologies will be a critical aspect of a sustainable energy future and promise to provide cleaner, more efficient energy. Computational modeling at various scales from nanoscale ab initio modeling to macroscale system and controls level modeling, has been a central part of the electrochemical energy research. Much of the complex interactions due to the electrochemistry coupled transport phenomena occur at the interfaces and within the porous electrode microstructures. This is often referred to as the mesoscale and plays a critical role in the operation and efficiency of electrochemical devices. In this critical perspective, we discuss the state-of-the-art, challenges and path forward in mesoscale modeling of electrochemical energy systems and their application to various design and operational issues in solid oxide fuel cells, polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells, lithium ion batteries and metal-air batteries. Particular focus is given to particle-based methods and fine-scale computational fluid dynamics based direct numerical simulation techniques, along with the challenges and advantages of these methods. Notable results from mesoscale modeling are presented along with discussions of the advantages, disadvantages and challenges facing mesoscale model development. This in-depth perspective is envisioned to serve as a primer to the critical role mesoscale modeling is poised to play in advancing the science and engineering of electrochemical energy systems.

Their reactors are of interest for a large community of scientists working in environmental engineering and technology, biochemistry, electrochemistry, physics, mathematical modeling, microbiology and other disciplines. Due to the fascinating fundamentals and the high promises for application at the horizon, the field is increasingly reflected in the curricula of students of the aforementioned disciplines. The main motivation for this article is to give scientists and students an overview on one specific sub-topic: bed electrodes and bed electrode reactors. After a brief introduction, these granulated electrodes are analyzed from an engineering, electrochemical and microbiological point of view. Thereby we guide the potential future operator for deciding which biotechnological processes and applications under which operational conditions (i.e. fixed-bed electrodes versus fluidized bed electrodes) may benefit by using bed electrodes. Special focus is given to the electrochemical and microbial characterization of granules. Thus we discuss a recent tool that opens the possibility to survey the electrochemical behavior of microbial biofilms on bed electrodesthe e-Clamp. Finally, two case studies of bed electrode reactors are briefly discussed.

In this work, we combine conventional optical and crack lithographies to generate single NW devices with controllable and predictable dimensions and placement and with individual electrical contacts to the NWs. We demonstrate NWs made of gold, platinum, palladium, tungsten, tin, and metal oxides. We have used conventional i-line stepper lithography with a nominal resolution of 365 nm to define crack lithography structures in a shadow mask for large-scale manufacturing of sub-20 nm wide NWs, which is a 20-fold improvement over the resolution that is possible with the utilized stepper lithography. Overall, the proposed method represents an effective approach to generate single NW devices with useful applications in electrochemistry, photonics, and gas- and biosensing.

MACROMOLECULES			English	Article							ELECTRON-TRANSFER; CATIONIC-POLYMERIZATION; REDUCTION; MECHANISM; POLYMERS; ATRP; METHACRYLATES; POTENTIALS; CATALYSTS; KINETICS	Electrochemistry provides easily tunable parameters for the preparation of well-defined polymers in a spatiotemporal controlled manner under mild conditions. This work discusses the requisites for an electrochemically mediated reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer (eRAFT) polymerization, in which electrochemical stimuli are used to reduce the RAFT agent, either directly or in the presence of a mediator. The redox properties of several RAFT agents were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and correlated to their structures. The direct electrolysis of RAFT agents in the presence of a monomer caused the loss of RAFT agents, thus leading to uncontrolled polymerizations. These issues could partially be overcome by using a mediator that shuttles the electrons from the electrode to the RAFT agent in solution. Several compounds were tested to define the characteristics of suitable mediators.

It is formed from the reaction of Fe-2(CO)(6)(mu-tdt) (tdt = 3,4-toluenedithiolate) with 1,8-bis(diphenylphosphino)naphthalene (dppn) in presence of Me3NO center dot 2H(2)O affording Fe-2(CO)(4)(kappa(2)-dppn)(mu-tdt) (1) as the major product, together with smaller but reproducible amounts of 2. Both have been characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The electrochemistry of 2 is solvent dependent but in both CH2Cl2 and a 1:1 mixture of CH2Cl2/MeCN it shows a reversible reduction at E-1/2 = -1.54 V and E-1/2 = -1.68 V respectively. While 2 degrades in the presence of the strong acid HBF4 center dot 2H(2)O it is catalytically active for proton-reduction using CF3CO2H. Catalysis occurs at the first reduction potential and it displays an impressive i(cat)/i(P) ratio of 33 after addition of 20 equivalents CF3CO2H. It is amongst the most efficient molecular proton-reduction catalysts reported to date.

Electrochemical measurements on the MnIII/II redox couple show that complex 1 has the largest anodic potential of the set (E-1/2 = 1.16 V vs NHE, Delta E-p = 106 mV) compared to 2 (E-1/2 = 0.95 V, Delta E-p = 108 mV) and 3 (E-1/2 = 0.93 V, Delta E-p = 96 mV). This is due to the fact that 1 has the fewest 5-membered chelate rings and thus is least stabilized. Magnetic studies of 1-3 revealed that all complexes remain high spin throughout the temperature range investigated (2-300 K). X-band EPR investigations in methanol glass indicated that the manganese(II) centers for 2 and 3 resided in a more distorted octahedral geometric configuration compared to 1. To ease spectral interpretation and extract ZFS parameters, we performed high-frequency high-field EPR (HFEPR) at frequencies above 200 GHz and a field of 7.5 T. Simulation of the spectral data yielded g = 2.0013 and D = -0.031 cm(-1) for 1, g = 2.0008, D = -0.0824 cm(-1), vertical bar E/D vertical bar = 0.12 for 2, and g = 2.00028, D = -0.0884 cm(-1) for 3. These results are consistent with 3 possessing the most distorted geometry. Calculations (PBE0/6-31G(d)) were performed on 1-3. Results show that 1 has the largest HOMO-LUMO gap energy (6.37 eV) compared to 2 (6.12 eV) and 3 (6.26 eV). Complex 1 also has the lowest HOMO energies indicating higher stability.

Modeling	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							SOLID-ELECTROLYTE INTERPHASE; LNTERPHASE FORMATION; SURFACE-CHEMISTRY; AGING MECHANISMS; SIMPLE FORMULA; DOUBLE-LAYERS; ION; GRAPHITE; CHARGE; CAPACITY	Mathematical models of capacity fade can reduce the time and cost of lithium-ion battery development and deployment, and growth of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) is a major source of capacity fade. Experiments in Part I reveal nonlinear voltage dependence and strong charge-discharge asymmetry in SEI growth on carbon black negative electrodes, which is not captured by previous models. Here, we present a theoretical model for the electrochemical kinetics of SEI growth coupled to lithium intercalation, which accurately predicts experimental results with few adjustable parameters. The key hypothesis is that the initial SEI is a mixed ionelectron conductor, and its electronic conductivity varies approximately with the square of the local lithium concentration, consistent with hopping conduction of electrons along percolating networks. By including a lithium-ion concentration dependence for the electronic conductivity in the SEI, the bulk SEI thus modulates the overpotential and exchange current of the electrolyte reduction reaction. As a result, SEI growth is promoted during lithiation but suppressed during delithiation. This new insight establishes the fundamental electrochemistry of SEI growth kinetics. Our model improves upon existing models by introducing the effects of electrochemical SEI growth and its dependence on potential, current magnitude, and current direction in predicting capacity fade.

Operando Quantification of (De)Lithiation Behavior of Silicon-Graphite Blended Electrodes for Lithium-Ion Batteries	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						capacity quantification; electrochemistry; graphite; silicon; X-ray diffraction	PERFORMANCE; ANODES; CELLS; INTERCALATION; NANOPARTICLES; CARBONATE; MECHANISM; BINDER; LIFE; XRD	Due to the high lithium capacity of silicon, the composite (blended) electrodes containing silicon (Si) and graphite (Gr) particles are attractive alternatives to the all-Gr electrodes used in conventional lithium-ion batteries. In this Communication, the lithiation and delithiation in the Si and Gr particles in a 15 wt% Si composite electrode is quantified for each component using energy dispersive X-ray diffraction. This quantification is important as the components cycle in different potential regimes, and interpretation of cycling behavior is complicated by the potential hysteresis displayed by Si. The lithiation begins with Li alloying with Si; lithiation of Gr occurs at later stages when the potential dips below 0.2 V (all potentials are given vs Li/Li+). In the 0.2-0.01 V range, the relative lithiation of Si and Gr is approximate to 58% and 42%, respectively. During delithiation, Li+ ion extraction occurs preferentially from Gr in the 0.01-0.23 V range and from Si in the 0.23-1.0 V range; that is, the delithiation current is carried sequentially, first by Gr and then by Si. These trends can be used for rational selection of electrochemical cycling windows that limits volumetric expansion in Si particles, thereby extending cell life.	[Yao, Koffi P.

Discovery of Anion Insertion Electrochemistry in Layered Hydroxide Nanomaterials	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							CAPACITIVE DEIONIZATION; CHARGE STORAGE; BATTERY; COBALT; ELECTRODE; DESALINATION; SUPERCAPACITOR; INTERCALATION; LITHIUM; OXIDE	Electrode materials which undergo anion insertion are a void in the materials innovation landscape and a missing link to energy efficient electrochemical desalination. In recent years layered hydroxides (LHs) have been studied for a range of electrochemical applications, but to date have not been considered as electrode materials for anion insertion electrochemistry. Here, we show reversible anion insertion in a LH for the first time using Co and Co-V layer hydroxides. By pairing in situ synchrotron and quartz crystal microbalance measurements with a computational unified electrochemical band-diagram description, we reveal a previously undescribed anion-insertion mechanism occurring in Co and Co-V LHs. This proof of concept study demonstrates reversible electrochemical anion insertion in LHs without significant material optimization. These results coupled with our foundational understanding of anion insertion electrochemistry establishes LHs as a materials platform for anion insertion electrochemistry with the potential for future application to electrochemical desalination.

Herein, we show that the alkaline HER/HOR kinetics can be unified by the catalytic roles of the adsorbed hydroxyl (OHad)-water-alkali metal cation (AM(+)) adducts, on the basis of the observations that enriching the H-ad abundance via surface Ni benefits the HER/HOR; increasing the AM(+) concentration only promotes the HER, while varying the identity of AM+ affects both HER/HOR. The presence of OHad-(H2O) (H2O)(x)-AM(+) in the double-layer region facilitates the OHad removal into the bulk, forming OH--(H2O)(x)-AM(+) as per the hard-soft acid-base theory, thereby selectively promoting the HER. It can be detrimental to the HOR as per the bifunctional mechanism, as the AM(+) destabilizes the OHad, which is further supported by the CO oxidation results. This new notion may be important for alkaline electrochemistry.	[Liu, Ershuai; Li, Jingkun; Huong Thi Thanh Doan; Abraham, K.

The electro-deoxygenation (EDO) cell achieves O-2 removal by leveraging the high overpotential of oxygen evolution on activated carbon and its propensity to oxidize under anodic polarization in aqueous solution: oxygen is reduced at the cathode while water is oxidized and incorporated into surface oxide functional groups at the anode, effectively sequestering dissolved oxygen. Polarized electrodes promote the two-step reduction of DO resulting in some residual hydrogen peroxide in the effluent, which may be beneficial for certain applications. A subsequent cell is modified with Ni cathodes downstream to reduce all H2O2 to water for particularly sensitive applications; in this cell >99% of incoming DO could be removed to lower than 10 ppb. EDO cells, which currently employ sacrificial anodes, can deaerate 30 L g(anode)(-1) of water at an energy consumption of 1 kWh per 10,000 L; carbon anode replacement can recharge the cell. The technique is versatile, inexpensive, and environmentally friendly, deoxygenating solutions from dilute to seawater concentrations at flow rates beyond 50 ml min(-1) (O-2 flux = 10(-4) mol s(-1) m(-2)), more than 50x faster DO removal than similar technologies.

J	Alemayehu, AB; McCormick, LJ; Vazquez-Lima, H; Ghosh, A				Alemayehu, Abraham B.; McCormick, Laura J.; Vazquez-Lima, Hugo; Ghosh, Abhik			Relativistic Effects on a Metal-Metal Bond: Osmium Corrole Dimers	INORGANIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article							NEAR-IR PHOSPHORESCENCE; BINUCLEAR COMPLEXES; RUTHENIUM CORROLES; PERIODIC TRENDS; MOLYBDENUM; SPECTROSCOPY; TUNGSTEN; CHROMIUM; SPECTRA; ELECTROCHEMISTRY	A series of metal-metal bonded osmium corrole dimers, {Os[TpXPC]}(2), were synthesized in reasonably good yields (35-46%) via the interaction of the corresponding free-base meso-tris(p-X-phenyl)corroles (H-3[TpXPC], X = CF3, H, CH3, and OCH3), Os-3(CO)(12), and potassium carbonate in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene under an inert atmosphere at 180 degrees C over several hours. The complexes are only the second class of Os corroles reported to date (the first being (OsN)-N-VI corroles) and also the second class of metal-metal bonded metallocorrole dimers (the other being Ru corrole dimers). Comparison of the X-ray structures, redox potentials, and optical spectra of analogous Ru and Os corrole dimers, along with scalar-relativistic DFT calculations, has provided an experimentally calibrated account of relativistic effects in these complexes. Three of the Os corrole dimers (X = CF3, H, and OCH3) were analyzed with single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, revealing inversion-related corrole rings with eclipsed Os-N bonds and Os-Os distances of similar to 2.24 angstrom that are similar to 0.06 angstrom longer than the Ru-Ru distances in the analogous Ru corrole dimers. Interestingly, a comparison of scalar-relativistic and nonrelativistic DFT calculations indicates that this difference in metal-metal bond distance does not, in fact, reflect a differential relativistic effect. For a given corrole ligand, the Ru and Os corrole dimers exhibit nearly identical oxidation potentials but dramatically different reduction potentials, with the Os values similar to 0.5 V lower relative to Ru, suggesting that whereas oxidation occurs in a ligand-centered manner, reduction is substantially metal-centered, which indeed was confirmed by scalar-relativistic calculations. The calculations further indicate that approximately a third of the similar to 0.5 V difference in reduction potentials can be ascribed to relativity. The somewhat muted value of this relativistic effect appears to be related to the finding that reduction of an Os corrole dimer is not exclusively metal-based but that a significant amount of spin density is delocalized over to the corrole ligand; in contrast, reduction of an Ru corrole dimer occurs exclusively on the Ru-Ru linkage. For isoelectronic complexes, the Ru and Os corrole dimers exhibit substantially different UV-vis spectra. A key difference is a strong near-UV feature of the Os series, which in energy terms is blue-shifted by similar to 0.55 V relative to the analogous feature of the Ru series. TDDFT calculations suggest that this difference may be related to higher-energy Os(5d)-based LUMOs in the Os case relative to analogous MOs for Ru.

Electrochemical behavior of a gold nanoring electrode microfabricated on a silicon micropillar	SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL			English	Article						Nanoelectrode; Nanoring; Micropillar; Electrochemistry; Interface; Dopamine	SINGLE-CELL ANALYSIS; IMPEDANCE SPECTROSCOPY; NANOELECTRODE ARRAYS; FARADAIC ELECTROCHEMISTRY; VESICULAR EXOCYTOSIS; RECESSED ELECTRODES; FABRICATION; NANOPILLARS; SENSITIVITY; PERFORMANCE	We report on the microfabrication and characterization of a gold nanoring electrode (Au NRE) patterned on top of a silicon (Si) micropillar. An NRE of 165 +/- 10 nm in width was micropatterned on 4.6 +/- 1 mu m diameter x 17.5 +/- 2.5 mu m long Si micropillar with an intervening 50 nm thick hafnium oxide insulating layer. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy data confirmed excellent cylindricality of the micropillar with vertical sidewalls and a completely intact layer of Au NRE encompassing the entire micropillar perimeter. The electrochemical behavior of the Au NRE was characterized by a steady-state cyclic voltammo-gram with extremely high signal-to-noise ratios of 2500 and charging currents as small as 1.5 +/- 0.3 pA. A " semicircle spectrum" from the Nyquist plot indicates a kinetically-controlled voltammetric current response, which is unique to nanoscale electrodes. The variations in the exchange current values, which are dependent on the NRE area and standard rate constant, place a greater emphasis on the isotropic gold wet etching process that defined the geometry of the Au NRE. Circuit fitting of the electrochemical impedance spectra suggests that the NRE geometry can be varied from inlaid to nanotrench with depths controllable by the etching process. This resulted in differing stead-state voltammetric currents and interfacial properties in terms of charge transfer resistance, constant phase element and trench resistance values. The applicability of Au NREs to electrochemical sensing is demonstrated by detecting lead, a neurotoxin at 100 ppb levels. Also, by surface-modification with multi-walled carbon nanotubes, dopamine, a neurochemical implicated in various brain disorders, is detected at a sensitivity as low as 100 nM with 1000-fold selectivity versus common interferents. The flexibility of the microfabrication approach allows for the creation of multiple NREs of controllable width and nanometer spacing on a single micropillar. This capability and in particular where the NRE is micropatterned on three-dimensional microstructures as will be reported herein, facilitates unique electroanalytical capabilities such as intracellular electrochemistry and highly multiplexed detection for emerging biological applications.

J	Gupta, S; Dimakis, N				Gupta, Sanju; Dimakis, Nicholas			Computational predictions of electronic properties of graphene with defects, adsorbed transition metal-oxides and water using density functional theory	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Density functional theory; Graphene; Transition metal oxide adsorption; Defects; Hydration; Overlap population/charge transfer	BASIS-SETS; ADSORPTION; CO; SUPERCAPACITOR; NANOSHEETS; SILICENE; ENERGY	The interfacial interactions between transition metal oxides (vanadium oxide VO2, vanadium pentoxide V2O5, cobalt oxide CoO and Co3O4, manganese oxide MnO2) and water adsorbates on graphene supports as solvated interfaces and influence of defects in graphene are studied using periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations in view of their significance for applied electrochemistry. DFT complemented and synergized our experimental work. The optimized metal oxide adatom-graphene geometries identified the preferred adatom sites, whereas metal oxide-graphene strengths are correlated with the adatom distance from the graphene plane, the Metal-C overlap populations, and the adsorption energies. The presence of finite electronic density of states (DOS) near Fermi level and charge transfers between the adatom top layer and graphene supports reflect primarily covalent bonding nature. The presence of small orbital overlap integral of bonds between the s and p (and d) orbitals of the nearest carbon (graphene), carbon oxide (graphene oxide) and metal oxide atoms reveal localized orbital re-hybridization resulting in changes in DOS yielding high electrochemical activity. Moreover, for increased adatom coverage the extent of charge transfer reverses resulting in limited electroactivity. In fact, DFT calculations are corroborated with experimental findings, where graphene-based supports decorated with optimal mass loaded nanostructured Co3O4 and MnO2 (as well as V2O5) were capable of delivering maximum specific energy storage capacity (Cs) > 550 F.g(-1) (Gupta et al.

The presence of defects in graphene materials results in new electronic states to endow unique functionalities that is not otherwise possible in the bulk and with adsorbed water molecules besides optimum C/O ratio in graphene oxide nanosheets that show redshift thus a decreasing bandgap and finite charge transfer from graphene to water molecules. The case examples studied in this work represent a first glimpse of what may become routine and integral step in materials design and discovery for alternative energy and sustainable environmental technologies.

Structural Evolution of Metal (Oxy)hydroxide Nanosheets during the Oxygen Evolution Reaction	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						electrochemical atomic force microscopy; electrocatalysis; (oxy)hydroxide nanosheets	WATER OXIDATION; PHOTOANODES; ELECTROCATALYSTS; EFFICIENT; TRENDS	Metal (oxy)hydroxides (MOxHy, M = Fe, Co, Ni, and mixtures thereof) are important materials in electrochemistry. In particular, MOxHy are the fastest known catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. While key descriptors such as overpotentials and activity have been thoroughly characterized, the nanostructure and its dynamics under electrochemical conditions are not yet fully understood. Here, we report on the structural evolution of Ni1-delta Co delta OxHy nanosheets with varying ratios of Ni to Co, in operando using atomic force microscopy during electrochemical cycling. We found that the addition of Co to NiOxHy nanosheets results in a higher porosity of the as synthesized nanosheets, apparently reducing mechanical stress associated with redox cycling and hence enhancing stability under electrochemical conditions. As opposed to nanosheets composed of pure NiOxHy, which dramatically reorganize under electro-chemical conditions to form nanoparticle assemblies, restructuring is not found for Ni1-delta Co delta OxHy with a high Co content. Ni0.8Fe0.2OxHy nanosheets show high roughness as synthesized which increases during electrochemical cycling while the integrity of the nanosheet shape is maintained. These findings enhance the fundamental understanding of MOxHy materials and provide insight into how nanostructure and composition affect structural dynamics at the nanoscale.

By utilizing a condensation reaction, ethylene groups are inserted between six linear sulfurs in a chain to obtain PEHS while simultaneously exercising control over the polysulfur chain length. Additionally, by selecting a low-molecular weight organic group, PENS contains 87 wt % sulfur, thus maximizing the material-level specific capacity to 1217 mA h g(-1). Furthermore, this synthesis method is validated using a host of materials characterization techniques. In a battery, PEHS prevents the formation of soluble long-chain intermediates that plague traditional sulfur cathodes. This enables a high material-level capacity of 774 mA h g(-1) at 1C-rate alongside a stable performance over 350 cycles with a capacity fade rate of only 0.083% per cycle. We also elucidate the unique reaction pathway of our short-chain polysulfur material and provide a useful foundation for further development of sulfur-containing polymer-based cathode materials.

However, it is a challenge to synthesize such ADMS-decorated carbon networks. Here, an innovative fusion-foaming methodology is presented in which energetic metal-organic framework (EMOF) nanoparticles are puffed up to submillimeter-scaled ADMS-decorated carbon networks via a one-step pyrolysis. Their extraordinary catalytic performance towards oxygen reduction reaction verifies the practicability of this synthetic approach. Moreover, this approach can be readily applicable to a wide range of unexplored EMOFs, expanding scopes for future materials design.

We show that the molecules are co-encapsulated within an amphiphilic block copolymer shell by observing distinct ultrafast dynamics in the binary nanoparticles compared to nanoparticles of their individual components, which we rationalize as a photoinduced charge transfer. We then draw similarities between the charge transfer dynamics studied in our system and the charge dissociation process in macroscale organic bulk heterojunction blends for OPV applications by assigning the ultrafast time component (approximate to 10 ps) to direct interfacial charge transfer and the slow component (70-200 ps) to diffusion limited charge transfer. This discovery can inspire the development of mixed-composition nanoparticles with new functionality for optoelectronic and theranostic applications.

First, we determined electrochemically the energy levels of dispersions of perovskite QDs with different band gaps induced by the different ratios between halides (Br and I) and metallic cations (Pb and Sn). Then, we selected CsPbBr3 QDs to demonstrate the photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical oxidation of MBT, confirming that hole injection takes place from CsPbBr3 QDs to MBT, resulting in the total degradation of MBT as evidenced by electrospray mass spectrometry analyses. Although the stability and toxicity of these QDs are major issues to address in the near future, the results obtained in the present study open promising perspectives for the implementation of solar-driven catalytic strategies based on these fascinating materials.

The square planar S = 1/2 Fe-I(P4N2)(+) cation (FeI+) reversibly binds H-2/D-2 in solution, exhibiting an inverse equilibrium isotope effect of K-H2/K-D2 = 0.58(4) at -5.0 degrees C. In the presence of excess H-2, the dihydrogen complex Fe-I(H-2)(+) cleaves H-2 at 25 degrees C in a net hydrogen atom transfer reaction, producing the dihydrogen-hydride trans-Fe-II(H)(H-2)(+). The proposed mechanism of H-2 splitting involves both intra- and intermolecular steps, resulting in a mixed first- and second-order rate law with respect to initial [FeI+]. The key intermediate is a paramagnetic dihydride complex, trans-Fe-III(H)(2+), whose weak Fe-III-H bond dissociation free energy (calculated BDFE = 44 kcal/mol) leads to bimetallic H-H homolysis, generating trans-Fe-II(H)(H-2)(+).

Surface Attachment Enhances the Thermodynamic Stability of ProteinL	ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION			English	Article						biophysics; electrochemistry; protein engineering; proteins; thermodynamics	BINDING DOMAIN; FREE-ENERGY; PERFORMANCE; ADSORPTION; CHAIN	Despite the importance of protein-surface interactions in both biology and biotechnology, our understanding of their origins is limited due to a paucity of experimental studies of the thermodynamics behind such interactions. In response, we have characterized the extent to which interaction with a chemically well-defined macroscopic surface alters the stability of proteinL. To do so, we site-specifically attached a redox-reporter-modified protein variant to a hydroxy-terminated monolayer on a gold surface and then used electrochemistry to monitor its guanidine denaturation and determine its folding free energy. Comparison with the free energy seen in solution indicates that interaction with this surface stabilizes the protein by 6kJmol(-1), a value that is in good agreement with theoretical estimates of the entropic consequences of surface-induced excluded volume effects, thus suggesting that chemically specific interactions with this surface (e.g., electrostatic interactions) are limited in magnitude.

Herein, we report an electrochemically deposited mixed Cu-Co-P film, as a bifunctional catalyst with high stability and activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER, in 1 M KOH). In alkaline medium, the Cu-Co-P catalyst outperforms the state-of-art catalysts for both HER (Pt) and OER (RuO2) and is stable under continuous electrolysis for up to 72 hours. Using Cu-Co-P electrodes as both the anode and the cathode increases the activity by similar to 2.5 times greater than the integrated performance of RuO2 (anode) and Pt (cathode) at 1.9 V. The competent bifunctionality of Cu-Co-P is facilitated by Cu incorporation, leading to a low surface passivation of the electrode. This study offers a new strategy to develop earth abundant bimetallic phosphides, which are potential catalysts for many alternative energy technologies.

Thermodynamics and Electron Transfer Kinetics of the [CeCl6](2-/3-) Redox Reaction in a Series of Bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide-Based Room Temperature Ionic Liquids	ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING			English	Article						Hexachlorocerate; Homogeneous and heterogeneous kinetics; Capacitance	DIFFERENTIAL CAPACITANCE; ELECTROCHEMICAL-BEHAVIOR; SOLUTION VISCOSITY; IRON COMPLEXES; GLASSY-CARBON; MARCUS-THEORY; DOUBLE-LAYER; CHLORIDE; LANTHANIDE; OXIDATION	Cerium(IV) is often employed as a surrogate for plutonium(IV) in investigations involving the processing of spent nuclear fuel and is an important oxidant in organic synthetic reactions. Surprisingly little is known about the chemistry and electrochemistry of cerium(IV) complexed as [CeCl6](2-) in the hydrophobic green ionic liquids that are proposed for these applications such as those based on the bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Tf2N-) anion. Of particular interest is its stability in these ionic liquids in the presence of unbound Cl-. Therefore, the homogeneous pseudo-first-order kinetics of the reaction between [CeCl6](2-) and Cl- was investigated in the 1-(1-butyl)-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (BuMePyroTf(2)N) ionic liquid as a function of temperature. These measurements revealed that [CeCl6](2-) is surprisingly stable, even at elevated temperatures with a half-life of 44 min at 398 K. Although classed as an outer sphere electron transfer process, the [CeCl6](2-/3-) redox reaction exhibits mixed control in this ionic liquid. In order to elucidate the origin of this behavior, detailed measurements of the heterogeneous rate of this reaction were carried out in BuMePyroTf(2)N and in five additional ionic liquids based on the Tf2N- anion with structurally and chemically distinct cations, including 1-(1-butyl)-3-methylimidazolium (BuMeIm(+)), tri(1-butyl)methylammonium (Bu3MeN+), 1-butyltrimethylammonium (BuMe3N+), 1-(1-butyl)pyridinium (BuPy+), and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium (EtMeIm(+)) by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The heterogeneous rate constants of the [CeCl6](2-/3-) reaction at a glassy carbon electrode were found to exhibit a near linear dependence on the absolute viscosity of these ionic liquids, indicating that the rate of this reaction may be controlled by solvent reorganization dynamics in these highly viscous ionic liquids in accordance with contemporary predictions of the Marcus theory of electron transfer. Furthermore, the choice of the organic cation can be used to tune the redox potential of the [CeCl6](2-/3-) electrode reaction.

Detection methods based on electrochemistry or on localized surface plasmon responses have advanced through using nanostructured electrodes prepared by electrodeposition, which is capable of preparing a wide range of different structures. Supported nanoparticles can be prepared by electrodeposition through applying fixed potentials, cycling potentials, and fixed current methods. Nanoparticle sizes, shapes, and surface densities can be controlled, and regular structures can be prepared by electrodeposition through templates. The incorporation of multiple nanomaterials into composite films can take advantage of the superior and potentially synergistic properties of each component. Nanostructured electrodes can provide supports for enzymes, antibodies, or oligonucleotides for creating sensors against many targets in areas such as genomic analysis, the detection of protein antigens, or the detection of small molecule metabolites. Detection can also be performed using electrochemical methods, and the nanostructured electrodes can greatly enhance electrochemical responses by carefully designed schemes. Biosensors based on electrodeposited nanostructures can contribute to the advancement of many goals in bioanalytical and clinical chemistry.

Specifically, the flavonoids in tea, such as catechin and epigallocatechin gallate, have been shown to have positive health effects. These compounds are also oxidizable, so the concentrations of these compounds in a given kind of tea can be determined using cyclic voltammetry. Green, black, oolong, and herbal teas were each diluted using pH 7.0 phosphate buffer, analyzed using cyclic voltammetry, and compared to the standards of epigallocatechin gallate, catechin hydrate, and catechol. The effect of brewing temperature on the concentration of catechins was also examined. Students learned about the common flavonoids in tea and the effect of brewing temperature on the concentration of catechins in solution.

Dialkyl dithiophosphinates are a technologically and commercially important class of collectors used in the flotation processing of Cu-Au, complex polymetallic, and precious metal ores. Plant usage has demonstrated that dithiophosphinates exhibit higher selectivity and flotation rates for Cu sulfides, galena, and precious metal values in the presence of other gangue sulfides, than the traditionally used collectors such as dialkyl dithiophosphates and xanthates. They also have an attractive health, safety, and environmental (HSE) profile. Although dithiophosphinates received little attention in the past in the flotation research community, recently, there has been significant interest in this chemistry, and numerous studies have been conducted to understand the fundamental interactions of dithiophosphinates with several base metal sulfides and precious metals. A critical overview of fundamental studies, laboratory ore flotation, and plant practice of dithiophosphinates is given in this paper. The findings from these studies are rationalized and explained by drawing on concepts and insights from coordination chemistry. A comparison between the interactions with various minerals and metals of dithiophosphinate and dithiophosphate analogues brings out some of the subtleties that seemingly minor changes in collector chemistry can make. The critical overview and analysis given here is useful in identifying gaps in knowledge regarding this important class of compounds. This in turn can provide a basis for the design of studies to advance our understanding of dithiophosphinate flotation performance.	[Tercero, Napoleon; Nagaraj, D.

The EDL structure generally refers to the inhomogeneous distribution of solution ions at the interfacial region. Dynamic changes in the EDL structure due to the transport of charges at the nanometer scale are the physicochemical origin of recently resolved novel nanotransport phenomena. High surface area materials and devices are potentially advantageous for better applications by providing more accessible interfaces. It is of high importance to emphasize that interfacial structures are indications of capacity, while the efficiency is often related to dynamics. This review discusses emerging transport phenomena under steady-state conditions and the transient deviations in prototype channel-type nanopores as unit elements for porous electrodes/membranes. The fundamental governing mechanism and structure-function correlations will be discussed in the context of energy harvesting and storage, desalination and phase transition, and resistive pulse sensing at the nanometer scale toward single-event/entity resolutions.

Anodic stripping electrochemical analysis of metal nanoparticles	CURRENT OPINION IN ELECTROCHEMISTRY			English	Review						Nanoparticles; Metal; Oxidation; Stripping; Electrochemistry; Impacts; Collisions; Analysis	SILVER NANOPARTICLES; GOLD NANOPARTICLES; IMPACT ELECTROCHEMISTRY; ELECTROOXIDATION THEORY; NICKEL NANOPARTICLES; SURFACE COVERAGE; AU NANOPARTICLES; TRACE-METALS; SIZE; OXIDATION	Traditional anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) involves electrodeposition (reduction) of metal ions from solution over some time scale onto a working electrode followed by stripping (oxidation) of the deposited metal in a second step, where the stripping potential and quantity of charge passed provide information about the metal identity and solution concentration, respectively. ASV has recently been extended to the analysis of metal nanoparticles (NPs), which have grown popular because of their fascinating properties tunable by size, shape, and composition. There is a need for improved methods of NP analysis, and because metal NPs can be oxidized to metal ions, ASV is a logical choice. Early studies involved metal NPs as tags for the detection of biomolecules. More recently, anodic stripping has been used to directly analyze the physical, chemical, and structural properties of metal NPs. This review highlights the stripping analysis of NP assemblies on macroelectrodes, individual NPs in solution during collisions with a microelectrode, and a single NP attached to an electrode. A surprising amount of information can be learned from this very simple, low-cost technique.

The photocatalytic processes, such as the oxidation of methanol and iodide, that result from the electron-hole pair formed within a nanoparticle (NP) allow the detection of discrete current transient events assigned to single entities. Photocatalytic current amplification allows detection of collisions between the semiconductor NPs and the ultramicroelectrode that produce current transient. Staircase responses and blips in the i vs. t response indicate that irreversible and reversible NP/electrode interactions result depending on the experimental conditions. Dye sensitization increases the photocurrent magnitude of ZnO and TiO2 with respect to bare TiO2 NPs. The microelectrodes used are Pt, TiO2/Pt, TiO2/Au, and F-doped SnO2.

Graphene materials obtained from these reductions processes were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and cyclic voltammetry (CV). Each obtained material displayed different properties, mainly due to the efficiency of each reductant to eliminate oxygen moieties from graphene oxide. Defects and turbostratic structures where generated by the oxidation, exfoliation and reduction processes. Characterization of the structural defects in each material was done with different techniques and correlated with cyclic voltammetry an interfacial technique. Electrochemical parameters of the reduced graphene oxides and their precursor were characterized by means of the redox behavior of potassium hexacyanoferrate(II) trihydrate, an outer-sphere electrochemical probe. Overall, a general methodology to correlate the surface chemistry of graphenoids with the physical characterization is presented.

Specifically, metal nanoparticle catalysts down to sizes of 4 and even 1 (single atom catalysts) on graphene have been studied for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR). A recent study showed that 4-atom transition metal intermetallic nanoparticles (NP) on graphene (metal-decorated graphene (MDG)) even generate a predictive Volcano Plot for ORR activity. Initial results from that study were not completely explained, and an expanded analysis and discussion built from that work is presented in this manuscript. Specifically, in this new work, the original Volcano Plot for 4-atom MDG NP catalysts for the ORR is analyzed for its counter-intuitive thermodynamic inversion between the rate limiting steps of O* hydrogenation and OH* hydrogenation. The Volcano Plot is then further studied for dependence on solvent correction energy, system pH, and with an initial probe on the sensitivity of descriptor values on doping of the graphene support via B and N atoms. Recommendations for optimum 4-atom MDG NP catalyst operation for the ORR are provided, and directions for future work and study are provided.

Suppression of Electrochemically Driven Phase Transitions in Nanostructured MoS2 Pseudocapacitors Probed Using Operando X-ray Diffraction	ACS NANO			English	Article						MoS2; phase transition suppression; pseudocapacitance; intercalation pseudocapacitor; fast charging; nanocrystal assemblies; porous electrodes	LITHIUM INTERCALATION; ATOMIC MECHANISM; LI-INTERCALATION; ENERGY-STORAGE; NANOSHEETS; TRANSFORMATION; DYNAMICS; SIZE; CRYSTALLITES; EVOLUTION	Pseudocapacitors with nondiffusion-limited charge storage mechanisms allow for fast kinetics that exceed conventional battery materials. It has been demonstrated that nanostructuring conventional battery materials can induce pseudocapacitive behavior. In our previous study, we found that assemblies of metallic 1T MoS2 nanocrystals show faster charge storage compared to the bulk material. Quantitative electrochemistry demonstrated that the current response is capacitive. In this work, we perform a series of operando X-ray diffraction studies upon electrochemical cycling to show that the high capacitive response of metallic 1T MoS2 nanocrystals is due to suppression of the standard first-order phase transition. In bulk MoS2, a phase transition between 1T and triclinic phases (LixMoS2) is observed during lithiation and delithiation in both the galvanostatic traces (as distinctive plateaus) and the X-ray diffraction patterns with the appearance of the additional peaks. MoS2 nanocrystal assemblies, on the other hand, show none of these features. We hypothesize that the reduced MoS2 crystallite size suppresses the first-order phase transition and gives rise to solid solution-like behavior, potentially due to the unfavorable formation of nucleation sites in confined spaces. Overall, we find that nanostructuring MoS2 suppresses the 1T-triclinic phase transition and shortens Li-ion diffusion path lengths, allowing MoS2 nanocrystal assemblies to behave as nearly ideal pseudocapacitors.

Wide range of energy storage devices, Redox-flow batteries (RFB), Lithium ion based batteries (LIB), and Lithium-sulfur (LSB) batteries are being developed for various applications ranging from grid scale level storage to mobile electronics. Material complexities associated with these energy storage devices with unique electrochemistry are formidable challenge which needs to be address for transformative progress in this field. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) - a powerful surface analysis tool - has been widely used to study these energy storage materials because of its ability to identify, quantify and image the chemical distribution of redox active species. However, accessing the deeply buried solid-electrolyte interfaces (which dictates the performance of energy storage devices) has been a challenge in XPS usage. Herein we report our recent efforts to utilize the XPS to gain deep insight about these interfaces under realistic conditions with varying electrochemistry involving RFB, LIB and LSB.

This has been assessed by various techniques (FTIR, TGA, UV-Visible, XPS, elemental analysis, single crystal X-ray and electrochemistry). Single-crystal X-ray analyses showed that, in the solid state, 1 forms a 2-D network in which [H2W12O42](10-) fragments are linked in pairs via Mn2+ ions, leading to linear chains of the form [(Mn(H2O)(3))(2)(H2W12O42)](n)(6n-). The connection between chains occurs also via Mn2+ ions which bind [H2W12O42](10-) fragments belonging to two adjacent chains, forming an infinite 2-D network. A complete electrochemical study was done in aqueous solution where 1 is stable in the pH range 1 to 6. This complex undergoes multiple electron-transfer processes that lead to the electro-generation of manganese high oxidation state species that catalyse water electro-oxidation. 1 is also effective in the electro-catalytic reduction of nitrite and dioxygen.

However, these gains have come at a cost of fast capacity fade and poor rate performace. In our previous study, we showed that Al2O3 ALD coatings on LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) and LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 (NCA) cathodes prevented surface phase transitions, reduced impedance, and extended cycle life in high voltage cells. Here, neutron diffraction (ND), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) are used to fully investigate the mechanism by which ALD surface coatings mitigate NMC811 cathode degredation. Refinement of ND patterns indicated no changes in the bulk crystal structure of cycled cathodes-with or without the Al2O3 coating. Rather, the improved performance of ALD-coated cathodes is clearly due to surface stabilization. EELS established that all three transition metal oxidation states were reduced at the surface of the uncoated cathode after cycling, whereas the coated cathode showed no changes in surface oxidation states relative to the bulk. The surface coatings also prevented transition metal dissolution and crossover. XPS analysis of the anode harvested from cycled cells with uncoated cathodes showed significant amounts of Mn deposited within the SEI. In contrast, no Mn could be detected on the anodes cycled with coated cathodes. These results affirm that ALD coatings can effectively reduce the reactivity of the NMC surface and prevent detrimental side reactions that shorten battery cycle life.

The objective is to investigate the effect of Ni mole fraction and the aerosol preheating and flame synthesis temperatures on the particle properties and electrochemistry by comparing NCM811 with LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2 (NCM111). It is found that the solution composition strongly influences precursor precipitation and oxidation and the resultant particle morphology. NCM111 solutions form predominantly spherical particles from single droplets, whereas Ni-rich solutions form irregularly shaped particles because the lower solubility of Ni nitrate and its high concentration causes rapid precipitation at the droplet surface and subsequent formation and collapse of shell-like structures in the flame. After annealing, NCM111 retains the secondary particle structure, but NCM811 forms irregular shapes with a broad size distribution of primary features because the higher decomposition temperature of NCM811 precursor solutions limits the oxidation and particle formation in the aerosol phase. It is also found that aerosol preheating and flame temperatures play critical roles in determining the electrochemical properties of the final annealed product. The best NCM811 cycling performance was achieved using higher aerosol preheating temperatures (450 K) and lower synthesis temperatures (1350 K). These conditions promote single-mode solid particle formation which increases the size-of the primary particles and enhances the uniformity of the primary particle size distribution, thereby improving structural stability without using high synthesis temperatures that damage the ordering of the layered crystal structure.

Electrochemical Aptamer-Based Sensor for Real-Time Monitoring of Insulin	ACS SENSORS			English	Article						insulin; aptamers; sensors; G-quadruplex; electrochemistry	GRAPHENE; BIOSENSOR; ARCHITECTURE; REAGENTLESS; STABILITY; SELECTION; PROBE	In this paper, we developed an electrochemical, aptamer-based (E-AB) for the real-time monitoring of insulin. The sensor utilizes a redox label-modified guanine-rich aptamer which folds into a G-quadruplex for specific recognition of insulin. To develop a reproducible E-AB sensor employing insulin aptamer probes for the detection of insulin, 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) pretreatment is crucial as it disrupts interstrand G-quartets. After sensor pretreatment with 10% SDS, a more uniform sensor response is obtained. Upon introduction of the insulin target, binding-induced steric hindrance quantitatively reduces the efficiency of electron transfer of a distal-end redox label leading to the rapid signal change within similar to 60 s. Testing demonstrates that the E-AB insulin exhibits a limit of detection of 20 nM and can be used to discriminate against both glucagon and somatostatin in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer, typically used in perfusion experiments. These results demonstrate that this assay has potential for rapid, specific, and quantitative analysis of insulin.

Here, the development of a vapor cavity generating ultrasonic platform for nebulizing liquid metal within aqueous media for the one-step production of stable and functional liquid metal NPs is shown. The size distribution of the NPs is fully characterized and it is demonstrated that various macro and small molecules can also be grafted onto these liquid metal NPs during the liquid-based nebulization process. The cytotoxicity of the NPs grafted with different molecules is further explored. Moreover, it is shown that it is possible to control the thickness of the oxide layer on the produced NPs using electrochemistry that can be embedded within the platform. It is envisaged that this platform can be adapted as a cost-effective and versatile device for the rapid production of functional liquid metal NPs for future liquid metal-based optical, electronic, catalytic, and biomedical applications.

At 300 nm spatial resolution and 200 ms temporal resolution, we reveal rapid electrochemical oxidation of graphene, as well as its efficient electrochemical reduction back to the unoxidized state. We identify 1.4 V (vs Ag/AgCl) as the onset voltage for oxidation and show that the process is driven by free radicals generated in the electrolysis of water and so fully suppressible by a radical-trapping molecule. Moreover, we find the oxidation process to be spatially heterogeneous at the nanoscale, defect- and history-dependent, and characterized by a self-limiting effect unique to the two-dimensional system. We further demonstrate that electrochemical reduction rapidly reverses the oxidized graphene back to the unoxidized state in a controlled manner and find strong dependency of reduction speed on the reduction voltage and pH, from which we conclude a one-to-one relationship between protons and electrons in the reduction process. Besides elucidating the electrochemical reaction mechanisms of graphene, our results point to new pathways to the controlled generation and fine-tuning of graphene derivatives through electrochemistry.

To achieve plasmonic photocatalysis, the hot charge carriers created when light is absorbed must be harnessed before they decay through internal relaxation pathways. We demonstrate the role of photogenerated hot holes in the oxidative dissolution of individual gold nanorods with millisecond time resolution while tuning charge-carrier density and photon energy using snapshot hyperspectral imaging. We show that light-induced hot charge carriers enhance the rate of gold oxidation and subsequent electrodissolution. Importantly, we distinguish how hot holes generated from interband transitions versus hot holes around the Fermi level contribute to photooxidative dissolution. The results provide new insights into hot-hole-driven processes with relevance to photocatalysis while emphasizing the need for statistical descriptions of nonequilibrium processes on innately heterogeneous nanoparticle supports.

Especially, it is difficult to distinguish the contact killing from release killing as Ag+ releases from AgNPs. In this paper, AgNPs gradient was designed for evaluating the size effect of AgNPs on contact killing. A size gradient of AgNPs (5-45 nm) was achieved on TiO2 nanotubes (TNTs) by rational design of bipolar electrochemical reaction, including applied voltage, electrolyte concentration, and sample size. High-throughput investigation of cellular responses showed that the smallest AgNPs were the most efficient in suppressing bacteria whereas the largest AgNPs were more favorable for MC3T3-E1 cell adhesion and proliferation. As Ag+ concentration was the same for the entire gradient, the difference in cellular responses was dominated by the contact effect (rather than difference in released A(+)) which was tuned by AgNPs size. This method offers new prospect for efficient evaluation of the contact effect of nanoparticles, such as Ag, Au, and Cu.

Polarizable continuum models (PCM) have been gaining popularity because they offer a computationally inexpensive method of modeling the electrolyte. In this Perspective, we discuss challenges from using one such model which treats the ions using a linearized Poisson-Boltzmann (LPB) distribution. From a physical perspective, this model places charge unphysically close to the surface and adsorbates, and it includes excessively steep ramping of the dielectric constant from the surface to the bulk solvent. Both of these issues can be somewhat mitigated by adjusting parameters built into the model, but in doing so, the resultant capacitance deviates from experimental values. Likewise, hybrid explicit-implicit approaches to the solvent may offer a more realistic description of hydrogen bonding and solvation to reaction intermediates, but the corresponding capacitances also deviate from experimental values. These deviations highlight the need for a careful adjustment of parameters in order to reproduce not only solvation energies but also other physical properties of solid-liquid interfaces. Continuum approaches alone also necessarily do not capture local variations in the electric field from cations at the interface, which can affect the energetics of intermediates with substantial dipoles or polarizability. Finally, since the double layer charge can be varied continuously, LPB/PCM models provide a way to determine electrochemical barriers at constant potential. However, double-layer charging and the atomic motion associated with reaction events occur on significantly different timescales. We suggest that more detailed approaches, such as the modified Poisson-Boltzmann model and/or the addition of a Stern layer, may be able to mitigate some but not all of the challenges discussed.

However, safety and low cycling Coulombic efficiency (CCE) hinder the development of high-energy Li metal secondary batteries due to the high reactivity of Li metal with present electrolytes. Here, we investigate the reductive stability of nonflammable electrolytes with a wide salt to solvent ratio range and demonstrate that an ion-solvent-coordinated (ISC) nonflammable electrolyte-lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI)-triethylphosphate (TEP) enables dendrite-free Li metal plating/stripping on the Cu electrode with a high CCE of 99.3% up to 350 cycles. Understanding of the fundamental electrochemistry tells us that the decrease of solvent activity in ISC electrolyte can improve the reductive stability of the solvent on Li metal anodes. The fundamental concept of ISC electrolyte developed in this work provides new perspectives for the development of highly stable and safe Li metal batteries.

The electrodes were prepared from a biocatalyst ink composed of orientation-directing anthracene-modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes (An-MWCNTs) in a dispersion of ionomer exchanged by hydrophobic cations. The ink was applied to an electronically conductive carbon felt support that was hot-pressed to a Nafion-NRE 212 (51 mu m thickness) membrane, forming the framework for an air-breathing biofuel cell cathode. Infrared microscopy sampling was performed with the use of a micro-attenuated total reflection probe that enabled spectra to be recorded from similar to 32 mu m diameter circular spatial regions on the materials investigated. Sensitivity to deformation of the soft polymer membrane-based materials was assessed through trial experiments on pure membrane samples before approaching the compositionally more complex biofuel cell electrodes. In studies of laccase cathodes, infrared spectral features of enzyme, buffer anions and surrounding An-MWCNTs were identified. Heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of components and unexpected bands traceable to insoluble copper salts were detected. The results suggest directions for improving electrode activity and bring to light needs for advancing quantitative interpretations.

Here we report a strategy to fill this performance gap using the concept of Grotthuss proton conduction, in which proton transfer takes place by means of concerted cleavage and formation of O-H bonds in a hydrogen-bonding network. We show that in a hydrated Prussian blue analogue (Turnbull's blue) the abundant lattice water molecules with a contiguous hydrogen-bonding network facilitate Grotthuss proton conduction during redox reactions. When using it as a battery electrode, we find high-rate behaviours at 4,000 C (380 Ag-1, 508 mA cm(-2)), and a long cycling life of 0.73 million cycles. These results for diffusion-free Grotthuss topochemistry of protons, in contrast to orthodox battery electrochemistry, which requires ion diffusion inside electrodes, indicate a potential direction to revolutionize electrochemical energy storage for high-power applications.

J	Myers, RT; Ayers, J				Myers, Ryan T.; Ayers, Joseph			A nitric oxide sensor fabricated through e-jet printing towards use in bioelectronics interfaces	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Nitric oxide; Electrohydrodynamic jet; e-jet; 3D printing; Electrochemistry; Bioelectronics	ELECTROCHEMICAL SENSOR; GOLD NANOPARTICLES; PROTEIN; PERFORMANCE; SYNTHASE; RELEASE	We have developed a methodology for electrohydrodynamic printing of a nitric oxide (NO) sensor. The primary features of this amperometric methodology include the printing of carbon and metallic-based inks, the conversion of Ag to Ag:AgCl as a reference electrode, and the deposition of a nitric oxide selective layer on the working electrode, followed by an encapsulation to define the working area. The efficacy and enhancements of multiple printed layers has been examined. Multiple working electrode chemistries and combinations are presented, including the use of silver, graphene, NiTsPc, and gold in various combinations. Selectivity for NO was accomplished via a NafionO layer on the working electrode, effectively blocking interference from NO2- and NO3- at relatively high concentrations. The resultant flexible, thin film nitric oxide sensor is sensitive enough to monitor macrophage depolarization events without the need for additional micropipette or FRET-based electrochemical sensors. We demonstrate a valuable research tool that will have a high impact on the emerging field of synthetic biology by providing the capability to interface-engineered cellular sensors to microelectronics.

Real systems can be physically hard to reach, chemically dynamic, and sample collection and pretreatment fundamentally alter speciation. Therefore, there is great interest in in situ trace metal speciation sensors that can be integrated into on-site, portable analysis devices. Electrochemistry is an attractive method since the sensing component can be fashioned into a submersible probe. In this review, we define a set of criteria that an electrochemical approach must conform to for in situ metal analysis and review methods that closely follow these criteria. As an emerging technique, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry is introduced. Next, design and material of analysis probes is detailed, followed by a discussion of portable instrumentation. Finally, studies that show promise towards a portable, in situ metal analysis device are showcased and ongoing analytical challenges are outlined. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, the magnetic response associated with electron transfer from galvinoxyl radicals remains little understood. Here, new findings on magnetically-enhanced electron transfer (MEET) from immobilized galvinoxyl radicals are reported in an electrochemical study using galvinoxyl-gold electrodes. The electron transfer rate constant increases by about 78% in the presence of an external magnetic field of 1.32 mT compared to the electron transfer rate in the absence of a magnetic field. The MEET of organic radical layers on a solid electrode may also open up new avenues for the development of novel ferromagnetic nanostructures and devices.

This work is significant because it is the first demonstration that devices capable of fluid handling and electrochemical sensing can be produced in a single fabrication step using inexpensive equipment. We demonstrate the broad utility of this approach using a channel-flow configuration as an exemplary system for hydrodynamic electrochemistry. Unmodified devices were characterized using hydrodynamic electrochemistry, and behave according to the well-established Levich equation. We also characterized the fabrication reproducibility and found that the devices were within 3% RSD. The 3D-printed sensors we employed were subsequently modified by electroplating Au and used under flowing conditions to detect catechol, whose oxidation requires two electrons and two protons and is thus more challenging to analyze than the outer-sphere FcCH(2)OH. We envision these results will pave the way for the development of highly customized micro-total analysis systems that include embedded electrochemical sensors for a variety of redox-active analytes.

However, an examination of the Shilov cycle suggests that electrochemical regeneration of the Pt(IV) oxidant would allow for the system to be catalytic in platinum. We demonstrate that through judicious selection of applied electrical bias to near the initial open circuit potential of the reaction mixture (similar to 560 mV vs Ag/AgCl), Shilov-type hydroxylation of p-toluenesulfonic acid as a surrogate for methane can be electrocatalytically effected over a homogeneous Pt(II) catalyst, Na2PtCl4 in 0.5 M H2SO4, giving 8% yield of the alcohol product at 4.5 mol% catalyst loading with good Faradaic efficiency and without a co-catalyst or additional redox mediator. Methane can also be converted to methanol electrocatalytically with this system.

Protonation studies show that [Fe-3(CO)(9)(mu(3)-E)(2)] are unaffected by strong acids. Mono-capped [Fe-3(CO)(7)(mu(3)-CO)(mu(3)-E)(mu-dppm)] react with HBF4. Et2O but changes in IR spectra are attributed to BF3 binding to the face-capping carbonyl, while bicapped [Fe-3(CO)(7)(mu(3)-CO)(mu(3)-E)(mu-dppm)] are protonated but in a process that is not catalytically important. DFT calculations are presented to support these protonation studies. Cyclic voltammetry shows that [Fe-3(CO)(9)(mu(3)-E)(2)]exhibits two reduction waves, and upon addition of strong acids, protonreduction occurs at a range of potentials. Mono-chalcogenide clusters [Fe-3(CO)(7)(mu(3)-CO)(mu(3)-E)(mu-dppm)] (E = S, Se) exhibit proton-reduction at ca. -1.85 (E = S) and -1.62 V (E = Se) in the presence of p-toluene sulfonic acid (p-TsOH). Bicapped [Fe-3(CO)(7)(mu(3)-E)(2)(mu-dppm)] undergo quasi-reversible reductions at -1.55 (E = S) and -1.45 V (E = Se) and reduce p-TsOH to hydrogen but protonated species do not appear to be catalytically important. Current uptake is seen at the first reduction potential in each case, showing that [Fe-3(CO)(9)(mu(3)-E)(2)(mu-dppm)](-) are catalytically active but a far greater response is seen at ca. -1.9 V being tentatively associated with reduction of [H2Fe3(CO)(7)(mu(3)-E)(2)(mu-dppm)](+). In general, selenide clusters are reduced at slightly lower potentials than sulfide analogues and show slightly higher current uptake under comparable conditions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

To elucidate these problems, it is very important to analyze electrochemical degradation from a mechanical stress point of view. Specifically, the goal of this study is to investigate diffusion-induced stresses and electrochemical degradation in three-dimensional (3D) reconstructed LiFePO4. We generate a reconstructed microstructure by using a stack of focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM) images combined with an electrolyte domain. Our previous two-dimensional (2D) finite element model is further improved to a 3D multiphysics one, which incorporates both electrochemical and mechanical analyses. From our electrochemistry model, we observe 95.6% and 88.3% capacity fade at 1.2 C and 2 C, respectively. To investigate this electrochemical degradation, we present concentration distributions and von Mises stress distributions across the cathode with respect to the depth of discharge (DoD). Moreover, electrochemical degradation factors such as total polarization and over-potential are also investigated under different C-rates. Further, higher total polarization is observed at the end of discharging, as well as at the early stage of discharging. It is also confirmed that lithium intercalation at the electrode-electrolyte interface causes higher over-potential at specific DoDs. At the region near the separator, a higher concentration gradient and over-potential are observed. We note that higher over-potential occurs on the surface of electrode, and the resulting concentration gradient and mechanical stresses are observed in the same regions. Furthermore, mechanical stress variations under different C-rates are quantified during the discharging process. With these coupled mechanical and electrochemical analyses, the results of this study may be helpful for detecting particle crack initiation.

Twofold visible-light-induced oxidative cyclization of a phenanthrene framework selects for the desired PDI-helicene, despite the immense strain that distinguishes this helicene from two other accessible isomers. This strain arises from the extensive intramolecular overlap of the PDI subunits, which precludes racemization, even at elevated temperatures. Relative to a smaller homologue, this PDI-helicene exhibits amplified electronic circular dichroism. It also readily and reversibly accepts four electrons electrochemically. Modifications to the core phenanthrene subunit change the fluorescence and electrochemistry of the PDI-helicene without significantly impacting its electronic circular dichroism or UV-visible absorbance.

However, for a given reaction, it remains unclear which factors quantitatively determine whether these effects measurably contribute to surface reactivity in catalysis and photo/electrochemistry. Here, we systematically investigate hot electron effects during H-2 scattering from Ag(111) using electronic friction theory. We combine first-principles calculations of tensorial friction by time-dependent perturbation theory based on density functional theory and an analytical neural network representation, to overcome the limitations of existing approximations and explicitly simulate mode-specific nonadiabatic energy loss during molecular dynamics. Despite sizable hot-electron-induced energy loss, no measurable nonadiabatic effects can be found for H-2 scattering on Ag(111). This is in stark contrast to previous reports for vibrationally excited H-2 scattering on Cu(111). By detailed analysis of the two systems, we attribute this discrepancy to a subtle interplay between the magnitude of electronic friction along intramolecular vibration and the shape of the potential energy landscape that controls the molecular velocity at impact. On the basis of this characterization, we offer guidance for the search of highly nonadiabatic surface reactions.

J	Baskin, A; Prendergast, D				Baskin, Artem; Prendergast, David			Exploring chemical speciation at electrified interfaces using detailed continuum models	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL THEORY; SOLVATION FREE-ENERGIES; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS; PARTIAL CHARGE-TRANSFER; DOUBLE-LAYER; COMPUTATIONAL ELECTROCHEMISTRY; IONIC LIQUIDS; ADSORPTION; WATER; SURFACE	We present a local free-energy functional-based generic continuum model for material interfaces with a specific emphasis on electrified solid/liquid interfaces. The model enables a description of multicomponent phases at interfaces and includes the effects of specific non-electrostatic interactions (specific adsorption), ion size disparity, and the explicit presence of neutral species. In addition to the optimization of electrostatic, non-electrostatic, and steric forces, the model can be easily modified to explore the effects of other channels for equilibration, including local chemical transformations driven by equilibrium constants and electrochemical reactions driven by the electrode potential. In this way, we show that, upon accounting for these effects, local speciation in the vicinity of the interface can be drastically different from what is expected from restricted models and minor species (from the bulk perspective) may become dominant due to the effects of local pH. We evaluate the ionic contribution to the surface tension at the interface and show how this could impact the structure of air/liquid interfaces. On the same footing, an attempt to describe electrochemical metal dissolution is made. The model allows estimates of the mutual population of newly produced ions depending on their charge and size and could be useful for interpretation of electrochemical and spectroscopic measurements if the dissolution involves different metal ions (species). With these advances, the proposed model may be used as an ingredient within a hybrid ab initio-continuum methodology to model biased interfaces. Published under license by AIP Publishing.

Special Topic on Interfacial Electrochemistry and Photo(electro)catalysis	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article								Interfacial electrochemistry and photo(electro)catalysis are key processes that convert the energy of photons or electrons to chemical bonds in many energy conversion and storage technologies. Achieving a molecular level understanding of the fundamental interfacial structure, energetics, dynamics, and reaction mechanisms that govern these processes represents a broad frontier for chemical physics and physical chemistry. This Special Topic contains a collection of articles that range from the development of new experimental and computational techniques to the novel application of those techniques for mechanistic studies, as the principal investigators seek a fundamental molecular understanding of both electrode/electrolyte interfaces and the relevant electrocatalytic, photocatalytic, and photoelectrochemical reactions taking place thereabout.

Practical Aspects of Cyclic Voltammetry: How to Estimate Reduction Potentials When Irreversibility Prevails	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							PHOTOINDUCED ELECTRON-TRANSFER; FRONTIER ORBITALS; ELECTROCHEMICAL POTENTIALS; CHARGE-TRANSFER; FERROCENE; OXIDATION; STANDARD; DESIGN; COMPLEXES; CHEMISTRY	What is the best approach for estimating standard electrochemical potentials, E-(0), from voltammograms that exhibit chemical irreversibility? The lifetimes of the oxidized or reduced forms of the majority of known redox species are considerably shorter than the voltammetry acquisition times, resulting in irreversibility and making the answer to this question of outmost importance. Half-wave potentials, E-(1/2), provide the best experimentally obtainable representation of E-(0). Due to irreversible oxidation or reduction, however, the lack of cathodic or anodic peaks in cyclic voltammograms renders E-(1/2) unattainable. Therefore, we evaluate how closely alternative potentials, readily obtainable from irreversible voltammograms, estimate E-(0). Our analysis reveals that, when E-(1/2) is not available, inflection-point potentials provide the best characterization of redox couples. While peak potentials are the most extensively used descriptor for irreversible systems, they deviate significantly from E-(0), especially at high scan rates. Even for partially irreversible systems, when the cathodic peak is not as pronounced as the anodic one, the half-wave potentials still provide the best estimates for E-(0). The importance of these findings extends beyond the realm of electrochemistry and impacts fields, such as materials engineering, photonics, cell biology, solar energy engineering and neuroscience, where cyclic voltammetry is a key tool.

Metalation and Methyl Group Migration in 21-, 22-, and 23-Methylcarbaporphyrins: Synthesis and Characterization of Palladium(II), Rhodium(I), and Rhodium(III) Derivatives	ORGANOMETALLICS			English	Article							STRUCTURAL-CHARACTERIZATION; ORGANOMETALLIC CHEMISTRY; ASYMMETRIC CYCLOPROPANATION; PORPHYRIN SYNTHESIS; N-METHYL; COMPLEXES; COORDINATION; SPECTROSCOPY; CARBAPORPHYRINOIDS; ELECTROCHEMISTRY	A rational synthesis of 23-methylcarbaporphyrin has been developed. 3,4-Diethyl-1-methylpyrrole reacted with acetoxymethylpyrrole under acidic conditions to give N-methyltripyrrane, and following cleavage of the ester protective groups, the tripyrrolic intermediate condensed with an indene dialdehyde in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid to afford the required N-methylcarbaporphyrin. Reaction with palladium(II) acetate in refluxing acetonitrile for short time periods gave a 23-methyl palladium(II) complex but prolonged reaction times afforded a rearranged 21-methyl product. The 23 methyl complex can be isolated but gradually converts into the 21-methyl derivative even in the solid state. 21-Methyl- and 22-methylcarbaporphyrins reacted with [Rh(CO)(2)Cl](2) to give rhodium(I) complexes. However, when the 23-methylcarbaporphyrin was reacted under the same conditions, a rhodium-(III) derivative was isolated. This complex incorporates a bridging methylene unit between the Rh(III) and the 21-carbon and must therefore be formed by a methyl group migration-cyclization process.

Here, we report a platinum-trimer decorated cobalt-palladium core-shell nanocatalyst with a low platinum loading of only 2.4 wt% for the use in alkaline fuel cell cathodes. This ternary catalyst shows a mass activity that is enhanced by a factor of 30.6 relative to a commercial platinum catalyst, which is attributed to the unique charge localization induced by platinum-trimer decoration. The high stability of the decorated trimers endows the catalyst with an outstanding durability, maintaining decent electrocatalytic activity with no degradation for more than 322,000 potential cycles in alkaline electrolyte. These findings are expected to be useful for surface engineering and design of advanced fuel cell catalysts with atomic-scale platinum decoration.

J	Li, YB; Zhou, ZF; Wu, WT				Li, Yubai; Zhou, Zhifu; Wu, Wei-Tao			Three-dimensional thermal modeling of Li-ion battery cell and 50 V Li-ion battery pack cooled by mini-channel cold plate	APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Li-ion battery cell; Battery pack cooling; Thermal modeling; Cold plate; External shorting condition	MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM; LITHIUM/POLYMER BATTERY; DISCHARGE BEHAVIOR; MULTI-PHYSICS; PERFORMANCE; FLOW; CONFIGURATION; SIMULATIONS; DESIGN; MODULE	In this work, three-dimensional (3D) thermal modeling of a single Li-ion battery cell and a 50 V Li-ion battery pack composed of 14 prismatic batteries is performed. Equivalent circuit model is used for subscale electrochemical modeling. The heat generated by electrical resistance and electrochemistry reactions is then solved in the cell domain which resolves the heat transfer in battery and battery pack. The modeling provides highly resolved temporal 3D insight into thermal and battery dynamics under fast discharging and abusive condition. It is found that with low coolant velocity, the cell temperature easily exceeds 40 degrees C, and temperature non-uniformity exceeds the limit value of 5 degrees C under 5C discharging condition; and under external shorting condition, temperature rises fast and reaches the 80 degrees C point quickly which can further trigger thermal runaway. On the other hand, with adequate coolant flow rate, the cell temperature and temperature gradients are effectively limited to tolerable level under both 5C discharging and external shorting conditions. Thus, coolant rate needs to be carefully designed to prevent high temperature and localized high temperature spot in Li-ion battery. The modeling method used in this study can be applied to general Li-ion battery and Li-ion battery pack designing.

Synthetic, electrochemical, spectroscopic, and structural studies of mixed sandwich Co(III) complexes involving Cp or Cp* with tridentate N-donor and S-donor macrocycles	INORGANICA CHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Cobalt complexes; 1,4,7-Trithiacyclononane; 1,4,7-Triazacyclononane; Mixed sandwich complexes; Macrocyclic ligands	CROWN THIOETHER COMPLEXES; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURES; BOND ACTIVATION; RUTHENIUM COMPLEXES; THIOLATE-THIOETHER; TRANSITION-METALS; REDOX POTENTIALS; HYDROGEN-BONDS; COBALT; CHEMISTRY	The syntheses, structures, spectroscopy, and electrochemistry for four Co(III) mixed sandwich mononuclear complexes involving tridentate macrocycles and either cyclopentadienyl (Cp) or pentamethylcyclopentadienyl (Cp*) are reported. All complexes have the general formula [Co(Cp-R)([9]aneX(3))](PF6)(2), where X = S, 1,4,7-trithiacyclononane, and R = Cp (1) or Cp* (2), or X = N, 1,4,7-triazacyclononane, and R = Cp (3) or Cp* (4), and exhibit a pseudo-octahedral structure involving the carbocyclic eta(5)-Cp-R ligand and facial kappa(3)-donation from the macrocycle. The structures for all six complexes are supported by H-1 and C-13{H-1} NMR spectroscopy, and the compounds 1, 2, and 4 are also characterized by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. The H-1 NMR shows an AABB' splitting pattern for the coordinated macrocycle, and the dispersion between the two sets of multiplets is dependent upon the identity of the macrocycle. The [9]aneN(3) complexes show only a single reversible (4) or irreversible (3) + 3/ + 2 reduction in the -1.0 to - 1.4 V range vs. Fc/Fc(+). The [9]aneS(3) complexes show the same reversible (1) or quasi-reversible (2) reduction in the - 0.6 to - 0.9 V range vs. Fc/Fc(+) as well as a quasireversible (1) or irreversible (2) + 2/ + 1 reduction in the - 1.5 to - 1.8 V range vs. Fc/Fc(+).

Effective Distance for DNA-Mediated Charge Transport between Repair Proteins	ACS CENTRAL SCIENCE			English	Article							IRON-SULFUR CLUSTER; BASE-EXCISION-REPAIR; ENDONUCLEASE-III; ELECTRON-TRANSFER; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; DAMAGE RECOGNITION; 4FE4S CLUSTER; 1ST STEP; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; GLYCOSYLASE	The stacked aromatic base pairs within the DNA double helix facilitate charge transport down its length in the absence of lesions, mismatches, and other stacking perturbations. DNA repair proteins containing [4Fe4S] clusters can take advantage of DNA charge transport (CT) chemistry to scan the genome for mistakes more efficiently. Here we examine the effective length over which charge can be transported along DNA between these repair proteins. We define the effective CT distance as the length of DNA within which two proteins are able to influence their ensemble affinity to the DNA duplex via CT. Endonuclease III, a DNA repair glycosylase containing a [4Fe4S] cluster, was incubated with DNA duplexes of different lengths (1.5-9 kb), and atomic force microscopy was used to quantify the binding of proteins to these duplexes to determine how the relative protein affinity changes with increasing DNA length. A sharp change in binding slope is observed at 3509 base pairs, or about 1.2 mu m, that supports the existence of two regimes for protein binding, one within the range for DNA CT, one outside of the range for CT; DNA CT between the redox proteins bound to DNA effectively decreases the ensemble binding affinity of oxidized and reduced proteins to DNA. Utilizing an Endonuclease III mutant Y82A, which is defective in carrying out DNA CT, shows only one regime for protein binding. Decreasing the temperature to 4 degrees C or including metallointercalators on the duplex, both of which should enhance base stacking and decrease DNA floppiness, leads to extending the effective length for DNA charge transport to similar to 5300 bp or 1.8 mu m. These results thus support DNA charge transport between repair proteins over kilobase distances. The results furthermore highlight the ability of DNA repair proteins to search the genome quickly and efficiently using DNA charge transport chemistry.	[Tse, Edmund C.

J	Cao, Q; Puthongkham, P; Venton, BJ				Cao, Qun; Puthongkham, Pumidech; Venton, B. Jill			Review: new insights into optimizing chemical and 3D surface structures of carbon electrodes for neurotransmitter detection	ANALYTICAL METHODS			English	Review							NANOTUBE FIBER MICROELECTRODES; SIMULTANEOUS ELECTROCHEMICAL DETECTION; GRAPHENE-MODIFIED ELECTRODE; THIN-LAYER DIFFUSION; BORON-DOPED DIAMOND; ASCORBIC-ACID; GLASSY-CARBON; SELECTIVE DETECTION; POROUS LAYERS; SENSITIVE DETECTION	The carbon-fiber microelectrode has been used for decades as a neurotransmitter sensor. Recently, new strategies have been developed for making carbon electrodes, including using carbon nanomaterials or pyrolyzing a photoresist etched by nanolithography or 3D printing. This review summarizes how chemical and 3D surface structures of new carbon electrodes are optimized for neurotransmitter detection. There are effects of the chemical structure that are advantageous, and nanomaterials are used ranging from carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to graphene to nanodiamond. Functionalization of these materials promotes surface oxide groups that adsorb dopamine, and dopants introduce defect sites good for electron transfer. Polymer coatings such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) or Nafion also enhance the selectivity, particularly for dopamine over ascorbic acid. Changing the 3D surface structure of an electrode increases the current by adding more surface area. If the surface structure has roughness or pores on the micron scale, the electrode also acts as a thin layer cell, momentarily trapping the analyte for redox cycling. Vertically aligned CNTs as well as lithographically made or 3D printed pillar arrays act as thin layer cells, producing more reversible cyclic voltammograms. A better understanding of how the chemical and surface structure affects the electrochemistry enables rational design of electrodes. New carbon electrodes are being tested in vivo and strategies to reduce biofouling are being developed. Future studies should test the robustness for long term implantation, explore electrochemical properties of neurotransmitters beyond dopamine, and combine optimized chemical and physical structures for real-time monitoring of neurotransmitters.

We report herein a sustainable protocol for this transformation through C-H functionalization and is performed using electrochemistry as the main power source and tert-butyl hydroperoxide as the radical source for the C-H abstraction.

Herein, we report a facile cathodic deposition process that enables the large-area preparation of uniform films of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-8, ZIF-71, and ZIF-67) with highly tunable thickness ranging from approximately 24 nm to hundreds of nanometers. Importantly, this oxygen-reduction-triggered cathodic deposition does not lead to the plating of reduced metals (Zn and Co). It is also operable cost-effectively in the absence of supporting electrolyte and facilitates the construction of well-defined sub-micrometer-sized heterogeneous structures within ZIF films.

A prompt, low cost, single step, green and facile microwave assisted process was utilized to prepare PNDC materials using the aforementioned biomass. Concentration of the doping elements (P and N) was altered in the resulting PNDC materials by varying the mole ratio of used tea/molasses and ammonium polyphosphate (APP) in the reaction mixture. APP served as the Phosphorus and Nitrogen source as well as the microwave absorber. Detailed characterization of all four PNDCs - two derived from molasses (MOLPNDCs) and two from used tea leaves (TEAPNDCs), were performed to investigate their supercapacitor performance. These materials were characterized both physically via BET, XPS, and SEM analysis and electrochemically via cyclic voltammetry, in both 1 M H2SO4 and 6 M KOH. Pore size, surface area, and elemental compositions of each PNDC was analyzed to investigate the critical parameter for supercapacitor performance of the materials. Among all PNDCs, MOLPNDC-1 exhibited exceptionally high specific capacitance values of 160 Fg(-1) in 6 M KOH electrolyte due to highly mesoporous structure and appropriate Nitrogen content. MOLPNDC-1 was also found to be stable under continuous cycling for 1500 cycles in both acidic and alkaline conditions.

Here, Mg ions are successfully introduced into Na sites in addition to the conventional transition metal sites in P2-type Na-0.7[Mn0.6Ni0.4]O-2 as new cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Mg ions in the Na layer serve as "pillars" to stabilize the layered structure, especially for high-voltage charging, meanwhile Mg ions in the transition metal layer can destroy charge ordering. More importantly, Mg ion occupation in both sodium and transition metal layers will be able to create "Na-O-Mg" and "Mg-O-Mg" configurations in layered structures, resulting in ionic O 2p character, which allocates these O 2p states on top of those interacting with transition metals in the O-valence band, thus promoting reversible oxygen redox. This innovative design contributes smooth voltage profiles and high structural stability. Na0.7Mg0.05[Mn0.6Ni0.2Mg0.15]O-2 exhibits superior electrochemical performance, especially good capacity retention at high current rate under a high cutoff voltage (4.2 V). A new P2 phase is formed after charge, rather than an O2 phase for the unsubstituted material. Besides, multiple intermediate phases are observed during high-rate charging. Na-ion transport kinetics are mainly affected by elemental-related redox couples and structural reorganization. These findings will open new opportunities for designing and optimizing layer-structured cathodes for sodium-ion batteries.

Weak acids with super-electron-donor dimetal complexes: Synergy in bifunctional activity	POLYHEDRON			English	Article						Dimetal; Quadruple bond; Electrochemistry; Reductant; Protonation	MO-2(4+) COMPOUNDS; APPROXIMATION; MOLECULES; AGENTS; UNITS	Dimetal paddlewheel complexes with bicyclic guanidine ligands are extremely strong thermodynamic electron donors. As a probe of the chemical potential and sites for chemical reactivity of these complexes, the interaction of Mo-2(TEhpp)(4) with weak acids was investigated (TEhpp is the anion of the bicyclic guanidine 3,3,9,9-tetraethyl-1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0.]dec-4-ene). Mo-2(TEhpp)(4) is readily protonated by acetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid as expected, but surprisingly by a mechanism that is more complicated than a simple acid-base proton exchange. Electrochemistry measurements of the shifts in potentials with successive additions of acid reveals that the conjugate base of the acid plays a critical role throughout the reaction. Computations indicate that initially the acid hydrogen bonds to a TEhpp nitrogen atom bound to the metal, and then a facile rearrangement of the conjugate base toward the axial site of the Mo-Mo bond concomitantly results in protonation of the nitrogen atom. Interestingly, the dimetal complex is bifunctional in this process, acting as a nucleophile at the nitrogen atoms of the TEhpp ligands, and as an electrophile at the Mo-Mo axial bond sites. The protonation requires a novel synergism of these disparate bonding interactions, in which protonation is not favored without enhancement by the coordinated base, and coordination of the base is enhanced by the protonation.

A layer of triplex DNA assembled on electrodeposited reduced graphene oxide was used as the capture probe, and a subsequent hybridization chain reaction that promoted the efficient intercalation of the electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) emitter [Ru-(bpy)(2),(dppz)](2+) (bpy refers to 2,2'-bipyridine, and dppz refers to dipyrido[3,2-a:2',3'-c]phenazine) was used as an analytical-signal amplifier. The fabricated biosensor was examined with an anodic ECL mode using tri-n-propyl amine as the coreactant. The construction of the biosensor was systematically characterized with various techniques including atomic-force microscopy, gel electrophoresis, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical-impedance spectroscopy, and its performance was optimized under a variety of experimental conditions, especially the concentration of each reagent as well as the incubation time. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the reported biosensor showed a very low limit of detection of 0.10 fM (S/N = 3) and a wide linear dynamic range covering 0.50 fM to 100 pM toward microRNA-155 with excellent specificity, stability, and reproducibility. Finally, the biosensor was successfully applied to the detection of microRNA-155 extracted from the colon-cancer cell line DLD1, demonstrating its potential application in the sensitive detection of biological samples in the early diagnosis of diseases.

To achieve steady state conditions in the electrolyte phase, gate-tunable electrochemical flow cells were prepared by integrating a silicone microfluidic channel on the back-gated ZnO electrode. In these flow cells, continuous supply of fresh electrolyte generates time-invariant diffusion layers near the ZnO surface, allowing steady-state kinetic analysis as in other hydrodynamic methods. From the steady-state analysis, it was found that the electron density on the ZnO surface increases with the voltage bias, V-BG, applied to the back gate, while the rate constant for electron transfer decreases with V-BG. The observed trend can be explained as a result of the field-effect-induced band alignment shift at the ZnO/electrolyte interface which is predicted by our conceptual model; a positive back gate bias shifts the conduction band edge down at a given working electrode potential, leading to an increased surface electron density on ZnO, but simultaneously less overlap of the band edge with the electron acceptor states in solution, which means a lower electron transfer rate constant. Overall, the results quantitatively demonstrate that back gates and the ensuing field effect can be used to control kinetics of interfacial electron transfer at two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor electrodes.

The enthalpies of formation and the finite temperature thermodynamic properties of seven compounds are predicted by first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT), indicating five compounds (BaBi3, Ba11Bi10, Ba4Bi3, Ba5Bi3, and Ba2Bi) to be stable. Phase relations at 773 K and 858 K with composition x(Ba) = 0.90 are established by isothermal annealing and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) to clarify the previously observed phase transition at 796 K. The extremely low chemical activity of Ba in liquid for a wide range of temperatures and compositions indicates very strong short-range ordering in the liquid phase which is modeled in the present work by introducing the Ba4Bi3 and BaBi3 associates in the liquid phase. Both thermodynamic and phase equilibrium data are then used to evaluate the model parameters in Gibbs energy functions of the five stable compounds and three solution phases of liquid, bcc, and rhombohedral phases by the CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagram) technique. The present work shows that the Ba-Bi system consists of three eutectic reactions, two peritectic reactions, one peritectoid reaction, and two congruent reactions, as well as that the concentrations of associates are very high in the liquid phase with very low concentration of atomic Ba, which provides the fundamental understanding as to why Bi can be used to remove Ba ions from molten salt solutions.

Photoluminescence enhancement via microwave irradiation of carbon quantum dots derived from solvothermal synthesis of l-arginine	NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article							ELECTROGENERATED CHEMILUMINESCENCE; NANODOTS; FLUORESCENCE; YIELDS; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; PHOSPHORUS	Photoluminescence enhancement of carbon quantum dots was achieved via solvothermal synthesis followed by microwave irradiation. Nitrogen and phosphorous doped carbon quantum dots were prepared by solvothermal heating of l-arginine with phosphoric acid for 12 hours followed by microwave irradiation for 3 minutes. The photoluminescence enhancement was nearly two fold after microwave irradiation. The morphology, structure, and surface properties were the same for the solvothermal (CQDs-S) as well as after microwave (CQDs-M) irradiation. Thus, the enhancement is attributed to the decrease of surface defects within CQDs, which led to a decrease in the non-radiative transitions. The CQDs were quenched selectively by Fe3+ ions. The quenching led to the fabrication of the fluorescence probe for ferric ion determination. The CQDs-M had a low detection limit of 4.0 nM, while CQDs-S had a limit of 50 nM. This study gives a tool for enhancing photoluminescence quantum yields, which is highly desired for biosensing and bioimaging applications.	[Omer, Khalid M.; Aziz, Kosar H.

As an important family of functional materials, transition metal oxides are generally believed inactive towards hydrogen evolution reaction, although many of them show high activity for oxygen evolution reaction. Here we report the remarkable electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction of a layered metal oxide, Ruddlesden-Popper-type Sr2RuO4 with alternative perovskite layer and rock-salt SrO layer, in an alkaline solution, which is comparable to those of the best electrocatalysts ever reported. By theoretical calculations, such excellent activity is attributed mainly to an unusual synergistic effect in the layered structure, whereby the (001) SrO-terminated surface cleaved in rock-salt layer facilitates a barrier-free water dissociation while the active apical oxygen site in perovskite layer promotes favorable hydrogen adsorption and evolution. Moreover, the activity of such layered oxide can be further improved by electrochemistry-induced activation.

Recently, tremendous effort has been invested to elucidate the sodium storage mechanism in HC, and to explore synthetic approaches that can enhance the performance and lower the cost. However, disagreements remain in the field, particularly on the fundamental questions of ion transfer and storage and the ideal HC structure for high performance. This Minireview aims to provide an analysis and summary of the theoretical limitations of HC, discrepancies in the storage mechanism, and methods to improve the performance. Finally, future research on developing ideal structured HCs, advanced electrolytes, and optimized electrolyte-electrode interphases are proposed on the basis of recent progress.

Herein, the redox-active dipyrrin-1,9-dione fragment, which is characteristic of the propentdyopent family of heme metabolites and urinary pigments, is employed for the synthesis of a BODIPY analog. This boron difluoride complex exhibits bright fluorescence in organic solvents and a significant ipsochromic shift to the cyan region when compared to typical green BODIPY dyes. Electrochemical and spectroscopic measurements show that the dipyrrindione ligand acts as an electron reservoir by hosting an unpaired spin upon one-electron reduction. This ligand-based redox event reversibly abolishes the fluorescence emission, thus switching off the novel electrofluorochromic system.

Sandwiched Graphene Interdiffusion Barrier for Preserving Au@Pt Atomically Thin Core@Shell Structure and the Resulting Oxygen Reduction Reaction Catalytic Activity	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						graphene; Pt; monolayer; catalysis; oxygen reduction reaction; surface chemistry; diffusion barrier	LAYER-BY-LAYER; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; HIGH-TEMPERATURE; FUEL-CELLS; HYBRID; NANOPARTICLES; ELECTROCATALYSTS; DIFFUSION; TRANSPORT	The concept of a core shell metallic structures, with a few atomic layers of the "shell" metal delineated from the "core" metal with atomic sharpness opens the door to a multitude of surface-driven materials properties that can be tuned. However, in practice, such architectures are difficult to retain due to the entropic cost of a segregated near-surface architecture, and the core and surface atoms inevitably mix through interdiffusion over time. We present here a systematic study of interdiffusion in a Pt on Au core shell architecture and the role of an interrupting single layer of graphene sandwiched between them. The physical and chemical structure of the (near)surface is probed via mean-free-path tuned X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and electrochemistry (the oxygen reduction reaction, ORR). We find that at operating temperatures above 100 degrees C, there is potential for interdiffusion to occur between the primary and support metals of the core shell catalyst system, which can diminish the catalyst activity toward ORR The introduction of a single-layer graphene, as an interface between the core and shell metal layers, acts as a barrier that prevents unwanted surface alloying between the layered metals. HRTEM imaging shows that fully wetted Pt monolayers can be grown on a graphene template, allowing a high level of surface utilization of the catalyst material. We present how the use of graphene as a barrier to diffusion mitigates the loss of surface catalytic sites, showing much improved retention of Pt monolayer surface at elevated temperatures.

Semiconductor nanomaterials with a highly accessible surface area, reduced charge migration distance, and tunable optical and electronic property are regarded as promising electrode materials to carry out this solar-to-hydrogen process. Since most of the photo-electrochemical reactions take place on the electrode surface or near-surface region, rational engineering of the surface structures, physical properties, and chemical nature of photoelectrode materials could fundamentally change their performance. Here, the recent advances in surface engineering methods, including the modification of the nanomaterial surface morphology, crystal facet, defect and doping concentrations, as well as the deposition of a functional overlayer of sensitizers, plasmonic metallic structures, and protective and catalytic materials are highlighted. Each surface engineering method and how it affects the structural features and photo-electrochemical performance of nanomaterials are reviewed and compared. Finally, the current challenges and the opportunities in the field are discussed.

The binding of dithiocarbamate ligand is accompanied by the dissociation of Ru-O and Ru-Cl bonds along with concomitant prototropic shift from iminium-phenolato to imine-phenol motif. The reaction also involves a sterically controlled change in rotational conformation in going to the products. The X-ray crystal structure of [Ru(eta(1)-ClL)(PPh3)(2)(CO)((DTC)-D-Et)] (2(Cl)((DTC)-D-Et)) has been described here. An account of different spectral (UV-Vis, IR, NMR) and electrochemical data of the complexes are also asserted. Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) analyses were performed to scrutinize the electronic structure and the absorption spectra of the complexes. One of the dithiocarbamato complexes has also been found to have in vitro antiproliferative properties against MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line which was determined by MTT assay.

However, these complex systems lack an efficient screening platform for evaluating their progression. A paper-based microfluidic platform was developed to monitor cascade systems without the need for off-line product verification. Two types of paper-based platforms were fabricated to facilitate this study: electrochemical and spectro-electrochemical. Electrochemical platforms were integrated with stencil-printed electrodes and used to perform electrochemical alcohol oxidation reactions with two derivatives of the organocatalyst TEMPO (TEMPO=2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyl-N-oxyl). The catalyst 4-amino-TEMPO (TEMPO-NH2) was used as a model catalyst that was studied not immobilized and immobilized (pyrene-amido-TEMPO) on electrochemical platforms. These platforms were designed to provide quasi-stationary flow allowing constant electrochemical data collection as catalytic reactions proceeded. TEMPO-NH2 and pyrene-amido-TEMPO were evaluated for the partial oxidation of glycerol and its intermediates. In comparison to TEMPO-NH2, the pyrene-amido-TEMPO catalyst produced higher current outputs. Spectro-electrochemical platforms were integrated with stencil-printed electrodes, and a surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) detection zone. The spectro-electrochemical platforms allowed for catalytic conversions at the electrodes and subsequent delivery of catalytically transformed analytes to a SERS detection zone for product analysis. This platform was demonstrated for pyrene-amido-TEMPO and was shown to convert glycerol to mesoxalic acid. The experimental procedures for making components of the spectro-electrochemical device were described and include: preparation of the paper-based platform, construction of stencil-printed electrodes, and fabrication of SERS detection zones. These platforms provide an approach to analyzing multi-step cascade chemical reactions.

Although its scientific inquiries nearly date back to the inception of electrochemistry, its behavior at microscopic dimensions (relevant to battery application) is mysteriously uncontrollable. We examine experimental reports of singular spatiotemporal evolutions with a hope to identify universality in deposition patterns. We conclude that a macroscopic mass transport instability cannot account for various growth morphologies and alludes to poorly understood materials interplay at smaller scales.

The results revealed that the variation in corrosion resistance of 205 stainless steels containing Ce was higher than specimen without Ce, which depended on Sigma 3(n) boundaries and Ce modifying inclusion treatment. Ce addition to steels was prone to forming fine and dispersive Ce multi-phase inclusions containing CeAIO(3), CeS and Ce2O2S. When addition of Ce was up to 0.016 wt.%, its textures were characterized by pronounced gamma-fiber textures comprising {111} < 110 > and {111} < 112 > components, as well as the frequency of Sigma 3(n) boundaries related to {111} < 112 >, {111} < 110 > and {112} < 110> components was significantly improved, which was in favor of corrosion resistance improvement. While adding 0.023 wt.%Ce element was detrimental to corrosion resistance of stainless steel.

Naguib, J. Come, B. Dyatkin, V. Presser, P. Taberna, P. Simon, M. W. Barsoum, and Y. Gogotsi, Electrochemistry Communications 16, 61-64 (2012); B. Anasori, M. R. Lukatskaya, and Y. Gogotsi, Nature Reviews Materials vol. 2, 16098 (2017)]. Their large specific surface area and the tunability of their physicochemical properties as a function of the transition metal and surface terminal group make them a unique design platform for various applications, a primary example of which is pseudocapacitive energy storage. However, there is still incomplete understanding of how the transition metal chemistry and stoichiometry, and the surface termination affect charge storage mechanisms in MXene. In this study, we have performed systematic first-principles calculations for bulk MXene and found that the atomic charge of the metal cations, which is related to their valence, decreases across the d-electron metal series. Electronic-structure indicators of performance are examined to understand the energy storage behavior, whereby charges are stored between the terminal groups and adsorbing cations. Importantly, we found that the differential Bader charges show good agreement with theoretical capacitances and are useful in predicting charge storage trends in MXene-based pseudocapacitors. Furthermore, we have performed first-principles and grand canonical Monte Carlo calculations for the slab systems, finding that the solvent plays a critical role in enhancing the pseudocapacitive response.

In this review, we describe the development of electrochemical measurements of neurotransmitters and how they started with extrasynaptic measurements but now are pushing toward synaptic measurements. Traditionally, biosensors or fast-scan cyclic voltammetry have monitored extrasynaptic levels of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, serotonin, adenosine, glutamate, and acetylcholine. Amperometry and electrochemical cytometry techniques have revealed mechanisms of exocytosis, suggesting partial release. Advances in nanoelectrodes now allow spatially resolved, electrochemical measurements in a synapse, which is only 20-100 nm wide. Synaptic measurements of dopamine and acetylcholine have been made. In this article, electrochemical measurements are also compared to optical imaging and mass spectrometry measurements, and while these other techniques provide enhanced spatial or chemical information, electrochemistry is best at monitoring real-time neurotransmission. Future challenges include combining electrochemistry with these other techniques in order to facilitate multisite and multianalyte monitoring.	[Shin, Mimi; Wang, Ying; Borgus, Jason R.; Venton, B.

Especially for ion diffusion - one of the main processes found in electrochemical energy storage materials - crystallography can describe and evaluate the elementary steps for the hopping of mobile species from one crystallographic site to another. By translating this knowledge into parameters and search for similar numbers in other materials, promising compounds for future energy storage materials can be identified. Large crystal structure databases like the ICSD, CSD, and PCD have accumulated millions of measured crystal structures and thus represent valuable sources for future data mining and big-data approaches. In this work we want to present, on the one hand, crystallographic approaches based on geometric and crystal-chemical descriptors that can be easily applied to very large databases. On the other hand, we want to show methodologies based on ab initio and electronic modelling which can simulate the structure features more realistically, incorporating also dynamic processes. Their theoretical background, applicability, and selected examples are presented.	[Meutzner, F.; Nestler, T.; Zschornak, M.; Leisegang, T.; Meyer, D.

Improvement and stabilization of the electrochemical properties of zinc alloys during casting	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CORROSION AND SCALE INHIBITION			English	Article						sacrificial anodes; structure; foundry; electrochemistry		The main reasons for the appearance of electrochemical heterogeneity of cast sacrificial galvanic anodic alloys in the "metal-electrolyte" system are internal factors related to the nature of the metal, its composition, structure, etc. Obviously, when developing the technology for manufacturing of cast anodes, special attention should be paid to ensuring the structural homogeneity of the alloys. The main role in the formation of the structure and basic properties of cast anodes is played by thermal processes that affect the conditions for solidification of the melt in the mould. The results of studies of the structure and basic electrochemical properties of cast zinc sacrificial alloys (ZSA) depending on the cooling conditions are presented in this paper. The analysis of the temperature fields of the solidifying metal (when the metal is cooled) and the shape (when the mould is heated) at different cooling intensities has made it possible to optimize the duration of the casting cycle. This takes into account the cooling conditions determined by the initial temperature of the mould, which ensures a homogeneous structure and stable electrochemical properties of the material over the entire thickness of the tread. For example, it is established that for the casting of zinc alloys treads weighing 18 kg, the temperature of the mould before casting should be 120-160 degrees C. In these conditions, the necessary quality of cast sacrificial anodic alloys is achieved: Current Capacity-Efficiency 93-96%; Corrosion Potential -E-c = 815-820 mV vs. SHE. The required duration of the casting cycle is 10-14 min. Similar data was obtained for sacrificial anodes of various shapes and sizes. Based on the results of studies of the thermal interaction of zinc anodes with a casting mould (sandy-argillaceous, cast iron and steel water-cooled) using numerical simulation methods, the expediency of casting anodes into water-cooled moulds is provided, providing the most favorable conditions for heat removal and obtaining a homogeneous structure of cast treads.

Evidence and Influence of Copper Vacancies in p-Type CuGaO2 Mesoporous Films	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						CuGaO2; delafossite; p-type metal oxide; hole transport; heterojunction solar cell	HOLE TRANSPORT LAYER; HYDROTHERMAL SYNTHESIS; CUPROUS DELAFOSSITES; DEFECT MECHANISMS; THIN-FILMS; DYE; PHOTOCATHODES; WATER; NIO; SEMICONDUCTOR	Delafossite CuGaO2 nanocrystals were hydrothermally synthesized and characterized spectroscopically and electrochemically as mesoporous thin films. The nanocrystals demonstrate a preferred orientation within the film structure, as shown by enhancement of the (001) peaks via two-dimensional powder X-ray diffraction. Annealing conditions of low and high temperature (i.e., 100-300 degrees C), with oxygen and/or argon atmospheres, were investigated, and the resulting effect on the thin film electrochemistry was measured. Cyclic voltammetry showed an increase in non-faradaic current with higher annealing temperatures and demonstrated a quasi-reversible redox feature (E-1/2 = 0.1 V vs Fc(+1/0)). This feature is assigned to a Cu-II/Cu-I redox couple associated with surface defects. X-ray photoelectron and energy dispersive spectroscopies provide evidence for Cu-II surface defects and copper vacancies. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed that CuGaO2 films were highly conductive with sigma similar to 10(-5) Omega cm(-1), consistent with a large density of hole carriers induced by copper vacancies. The significance of synthesis, film preparation, and annealing conditions on the presence of surface defects and large hole densities is discussed. The prevalence of such defects in delafossite CuGaO2 is expected to have a large impact on the use of this material as a hole transport layer in solar cell architectures.	[Bredar, Alexandria R.

An electrochemical technique for controlled dissolution of zirconium based components of light water reactors	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							MAGNETIC BARKHAUSEN EMISSION; HYDRIDE EMBRITTLEMENT; ZIRCALOY-4 PLATE; FATIGUE DAMAGE; THERMOGRAPHY; ELECTRODES; BEHAVIOR; METALS; ZRO2	Zircaloy-4 (Zr-4) based liners and getters are the principle functional components of Tritium-Producing Burnable Absorber Rods (TPBARs) in light water nuclear reactors where they reduce tritiated water into tritium gas. Upon tritium exposure, zirconium tritide is formed, which changes the chemical composition, structure and morphology of these materials. Their thermodynamic properties are affected by (i) the hydride phase identity, (ii) radial and spatial tritide/hydride (T/H) distribution, and (iii) the changes in structure and morphology of the material upon T/H-migration, and their comprehensive knowledge is needed to predict performance of these materials. This work demonstrates that controlled potential electrochemistry techniques to be highly efficient for controlled oxidative radial dissolution of Zr-4 based liners (both unloaded and loaded with hydride/deuteride as chemical surrogates for tritium). The electrodissolution is further combined with microscopic techniques to accurately determine the distribution of hydride phases. This work demonstrates a reliable technique for radially etching the liners after irradiation to provide insight into the radial and spatial distribution of tritium within the TPBAR, improving the fundamental understanding of tritium transport and providing a basis for validating predictive models.

Herein, an electrochemical cell coupled with ion soft landing is employed to examine the effect of "atom-by-atom" metal substitution on the activity and stability of well-defined redox-active anions, PMoxW12-xO403- (x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, or 12) at nanostructured ionic liquid EEI. A striking observation made by in situ electrochemical measurements and further supported by theoretical calculations is that the substitution of only one to three tungsten atoms by molybdenum atoms in the PW12-xO403- anions results in a substantial spike in their first reduction potential. Specifically, PMo3W9O403- showed the highest redox activity in both in situ electrochemical measurements and as part of a functional redox supercapacitor device, making it a "super-active redox anion" compared with all other PMoxW12-xO403- species. Electronic structure calculations showed that metal substitution in PMoxW12-xO403- causes the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) to protrude locally, making it the "active site" for reduction of the anion. Several critical factors contribute to the observed trend in redox activity including (i) multiple isomeric structures populated at room temperature, which affect the experimentally determined reduction potential; (ii) substantial decrease of the LUMO energy upon replacement of W atoms with more-electronegative Mo atoms; and (iii) structural relaxation of the reduced species produced after the first reduction step. Our results illustrate a path to achieving superior performance of technologically relevant EEIs in functional nanoscale devices through understanding of the molecular-level electronic properties of specific electroactive species with "atom-by-atom" precision.

A neutral charged sensing environment is constructed by an antibody with an oppositely charged amino acid as surface charge neutralizer. By adjusting the pH condition of the testing environment, this neutral charged immunosensor (NCI) directly utilizes the electrostatic charges of the analyte for quantification of circulating protein markers, achieving a wide dynamic range covering through the whole picomole level. Comparing with previous studies on electrostatic charges characterization, this NCI demonstrates its capability to analyze not only the negatively charged biomolecules but also positively charged analytes. We applied this NCI for the detection of HE4 antigen with a detection limit at 2.5 pM and Tau antigen with a detection limit at 0.968 pM, demonstrating the high-sensitivity property of this platform. Furthermore, this NCI possesses a simple fabrication method (less than 2 h) and a short testing turnaround time (less than 30 min), providing an excellent potential for further clinical point-of-care applications.

In this paper, Alizarin Red S (ARS), an electroactive anthraquinone dye, is employed to construct LbL (BPEI/ARS)(n) films with branched poly(ethylene imine) (BPEI) as the complementary polymer. Unconventional LbL methods, including co-adsorption of ARS and poly(4-styrene sulfonate) (PSS) with BPEI to assemble (BPEI/(ARS+PSS))(n), as well as pre-complexation of ARS with BPEI and further assembly with PSS to fabricate ((BPEI+ARS)/PSS)(n), are designed for investigation and comparison. Film growth patterns, UV-Vis spectra and surface morphology of the three types of LbL assemblies are measured and compared to reveal the formation mechanism of the LbL films. Electrochemical properties including cyclic voltammetry and spectroelectrochemistry of (BPEI/ARS)(120), (BPEI/(ARS+PSS))(120) and ((BPEI+ARS)/PSS)(120) films are studied, and the results show a slight color change due to the redox reaction of ARS. ((BPEI+ARS)/PSS)(120) shows the best stability among the three samples. It is concluded that the manner of dye- incorporation has a great effect on the electrochemical properties of the resultant films.

When the number of gold atoms is sufficiently small, the clusters exhibit molecular properties. Their study requires extensive use of classic molecular physical chemistry and, thus, methods such as vibrational spectroscopies, electrochemistry, density functional theory and molecular dynamics calculations, and of course nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies. NMR and EPR studies have been mostly carried out on the benchmark, stable molecules Au-25(SR)(18), AU(38)(SR)(24), Au-102(SR)(44), and Au-144(SR)(60) (where SR = thiolate). In this Account, we showcase examples primarily taken from our previous and ongoing NMR and EPR studies, which we hope will trigger further interest in the use of these sensitive, though often underutilized, techniques. Indeed, 1D and 2D NMR spectra of pure, atomically precise clusters can be very detailed and informative. Molecular clusters are molecules and, thus, have discrete energy levels and undergo stepwise oxidation or reduction. The effect of the charge state on the chemical shifts and line shapes is a function of the ligand type (ligands differ due to specific bonds with different Au atom types) and the position of the chemical group along the ligand backbone: for groups near the Au core, they can be very dramatic. Ligand-protected gold clusters are hard-soft molecules where a hard metal core is surrounded by a dynamic molecular layer. The latter provides a nanoenvironment that interfaces the cluster core with the surrounding environment and can be permeated by molecules and ions. NMR spectroscopy is especially useful to assess its structure. For example, the data show that whereas long alkanethiolates form bundles, shorter chains exhibit more conformational freedom and are quite folded. NMR spectroscopy allows studying diastereotopic effects and provides information on possible hydrogen bonds of ligands with sulfur or surface gold atoms. EPR spectroscopy is a very precise technique to check and characterize the magnetic state of gold clusters or clusters doped with foreign-metal atoms. Electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) provides a powerful tool to assess the interaction of an unpaired electron with nuclei, as we showed for Au-197 and H-1. It can be used as a sensitive probe of the spin-density distribution in nanoclusters: for example, it showed that the singly occupied molecular orbital may span outside the Au core by nearly 6 angstrom. Solid-state EPR spectroscopy has provided compelling evidence that the specific ligands and the crystallinity degree are very important factors in determining the interactions between clusters in the solid state. Depending on the condition, paramagnetic, superparamagnetic, ferromagnetic, or antiferromagnetic behavior can be observed. Time-resolved EPR was successfully tested to determine the efficiency of singlet-oxygen generation via sensitization of Au-25 clusters. This Account thus demonstrates some of the remarkable insights that can be gained into the properties of atomically precise clusters through detailed NMR and EPR studies.

As a key element in electrocatalysis, the surface chemistry of electrocatalysts may strongly influence the catalytic activity and reaction mechanism, the fundamental understanding of which would provide guidance for designing high-efficiency catalysts. Herein, we utilized our recently developed in situ liquid SIMS approach to investigate the electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol on gold surfaces in alkaline environments involved in direct alcohol fuel cells. Formation of adsorbed hydroxide intermediates on the gold surfaces upon electro-oxidation was molecularly witnessed under operando conditions, the evolution of which was revealed to govern the electrocatalytic processes. Moreover, the hydroxide intermediates as active sites participated in the reaction by transferring nucleophilic hydroxyl groups into the adjacent ethoxy molecules. This work brings new light into electrocatalytic research and will facilitate the improvement of catalytic systems on the basis of a surface chemistry-catalytic performance relationship.

Various operating parameters such as electrolysis time, inter-electrode distance and initial pH were carried out to determine the efficient process condition on the removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD). biological oxygen demand (BOD) and suspended solids (SS). The highest treatment was achieved at 50 min with the removal efficiencies for COD, BOD and SS obtained as 85%, 83%, and 84%, respectively. More than 50 min treatment showed the fluctuated trends of removal efficiencies which can be considered insignificant. The application of higher current resulted in higher removals of organics while the gas bubbles also assisted in removing the pollutant partides by floatation. In an inter-electrode distance study, the removal efficiency decreased when inter-electrode distance was either higher or lower than 10 mm due to the increase of solution resistance and the decrease of anode active surface area. In initial pH study, it was found that high removal efficiencies were achieved in slightly acidic POME sample rather than in neutral or basic condition. An electrocoagulation process by using the optimum operating parameters was able to remove COD, BOD and SS up to 95%, 94% and 96% respectively. The experimental results confirm that application of high current intensity in electrocoagulation provided high treatment efficiency at a reduced reaction time.

In this laboratory exercise, students will focus on the anodization of bismuth metal to develop thin oxide films. When designing an electrolytic cell devoted to anodization, there are several major factors necessary for the optimization of the cell and these are explored in this experiment. Current density, electrolyte concentration, breakdown voltage, and anodization rate all impact development of these anodic oxide films. This exercise emphasizes the interrelationships between these critical factors and the best way to optimize an electrolytic cell. This procedure is carried out with standard chemicals and widely available technology to allow for an inexpensive and accessible laboratory experiment.

This provides the reaction with a white solid surface in which color change can be clearly observed and reduces reagent amounts required to 540 mu L per group. After data acquisition, students are required to calculate reaction orders and the reaction constant k, culminating in their ability to discern the rate equation for this reaction.

The laminated membrane approach potentially further improves flow resistance by dramatically reducing the surface area to volume ratio, but also produces a cohesive device that can be more readily applied to a broad range of applications. In addition, this new fabrication method was implemented in a scalable, commercial process and resulting product demonstrations indicate that volume manufacturing is feasible. Characterization of laminated membrane electrodes reveal redox cycling amplification factors as high as 30 with linear responses to variable concentrations of redox couple. These performance characteristics are shown to be comparable to similar generator-collector systems fabricated through much more laborious laboratory methods. This combination of added versatility, cost-reduced fabrication and exceptional performance clearly reveals unrealized potential of track-etch membrane approaches and boosts their candidacy as powerful new options for generator-collector electrode systems.

The geometries and electronic structures associated with 2 and 5 were evaluated by DFT calculations. Photophysical properties indicated that these systems possess delocalized structures, and their optoelectronic properties can be tuned by extending the pi-conjugated length and introducing electronic-withdrawing groups. The compounds were thoroughly investigated by XRD studies, electrochemistry and DFT calculations. High thermal stability and tunable energy levels make them excellent candidates as a class of organic molecular materials.

Despite numerous studies and proposed mechanisms, the exact nature of the active phase is still a topic of discussion. In this work, we employ operando attenuated total reflection surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) to investigate different sites available on Cu-poly and OD-Cu surfaces using CO as a probe molecule. We identify a CO adsorption band on OD-Cu at 2058 cm(-1) that is different from those on Cu-poly but resembles CO bound to the Cu(100) facet. In accordance with reactivity studies, we propose that this band corresponding to distinct CO binding sites is responsible for OD-Cu's enhanced CO reduction activity.

Precursor salts, H2PtCl6 and Pd(NO3)(2), were dissolved in a 1 mM sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) water droplet with 1 x phosphate buffered saline solution and suspended in a dichloroethane (DCE) continuous phase. Tetrabutylammonium perchlorate was added to the DCE continuous phase to maintain charge balance during electrodeposition. NP fabrication via electrodeposition was driven by droplet collisions onto HOPG, which was biased at a potential where the metal precursor salts would reduce to their respective zero-valent atoms. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) were used to study the size, coverage, and morphology of the NPs as well as the atomic stoichiometry. EDX mapping indicated homogeneous distribution of Pd and Pt at the single NP level. Homogeneously alloyed PdPt NPs were realized from this study with demonstrated control over metal composition, surface coverage, and NP size.

Considerable effort has been put into understanding its formation and electrochemistry under realistic battery conditions, but mechanistic insights have mostly been inferred indirectly. Here we show the formation of the SEI between a graphite anode and a carbonate electrolyte through combined atomic-scale microscopy and in situ and operando techniques. In particular, we weigh the graphitic anode during its initial lithiation process with an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance, which unequivocally identifies lithium fluoride and lithium alkylcarbonates as the main chemical components at different potentials. In situ gas analysis confirms the preferential reduction of cyclic over acyclic carbonate molecules, making its reduction product the major component in the SEI. We find that SEI formation starts at graphite edge sites with dimerization of solvated Li+ intercalation between graphite layers. We also show that this lithium salt, at least in its nascent form, can be re-oxidized, despite the general belief that an SEI is electrochemically inert and its formation irreversible.

The passive film displays both n-type and p-type semiconductor character in different potential regions of the passive state. The band gap energy of barrier layer of the passive film was 2.4 similar to 2.75 eV. Additionally, the composition of passive film was analyzed by AR-XPS; at -400 similar to 100 mV(SCE) and above 600 mV(SCE) Fe2O3, Fe3O4, FeOOH and CrO3 dominate the passive film, showing n-type semi-conductivity; while at 100 similar to 600 mV(SCE) the passive film comprises FeO, Cr2O3 and Cr(OH)(3), exhibiting p-type semi-conductivity.

These oligomers show excellent thermal stability with no significant weight loss below 350 degrees C in nitrogen atmosphere. During the electrochemical reoxidation process, the oligomer films exhibit two pairs of obvious redox peaks with the strong color changes from yellowish of neutral state to green and blue of oxidized state, and remain good continuous cyclic stability over 500s with a cycle time of 10s. The electrofluorescent properties of the oligomers also can be tuned by electrochemistry redox, exhibiting high contrast. Meanwhile, non-volatile rewritable flash memory devices were produced with the sandwich structure ITO/oligomer/Al, which could gain the ON/OFF current ratio as high as about 10(4) at low threshold voltage of 1.2 V.

Yet, the large volume expansion (similar to 104 vol%) during Li-Te alloying process prevents the application of Li-Te battery. Here, by using a novel one-step nonlinear electrochemical approach, we prepared a TexSy@polyaniline nanorod composites, in which elemental sulfur is successfully embedded into tellurium matrix to effectively tackle the volumetric variation problem. In situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the Li-Te (de) alloying process on single TexSy@polyaniline particle demonstrated that the volumetric variation was efficiently suppressed in comparison to the situation of pristine Te particles. Moreover, polyaniline binder effectively trapped Te and sulfur species in its network and guaranteed stable electric contact and fast transport of Li ions, which resulted in significant improvement of the battery performance. Interestingly, the as-obtained composites display a high initial capacity of 1141 mA h g(-1) with typical Li-S battery characteristics at a low current density of 0.1 A g(-1), while it shows a good cycling stability at high current density of 5 A g(-1) with Li-Te battery features.

Here, we present a strategy to enable porous N-doped Fe3C@C matrix to better entrap polyselenide and enhance the capability of the cell, whereby Fe3C serves as an efficient polyselenide reservoir via stronger chemisorption, as clearly evidenced by experimental analysis and DFT simulations. The as-fabricated half cells with 72.6 wt.% selenium content exhibit highly reversible capacities of 620 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C rate and 405mA h g(-1) at a high rate of 5 C. Moreover, the cell provides superior static stability (shelf-life) as illustrated by its 98.7% capacity retention even after storing for three months. This material is also paired with Na3V2O2(PO4)(2)F cathode in full cells to realize a stable discharge capacity of 108 mAh g(-1) (based on the weights of both the anode cathode) at 0.1 C rate over 50 cycles, thus demonstrating N-doped Fe3C@C a superior host for sodium-selenium batteries.

Two different types of adhesion, namely: silicon oxide and plasma silicon oxide films were grown on AISI 304 with the aid of an atomic-layer deposition technique. The effects of the surface preparations on the functionality and the properties of the hydrophobic silane coating were characterized, using the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the atomic force microscope (AFM) for morphology and topography. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and attenuated Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR-ATR) were used for the chemical composition and the bonding structure, the water contact angle were measured and processed, as well as the determination of electrochemistry of the coated and uncoated surfaces. The results showed that the silicon oxide treated surface improved the durability of the silane film in the corrosive medium; and that has more chemical stability with the coating, when compared with the plasma silicon oxide and base material, which was distinctly discussed.

Magneto-ionic control of magnetism using a solid-state proton pump	NATURE MATERIALS			English	Article							ELECTRIC-FIELD CONTROL; PALLADIUM; FILMS; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; FERROMAGNETISM; CONDUCTIVITY; SPECTROSCOPY; ELECTROLYSIS; WATER; EDGE	Voltage-gated ion transport as a means of manipulating magnetism electrically could enable ultralow-power memory, logic and sensor technologies. Earlier work made use of electric-field-driven O2- displacement to modulate magnetism in thin films by controlling interfacial or bulk oxidation states. However, elevated temperatures are required and chemical and structural changes lead to irreversibility and device degradation. Here we show reversible and non-destructive toggling of magnetic anisotropy at room temperature using a small gate voltage through H+ pumping in all-solid-state heterostructures. We achieve 90 degrees magnetization switching by H+ insertion at a Co/GdOx interface, with no degradation in magnetic properties after >2,000 cycles. We then demonstrate reversible anisotropy gating by hydrogen loading in Pd/Co/Pd heterostructures, making metal-metal interfaces susceptible to voltage control. The hydrogen storage metals Pd and Pt are high spin-orbit coupling materials commonly used to generate perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and spin-orbit torques in ferromagnet/heavy-metal heterostructures. Thus, our work provides a platform for voltage-controlled spin-orbitronics.	[Tan, Aik Jun; Huang, Mantao; Avci, Can Onur; Buttner, Felix; Mann, Maxwell; Tuller, Harry L.; Beach, Geoffrey S.

Electrochemical and structural characterization of a radical cation formed by one-electron oxidation of a cymantrene complex containing an N-heterocyclic carbene ligand	POLYHEDRON			English	Article						N-heterocyclic carbene; Cymantrene; Radical cation; Electrochemistry; Ligand donor strength	METAL-CARBONYL CATIONS; REDOX POTENTIALS; VIBRATIONAL FREQUENCIES; DFT; PARAMETRIZATION; PHOTOCHEMISTRY; APPROXIMATION; CHEMISTRY; EXCHANGE; DESIGN	Electrochemical oxidation of the cymantrene derivative MnCp(CO)(2)(IDiip). 1, (Cp = eta(5)-C5H5, IDiip = 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazole-2-ylidene) is a quasi-Nernstian one-electron process in dichloromethane/0.1 M INBu4][PF6]. The E-1/2 potential of the l(0/+) couple, -0.34 V vs. ferrocene, is the most negative yet reported for a mono-substituted cymantrene derivative, reflecting the powerful electron-donating character of the N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)IDiip ligand. The radical cation 1(+) has been characterized by IR spectroscopy (v(co) = 1958 and 2034 cm(-1)) and by X-ray crystallography as its [PF6](-) salt. Compared to its neutral counterpart MnCp'(CO)(2)(IDiip) (Cp' = eta(5)-C5H4Me), the Mn-C-NHC bond distance in 1(+) is lengthened by 0.031 angstrom and the average M-C(O) bond distances are lengthened by 0.069 angstrom. DFT-based computational results show that the largest contribution to the redox orbital of 1(0/)(+) is found at the metal atom (about 70% manganese-based in 1(+)). Comparison of the E-1/2 potential of 1 with those of other mono-CO-substituted cymantene complexes allows an estimate of the "ligand electronic parameter" of the IDiip ligand as -0.27 V vs. NHE.

A common method is to link the molecule to Au electrodes via a linker (e.g., thiol terminal of the molecule). Here we study the mechanical stability and electronic coupling of a S-Au bond in single-molecule junctions over a broad range of electrode potentials. Our results show that the mechanical and electromechanical properties of molecule-electrode contact undergo a systematic change with the potential involving Au oxidation at positive potentials and S protonation at negative potentials. The study establishes the potential range for a stable S-Au bond and determines the potential dependence of the mechanical and electromechanical properties of the molecule-electrode contact, which is crucial to the interpretation of potential-dependent charge transfer in electrochemistry and electrochemical gating of charge transport in molecular electronics.

Detection of Silver Nanoparticles by Electrochemically Activated Galvanic Exchange	LANGMUIR			English	Article							REPLACEMENT REACTION; GOLD NANOPARTICLES; FACILE SYNTHESIS; AG NANOCUBES; NANOCAGES; DNA; MONOLAYER; DEVICE; METALLOIMMUNOASSAY; ELECTROCATALYSTS	Here we report on the seemingly simple process of galvanic exchange (GE) between electrogenerated AuCl4- and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The results were obtained in the specific context of using AgNPs as labels for bioassays in paper fluidic devices. Results obtained from a combined electrochemistry and microscopy study indicate that the GE process results in recovery of only similar to 5% of the total equivalents of Ag present in the system. This low value is a consequence of two factors. First, after an initial fraction of each AgNP undergoes GE, a Au shell forms around the remaining AgNP core preventing further exchange. Second, to simulate a true biological fluid, the experiments were carried out in a Cl- containing buffer. Consequently, some Ag+ formed during GE precipitates as AgCl, and it also serves to block additional GE. Following optimization of the GE process, it was possible to detect AgNP label concentrations as low as 2.6 fM despite these limitations.

Electrochemical Dimerization of Phenylpropenoids and the Surprising Antioxidant Activity of the Resultant Quinone Methide Dimers	ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION			English	Article						antioxidants; electrochemistry; phenylpropenoids; quinone methides; resveratrol	NATURAL-PRODUCTS; HOPEAHAINOL; CHEMISTRY; OXIDATION	A simple method for the dimerization of phenylpropenoid derivatives is reported. It leverages electrochemical oxidation of p-unsaturated phenols to access the dimeric materials in a biomimetic fashion. The mild nature of the transformation provides excellent functional group tolerance, resulting in a unified approach for the synthesis of a range of natural products and related analogues with excellent regiocontrol. The operational simplicity of the method allows for greater efficiency in the synthesis of complex natural products. Interestingly, the quinone methide dimer intermediates are potent radical-trapping antioxidants; more so than the phenols from which they are derived - or transformed to - despite the fact that they do not possess a labile H-atom for transfer to the peroxyl radicals that propagate autoxidation.

In many ways, however, it proved to be a challenging and elusive case, also because of the difficulties in solving its structure by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. We used very short thiols and could prepare Au-144(SC2H5)(60) and Au-144(SC3H7)(60) in a very pure form, which was confirmed by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and very regular electrochemistry patterns. Inductively coupled plasma and electrospray ionization mass spectrometries gave definite proof of the Au-144(SR)(60) stoichiometry. High-resolution 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy in the solution phase provided the result of assessing the presence of 12 ligand types in exactly the same amount (5-fold equivalence). Equally important, we found that the two protons belonging to each methylene group along the thiolate chain are diastereotopic. For the -CH2 protons, the diastereotopic effect can be indeed gigantic, as it reaches chemical-shift differences of 2.9 ppm. DFT calculations provided insights into the relationship between structure and NMR results. In particular, the 12 ligand types and corresponding diastereotopic effects may be explained by considering the presence of C-HS hydrogen bonds. These results thus provide fundamental insights into the structure of the thiolate layer capping this long-studied gold nanocluster.

Here, we have carefully designed three dimensional (3D) interconnected porous electrode structures and performed experiments to probe how the ion and electron transport is impacted within these controlled geometries. By using anodized aluminum oxide as a template, we were able to fabricate both 1D array electrodes and 3D electrodes with varying numbers of interconnections, utilizing vanadium oxide (V2O5) as the active material. We demonstrate that the inherent properties of the electrode material in combination with the structural properties of the electrodes can both positively and negatively impact electrochemical characteristics. Most notably, electrodes with seven interconnecting layers in their structure had 19.7% less capacity at 25C than electrodes with zero interconnecting layers, demonstrating the negative effect of interconnections combined with poor electronic conductivity of V2O5 upon lithiation beyond one Li insertion. These results indicate that a careful consideration of the material and structural properties is needed for the design of high performance battery systems.

The electron rate transfer capabilities of Pt, Pd, Ru, Pt-Pd and Pt-Ru decorated r-GO were tested in ferri-ferro coupling reaction. Excellent electrochemical behaviour were observed in their ability to oxidize hydrazine, reduce H2O2, as well as oxygen reduction in alkaline medium and hydrogen evolution in acidic medium. These reactions represent diverse applications in energy production, storage, electrochemical sensing and electro catalysis, thus the method presented here can be quite useful in diverse applications.

Model Formulation and a Perturbation Solution for Low-Scan-Rate, Linear-Sweep Voltammetry of a Spinel Lithium Manganese Oxide Electrode	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							JAHN-TELLER DISTORTION; LI-ION CELLS; LIMN2O4; DIFFUSION; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; TEMPERATURE; SUPPRESSION; MECHANISM; FRACTURE; DIOXIDE	We formulate and implement a porous electrode model that includes multiple lithium-insertion species and associated electrochemical and homogenous reactions. This multi-species, multi-reaction (MSMR) model can account for the multiple current peaks observed in voltammetry data at slow scan rates and is also consistent with X-ray diffraction analysis of several different electrode materials. The MSMR model is used to simulate linear-sweep voltammetry data of a porous electrode of spinel lithium manganese oxide at different scan rates, and an analytic solution to these equations at very slow scan rates is given, based on a perturbation analysis. The greatest sensitivity at these slow scan rates is to the thermodynamic parameters, because the electrode is close to a state of dynamic equilibrium. The poor sensitivity to transport parameters means that it is not possible to distinguish between transport effects and a small amount of hysteresis that could be present in the slow-scan voltage measurements. These facts are illustrated using both the analytic solution and its comparison to numerical calculations. In Part 2, the analytic solution will be combined with numerical simulations at higher scan rates to complete the fitting process of transport, kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, along with a small amount of hysteresis.

The potential of the closely spaced 1,7-dipyrene fragments to promote formation of noncovalent pi-complexes with nanocarbon materials (C-60, C-70, (6,5)-single-walled carbon nanotube, and graphene) was explored. UV-vis, steady-state fluorescent, and time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy data indicated that the interaction between the new pyrene-aza-BODIPYs and C-60 or C-70 fullerenes in solution is weak, and time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy provided no evidence of photoinduced electron transfer. X-ray crystallography on a binary solid of aza-BODIPYs 5b and C-60 was indicative of a pyrene pyrene rather than pyrene C-60 interaction motif, whereas fullerenes were found to form close contacts with the electron-rich B,O-chelated part of aza-BODIPY 5b. In contrast, pyrene pyrene and pyrene C-60 but not aza-BODIPY-C-60 interactions were observed in the crystal structure of aza-BODIPY 5d and C-60. Density functional theory (DFT) and time dependent DFT calculations were used to support conclusions based on experimental data and are suggestive of rather weak interaction energies between 1,7-dipyrene-aza-BODIPYs and nanocarbon materials. Direct comparison with an analogous control compound lacking the pyrene ligands demonstrated that the pyrene substituents were ineffective at promoting and directing complex formation with nanocarbon materials. A common measurement of complex formation, emission loss in the presence of a nanocarbon acceptor, was demonstrated to have an alternative explanation in these systems, and the general effectiveness of using pyrene ligands to build noncovalent complexes was drawn into question.

Substrate Binding Regulates Redox Signaling in Human DNA Primase	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							IRON-SULFUR CLUSTERS; ENDONUCLEASE-III; REPAIR PROTEINS; 4FE4S CLUSTER; P58 SUBUNIT; POL ALPHA; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; POLYMERASE; INITIATION; INSIGHTS	Generation of daughter strands during DNA replication requires the action of DNA primase to synthesize an initial short RNA primer on the single-stranded DNA template. Primase is a heterodimeric enzyme containing two domains whose activity must be coordinated during primer synthesis: an RNA polymerase domain in the small subunit (p48) and a [4Fe4S] cluster-containing C-terminal domain of the large subunit (p58C). Here we examine the redox switching properties of the [4Fe4S] cluster in the full p48/p58 heterodimer using DNA electrochemistry. Unlike with isolated p58C, robust redox signaling in the primase heterodimer requires binding of both DNA and NTPs; NTP binding shifts the p48/p58 cluster redox potential into the physiological range, generating a signal near 160 mV vs NHE. Preloading of primase with NTPs enhances catalytic activity on primed DNA, suggesting that primase configurations promoting activity are more highly populated in the NTP-bound protein. We propose that p48/p58 binding of anionic DNA and NTPs affects the redox properties of the [4Fe4S] cluster; this electrostatic change is likely influenced by the alignment of primase subunits during activity because the configuration affects the [4Fe4S] cluster environment and coupling to DNA bases for redox signaling. Thus, both binding of polyanionic substrates and configurational dynamics appear to influence [4Fe4S] redox signaling properties. These results suggest that these factors should be considered generally in characterizing signaling networks of large, multisubunit DNA-processing [4Fe4S] enzymes.

Mechanistic proposals are guided by the characterization of reaction intermediates such as the S-2 state, which features two characteristic EPR signals at g = 2 and g = 4.1. Two nearly isoenergetic structural isomers have been proposed as the source of these distinct signals, but relevant structure electronic structure studies remain rare. Herein, we report the synthesis, crystal structure, electrochemistry, XAS, magnetic susceptibility, variable temperature CW-EPR, and pulse EPR data for a series of [(MnMn3O4)-Mn-III-O-IV] cuboidal complexes as spectroscopic models of the S-2 state of the OEC. Resembling the oxidation state and EPR spectra of the S-2 state of the OEC, these model complexes show two EPR signals, a broad low field signal and a multiline signal, that are remarkably similar to the biological system. The effect of systematic changes in the nature of the bridging ligands on spectroscopy were studied. Results show that the electronic structure of tetranuclear Mn complexes is highly sensitive to even small geometric changes and the nature of the bridging ligands. Our model studies suggest that the spectroscopic properties of the OEC may also react very sensitively to small changes in structure; the effect of protonation state and other reorganization processes need to be carefully assessed.

Pulse Dynamics of Electric Double Layer Formation on All-Solid-State Graphene Field-Effect Transistors	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						electric double layer; field-effect transistor; EDLT; molecular dynamics; graphene; solid polymer electrolyte; ion transport; iontronics	POLY(ETHYLENE OXIDE) LICLO4; IONIC-CONDUCTIVITY; THIN-FILM; ROOM-TEMPERATURE; GATE DIELECTRICS; ELECTROLYTES; PLASTICIZERS; TRANSPORT	Electric double layer (EDL) dynamics in graphene field-effect transistors (FETs) gated with polyethylene oxide (PEO)-based electrolytes are studied by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations from picoseconds to nanoseconds and experimentally from microseconds to milliseconds. Under an applied field of approximately mV/nm, EDL formation on graphene FETs gated with PEO:CsClO4 occurs on the timescale of microseconds at room temperature and strengthens within 1 ms to a sheet carrier density of n(s) approximate to 10(13) cm(-2). Stronger EDLs (i.e., larger n(s)) are induced experimentally by pulsing with applied voltages exceeding the electrochemical window of the electrolyte; electrochemistry is avoided using short pulses of a few milliseconds. Dynamics on picosecond to nanosecond timescales are accessed using MD simulations of PEO:LiClO4 between graphene electrodes with field strengths of hundreds of mV/nm which is 100x larger than experiment. At 100 mV/nm, EDL formation initiates in sub-nanoseconds achieving charge densities up to 6 x 10(13) cm(-2) within 3 nanoseconds. The modeling shows that under sufficiently high electric fields, EDLs with densities similar to 10(13) cm(-2) can form within a nanosecond, which is a timescale relevant for high-performance electronics such as EDL transistors (EDLTs). Moreover, the combination of experiment and modeling shows that the timescale for EDL formation (n(s) = 10(13) to 10(14) cm(-2)) can be tuned by 9 orders of magnitude by adjusting the field strength by only 3 orders of magnitude.

At present, such batteries are limited to operation at high temperatures because suitable fluoride ion-conducting electrolytes are known only in the solid state. We report a liquid fluoride ion-conducting electrolyte with high ionic conductivity, wide operating voltage, and robust chemical stability based on dry tetraalkylammonium fluoride salts in ether solvents. Pairing this liquid electrolyte with a copper-lanthanum trifluoride (Cu@LaF3) core-shell cathode, we demonstrate reversible fluorination and defluorination reactions in a fluoride ion electrochemical cell cycled at room temperature. Fluoride ion-mediated electrochemistry offers a pathway toward developing capacities beyond that of lithium ion technology.

Relationships between Molecular Structure, Interfacial Structure, and Dynamics of Ionic Liquids near Neutral and Charged Surfaces	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							ATOMIC-FORCE MICROSCOPY; ALKYL CHAIN-LENGTH; DOUBLE-LAYER; DIFFERENTIAL CAPACITANCE	Room-temperature ionic liquids are being researched for a variety of applications ranging from electrochemistry, energy storage, to lubrication. In many applications with ionic liquids, key processes occur near surfaces but the impact of the complex interfacial structure of ionic liquids on its interfacial dynamics is unclear. This work uses molecular dynamics simulations to show (1) how the molecular structures of ionic liquids can affect its interfacial structure and (2) the impact of these interfacial structures on the dynamics of ionic liquids near neutral and charged surfaces. When the cation and anion molecules are small and similar in size (e.g., 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide), laterally ordered structures form near neutral surfaces and the molecules have much lower diffusivities than that in the bulk. When the surfaces become charged, an order-to-disorder transition in the lateral structure increases the diffusivities. The presence of a long nonpolar tail (e.g., 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide and 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bis-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) causes the ionic liquid to be disordered near the neutral surfaces, and the molecules near the surfaces have diffusivities only slightly lower than that in the bulk. When the surfaces become charged, there is little change in the diffusivities for the systems with long nonpolar tails.	[Gil, Phwey S.; Jorgenson, Sara J.; Riet, Adriaan R.; Lacks, D.

This new combination was utilized to study the electrochemical proximity assay (ECPA)-a recently developed protein recognition strategy for the point-of-care test. The SPR/fluorescence spectroelectrochemical technique has achieved not only recognition of binding components involved in the ECPA model system, estimation of their thicknesses and surface coverages, but more importantly, highly reliable in situ monitoring of dynamic changes of components involved in interfacial binding via cross-validation and confirmation from three simultaneously generated signals-SPR, fluorescence, and electrochemistry. In addition, the obtained corresponding proportions among magnitudes of three signals provide crucial information for future studies on simultaneous characterization of multiple components in one step and differentiation of nonspecific binding events. Another advantage using this technique is that the excitation of fluorescence is not only confined by surface plasmons, but by photons, so the fluorescence information can be also gained as the distance of fluorophores from the surface exceeds the decay length of surface plasmons.

Synergistic Performance of Lithium Difluoro(oxalato)borate and Fluoroethylene Carbonate in Carbonate Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Anodes	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							VINYLENE CARBONATE; INTERPHASE; SEI; PRODUCT	There is significant interest in the development of rechargeable high-energy density batteries which utilize lithium metal anodes. Recently, fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) and lithium difluoro(oxalato) borate (LiDFOB) have been reported to significantly improve the electrochemical performance of lithium metal anodes. This investigation focuses on exploring the synergy between LiDFOB and FEC in carbonate electrolytes for lithium metal anodes. In ethylene carbonate (EC) electrolytes, LiDFOB is optimal when used in high salt concentrations, such as 1.0 M, to improve the electrochemistry of the lithium metal anode in Cu|| LiFePO4 cells. However, in FEC electrolytes, LiDFOB is optimal when used in lower concentrations, such as 0.05-0.10 M. From surface analysis, LiDFOB is observed to favorably react on the surface of lithium metal to improve the performance of the lithium metal anode, in both EC and FEC-based electrolytes. This research demonstrates progress toward developing feasible high-energy density lithium-based batteries. (c) The Author(s) 2018. Published by ECS.

J	Gross, MM; Manthiram, A				Gross, Martha M.; Manthiram, Arumugam			Aqueous Polysulfide-Air Battery with a Mediator-Ion Solid Electrolyte and a Copper Sulfide Catalyst for Polysulfide Redox	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						polysulfide-air batteries; copper sulfide catalyst; electrochemistry; catalyst stability; cycle life	FLOW BATTERY; GRAPHENE OXIDE; STORAGE; SCALE; MICROSPHERES; CROSSOVER; PROGRESS; ANODE	Aqueous sodium polysulfide air batteries are a promising system for enabling low-cost, high energy density, environmentally benign batteries for grid-scale deployment. However, the sluggish redox kinetics of aqueous polysulfide requires the use of a catalyst. Cobalt sulfide is a traditional catalyst with good activity and stability, but it uses expensive and toxic cobalt. This study demonstrates for the first time the long-term cycling performance of a sodium polysulfide air battery with a low-cost copper sulfide catalyst for polysulfide redox. Alkaline sodium polysulfide anolyte is paired with an acidic sodium phosphate buffered air catholyte by means of a Na+-ion solid-state electrolyte, which eliminates chemical crossover between the two electrodes while serving as a mediator-ion solid electrolyte. Long-term cycling is achieved by means of a decoupled charge and discharge air electrode. Furthermore, the effect of CuS redox activity in the polysulfide air voltage window is tested by pre-discharging CuS in LiOH and in NaOH. It was found that the sodium polysulfide air batteries with CuS catalyst exhibit good cycling performance, with the overpotential only showing a modest increase of 0.09 V after 100 cycles. Batteries assembled with CuS pre-discharged in LiOH exhibit a small boost in performance, while batteries assembled with CuS pre-discharged in NaOH show a small performance decline.

The efficiency of EC dehalogenation of DBPs increases with the number of halogen atoms in an individual DBP species. EC reductive cleavage of bromine from parent DBPs is faster than that of chlorine. EC data and quantum chemical modeling indicate that the EC reduction of iodine-containing DBPs (I-DBPs) is characterized by the formation of active iodine that reacts with the organic substrate. The occurrence of ICMs has attracted attention due to their association with the generation of I-DBPs. Indirect EC oxidation of ICMs using anodes that produce reactive oxygen species can result in a complete degradation of these compounds yet I-DBPs are formed in the process. Reductive EC deiodination of ICMs is rapid and its overall rate is diffusion-controlled yet I-DBPs are also produced in this reaction. Further progress in practically feasible EC methods to remove DBPs, ICMs and other trace-level organic contaminants requires the development of novel electrocatalytic materials, elimination of mass transfer limitations via innovative design of 3D electrodes and EC reactors, and further progress in the understanding of intrinsic mechanisms of EC reactions of DBPs and TrOC at EC interfaces.

Reactor design and integration with product detection to accelerate screening of electrocatalysts for carbon dioxide reduction	REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS			English	Article							SELECTIVE ELECTROCHEMICAL REDUCTION; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; CO2 REDUCTION; ELECTRODES; COMBINATORIAL; LIBRARIES; SYSTEM; DEMS; CELL; CU	Identifying new catalyst materials for complex reactions such as the electrochemical reduction of CO2 poses substantial instrumentation challenges due to the need to integrate reactor control with electrochemical and analytical instrumentation. Performing accelerated screening to enable exploration of a broad span of catalyst materials poses additional challenges due to the long time scales associated with accumulation of reaction products and the detection of the reaction products with traditional separation-based analytical methods. The catalyst screening techniques that have been reported for combinatorial studies of (photo)electrocatalysts do not meet the needs of CO2 reduction catalyst research, prompting our development of a new electrochemical cell design and its integration to gas and liquid chromatography instruments. To enable rapid chromatography measurements while maintaining sensitivity to minor products, the electrochemical cell features low electrolyte and head space volumes compared to the catalyst surface area. Additionally, the cell is operated as a batch reactor with electrolyte recirculation to rapidly concentrate reaction products, which serves the present needs for rapidly detecting minor products and has additional implications for enabling product separations in industrial CO2 electrolysis systems. To maintain near-saturation of CO2 in aqueous electrolytes, we employ electrolyte nebulization through a CO2-rich headspace, achieving similar gas-liquid equilibration as vigorous CO2 bubbling but without gas flow. The instrument is demonstrated with a series of electrochemical experiments on an Au-Pd combinatorial library, revealing non-monotonic variations in product distribution with respect to catalyst composition. The highly integrated analytical electrochemistry system is engineered to enable automation for rapid catalyst screening as well as deployment for a broad range of electrochemical reactions where product distribution is critical to the assessment of catalyst performance.

These nanopore electrode array (NEA) structures exhibit distinctive electrochemical behaviors not observed in open NEAs, which allow free diffusion of redox couples between the nanopore interior and bulk solution. Confined nanopore environments, generated by sealing NEAs with a layer of poly(dimethylsiloxane), are characterized by enhanced currents-up to 250-fold compared with open NEAs-owing to effective trapping of the redox couple inside the nanopores and to enhanced mass transport effects. In addition, electrochemical rectification (ca. 1.5-6.3) was observed and is attributed to ion migration. Finite-element simulations were performed to characterize the concentration and electric potential gradients associated with the disk electrode, aqueous medium, and ring electrode inside the nanopores, and the results are consistent with experimental observations. The additional signal enhancement and redox-cycling-based rectification behaviors produced in these self-confined attoliter-volume nanopores are potentially useful in devising ultrasensitive sensors and molecular-based iontronic devices.

Note that nanocellulose accounts for nearly 40% of wood's weight and can be extracted using well-developed methods. Due to its appealing mechanical and electrochemical properties, including high specific modulus (similar to 100 GPa/(g/cm(3))), excellent stability in most solvents, and stability over a wide electrochemical window, nanocellulose has been widely used as a separator, electrolyte, binder, and substrate material for energy storage. Additionally, nano cellulose -derived carbon materials have also drawn increasing scientific interest in sustainable energy storage due to their low-cost and raw-material abundance, high conductivity, and rational electrochemical performance. The inexpensive and environmentally friendly nature of nanocellulose and its derivatives as well as simple fabrication techniques make nanocellulose-based energy storage devices promising candidates for the future of "green" and renewable electronics. For nanocellulose-based energy storage, structure engineering and design play a vital role in achieving desired electrochemical properties and performances. Thus, it is important to identify suitable structure and design engineering strategies and to better understand their relationship. In this Account, we review recent developments in nanocellulose-based energy storage. Due to the limited space, we will mainly focus on structure design and engineering strategies in macrofiber, paper, and three-dimensional (3D) structured electrochemical energy storage (EES) devices and highlight progress made in our group. We first present the structure and properties of nanocellulose, with a particular discussion of nanocellulose from wood materials. We then go on to discuss studies on nanocellulose-based macrofiber, paper, and 3D wood-and other aerogel-based EES devices. Within this discussion, we highlight the use of natural nanocellulose as a flexible substrate for a macrofiber supercapacitor and an excellent electrolyte reservoir for a breathable textile lithium oxygen battery. Paper batteries and supercapacitors using nanocellulose as a green dispersant, nanocellulose-based paper as a flexible substrate, and nanocellulose as separator and electrolyte are also examined. We highlight recent progress on wood-based batteries and supercapacitors, focusing on the advantages of wood materials for energy storage, the structure design and engineering strategies, and their microstructure and electrochemical properties. We discuss the influence of structure (particularly pores) on the electrochemical performance of the energy storage devices. By taking advantage of the straight, nature-made channels in wood materials, ultrathick, highly loaded, and low-tortuosity energy storage devices are demonstrated. Finally, we offer concluding remarks on the challenges and directions of future research in the field of nanocellulose-based energy storage devices.

Concurrent measurements of neurochemical and electrophysiological activity with microelectrode arrays: New perspectives for constant potential amperometry	CURRENT OPINION IN ELECTROCHEMISTRY			English	Review							IN-VIVO; BRAIN-SLICES; GLUTAMATE; RELEASE; BIOSENSOR; DOPAMINE; PLATINUM; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; ACETYLCHOLINE; IONTOPHORESIS	Our current understanding of neurotransmission and neuromodulation stands to gain from concurrent electrochemical and electrophysiological measurements, which have been attempted since the introduction of in vivo electrochemical techniques. Dual in vivo recordings have evolved from parallel approaches using two distinct microelectrodes towards serial strategies encompassing "time-sharing" between two independent recording systems while using a single microelectrode. More recently, fast sampling amperometry has been demonstrated to allow concurrent measurement of rapid neurochemical and electrophysiological events using a single sensor and recording system. This is supported by the fact that the high-frequency component of an amperometric recording (>1 Hz) resembles the local field potential while the low frequency component (<1 Hz) reflects the electrochemical signal resulting from the oxidation or reduction of electroactive species present in the milieu. This opens new avenues for constant potential amperometry, widening the application of this seamless electrochemical technique.

In this constructed architecture, the F-doped carbon surface modification layers can not only enhance the electronic conductivity of the overall electrode but also avoid the direct exposure of LNMCO to the electrolyte. As a result, The LMCNO@C-F sample exhibits a high reversible capacity (289.5 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C), excellent rate capability (263.6, 218.9, 182.9, and 108.6 mA h g(-1) at 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 C, respectively), and superior cycling stability (with a high capacity retention of 88.5% at 5 C after 500 cycles). The enhanced performance is ascribed to the formed metal fluorides (Mn-F bond) and a strong electronic coupling between F-doped carbon and bulk LMNCO, which can greatly enhance the structure stability and electronic conductivity of LMNCO cathode materials.

Herein, we report a sustainable route direct from low-cost metal oxides/carbon (MOs/C) powders to metal carbides (MCs) and then to porous carbide derived carbons (CDCs). With the assistance of a solid oxide membrane (SOM), Cr7C3 and Cr2AlC have been first synthesized from Cr2O3/C and Cr2O3/Al2O3/C powder mixtures, respectively. The synthesis pathway typically comprises electrochemical compounding, electrochemical reduction, and in situ carbonization processes. The Cr7C3 and Cr2AlC with similar homogeneous nodular structure have been further in situ electrochemically converted into porous CDC materials. The as-prepared CDCs with amorphous and graphitic structures are hierarchical meso-/macroporous carbon materials. Besides, the CDCs as an anode for lithium ion batteries were evaluated for their electrochemical performance. The results show that the discharge capacity of Cr2AlC-CDC can stay at 248 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 100 mA g(-1), demonstrating stable cyclic performance. The molten-salt electrochemical reduction-etching process provides a new method for synthesizing various CDC materials.

Preparation and characterization of Grafoil/Ni and polyaniline/Ni composites from the controlled electrochemical reduction of NiCl42-	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Polyaniline; Ni; Composite; Catalysis; Alkaline	CARBON MODIFIED ELECTRODE; TRANSITION-METAL SALTS; ELECTROCATALYTIC OXIDATION; ALKALINE-SOLUTION; CONDUCTING POLYMERS; METHANOL OXIDATION; INFRARED-SPECTRA; IN-SITU; NICKEL; COMPLEXES	The controlled reduction of a nickel metal anion, NiCl42-, at a carbon (Grafoil) and Polyaniline (PANI) electrode is explored. The incremental increase of Ni deposits is achieved from the reduction of the metal precursor at both electrodes. The normal oxidation/reduction was used to facilitate the uptake and dispersion of the precursor using electrostatic interactions with the positively charged PANI. The controlled in-situ reduction of the dispersed Ni precursor in the polymer was utilized to produce PANI/Ni composites with variable metal content. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis and energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectroscopy of both substrates confirm the reduction of the Ni metal precursor at both electrodes. The chemical reactivity of the Ni metal deposited was also confirmed for both substrates using surface specific electrochemical reactions including the formation/reduction of oxidized nickel species and the catalytic oxidation of methanol in alkaline solutions (pH approximate to 14). The electrochemistry associated with NiOOH/Ni(OH)(2) and the catalytic oxidation of methanol is resolved in alkaline solution for both electrodes. Furthermore, the electrochemical activity of PANI/Ni composite materials is maintained without acid doping the polymer. Finally, an alternative pathway for the inclusion of anionic transition metal species in PANI that eliminates the competitive uptake of proton and metal cation precursors commonly used in traditional acidic environments is demonstrated.

Effects of jet rate on cross-sectional composition distribution, microstructure, microhardness, and corrosion properties of the obtained nanocomposites were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), microhardness testing, and electrochemistry. Results revealed the presence of high concentrations of Ni (54.7 at. %) and Ti (17.6 at. %) particles across throughout the thickness of composites prepared at 3 m/s. Nanocomposites prepared at 3 m/s exhibited uniform and smooth morphologies, with exiguous grains and an arithmetic mean roughness (R-a) of similar to 23.61 nm. Also, nanocomposites prepared at 3 m/s showed smaller nickel grains than those obtained at 1 and 5 m/s. I-corr and E-corr of Ni-TiN nanocomposites formed at 3 m/s were respectively minimum at 2.093 x 10(-2) mA/cm(2) and -0.462 V, confirming higher corrosion resistance. The microhardness values of Ni-TiN nanocomposites prepared at jet rates of 1, 3, and 5 m/s were respectively maximum at 751.5, 862.8, and 814.2 HV, respectively.

High-Resolution Nanoprinting Approach through Self-Driven Electrodeposition	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							SEMICONDUCTOR	A novel high-resolution nanoprinting method through self-driven electrodeposition is proposed and certain aspects are confirmed with known copper electrochemistry through multiphysics modeling. A series of simulations are conducted involving a nanopipette filled with concentrated CuSO4 solution introduced close to the working electrode (WE) in the cell of diluted CuSO4 electrolyte, where Cu2+ ions diffuse from nanopipette to the electrode and form a limited region with more concentrated cations compared to the rest of the cell. Meanwhile, this process leads to a more positive equilibrium potential of copper redox reaction and thereby local negative surface overpotential on WE. The negative surface overpotential drives the Cu2+ electrodeposition in the form of a nano-protrusion on the target location. (C) The Author(s) 2018. Published by ECS.

Activation of Reduced-Graphene-Oxide Supported Pt Nanoparticles by Aligning with WO3-Nanowires toward Oxygen Reduction in Acid Medium: Diagnosis with Rotating-Ring-Disk Voltammetry and Double-Potential-Step Chronocoulometry	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Meeting of the Society	MAY 13-17, 2018	Seattle, WA				ANION-EXCHANGE MEMBRANES; POLYMER ELECTROLYTE; RECENT ADVANCEMENTS; DOPED GRAPHENE; FREE CATALYSTS; ELECTROCATALYSTS; CARBON; ALLOY; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; ELECTROREDUCTION	The chemically-reduced graphene-oxide has been used as support to anchor catalytic Pt nanoparticles and, while subsequently modified with tungsten oxide nanowires, has produced a hybrid electrocatalytic system for electroreduction of oxygen in acid medium. Such characteristics of reduced graphene oxide as defective surface and low degree of organization of graphitic structures facilitate dispersion of platinum nanocenters. Further combination with WO3 nanonowires is expected to increase the system's interfacial hydrophilicity and porosity. Most likely WO3 nanostructures are attached mainly to the edges of graphene thus preventing its stacking and creating space for the flux of oxygen and the reaction products. The results of electrochemical diagnostic experiments are consistent with the view that the electrocatalytic activity of the system utilizing tungsten oxide nanowires toward the reduction of oxygen in acid medium has been enhanced even at the Pt loading as low as 30 mu g cm(-2). Furthermore, the rotating ring-disk electrode voltammetry data is consistent with decreased formation of the undesirable hydrogen peroxide intermediate in the presence of WO3. The conclusions are supported with mechanistic and kinetic studies performed with use of double-potential-step chronocoulometry as an alternative diagnostic tool to rotating ring-disk voltammetry.

Here, we focus on the experimental implementation of XPEEM to probe electrified graphene-liquid interfaces using electrolyte-filled microchannel arrays as a new sample platform. We demonstrate the important methodological advantage of these multi-sample arrays: they combine the wide field of view hyperspectral imaging capabilities from XPEEM with the use of powerful data mining algorithms to reveal spectroscopic and temporal behaviors at the level of the individual microsample or the entire array ensemble.

Conventional analytical methods for selective in vivo monitoring of AA mainly involve complex procedures, which lower the temporal resolution and throughput of data gathering. Moreover, analytical methods for selective real-time monitoring of AA exocytosis at a single-cell level is still lacking. The lack of effective methods for AA detection in the central nervous system (CNS) has rendered difficulties in better understanding the roles of AA in brain function. AA is, in itself, electrochemically active, and thereby rationally tailoring the structure of an electrode/solution interface would offer an effective approach to selective electrochemical measurements in the CNS. Guided by this, electrochemical methods have been recently established for AA detection by combining selective electrochemical oxidation of AA at functionalized electrodes with microelectrode techniques and with in vivo microdialysis. This review mainly focuses on recent updates on in vivo detection of AA by modulating the electron transfer of AA to achieve the selectivity for its detection in the CNS, an environment with high chemical complexity. Additionally, the practical implications of the methods in selective and sensitive monitoring the dynamics of AA in different brain functions are also reviewed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Electrochemistry of zinc tetraarylporphyrins containing fused butano and benzo groups. Effect of solvent and substituents on spectra, potentials and mechanism in nonaqueous media	JOURNAL OF PORPHYRINS AND PHTHALOCYANINES			English	Article						synthesis; porphyrinoids; electrochemistry; spectroelectrochemistry; substituent effect	ELECTRON-TRANSFER; REDOX PROPERTIES; PORPHYRINS; CONSTRUCTION; BINDING	Two series of zinc tetraarylporphyrins containing four beta,beta'-pyrrole fused butano or benzo groups were synthesized and characterized as to their electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical properties in nonaqueous media. The examined compounds are represented as butano(Ar)(4)PorZn and benzo(Ar)(4)PorZn, where Por is the porphyrin dianion and Ar is a p-CH3Ph, Ph or p-ClPh substitutent on meso-positions of the macrocycle. Each Zn(II) butano- and benzoporphyrin undergoes two one-electron reductions to give a n-anion radical and dianion in CH2Cl2. In contrast, three reductions were observed for the benzoporphyrin derivatives in pyridine, the third of which is assigned as electron addition to a benzophlorin anion generated from the doubly reduced benzoporphyrin. Two overlapped one-electron oxidations were observed for the butanoporphyrins in CH2Cl2, a result not previously observed for any other zinc porphyrin. The electrochemically measured HOMO-LUMO gap of the benzoporphyrins ranges from 1.89 to 1.90 V in CH(2)Cl(2 )and from 1.93 to 1.95 V in pyridine. Both values are smaller than the gaps of butanoporphyrins at 2.11-2.13 V in CH2Cl2 and 2.07-2.09 V in pyridine.

J	Boyd, S; Dhall, R; LeBeau, JM; Augustyn, V				Boyd, Shelby; Dhall, Rohan; LeBeau, James M.; Augustyn, Veronica			Charge storage mechanism and degradation of P2-type sodium transition metal oxides in aqueous electrolytes	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							NA-ION BATTERIES; CATHODE MATERIAL; ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCE; POSITIVE ELECTRODE; CRYSTAL WATER; HIGH-CAPACITY; HIGH-VOLTAGE; STABILITY; PHASE; INTERCALATION	Fewtransitionmetal oxides exhibit sufficient stability for aqueous ion intercalation fromneutral pH electrolytes for low-cost aqueous Na+ batteries and battery-type desalinators. P2 layered Na+ manganese-rich oxides have high theoretical capacities and voltages for Na+ storage and are extensively investigated for nonaqueous Na+ batteries. However, the charge storage mechanism and factors controlling interlayer chemistry and redox behavior of these materials in aqueous electrolytes have not been determined. Here, we take a significant step in establishing their aqueous electrochemical behavior by investigating a series of P2 oxides that exhibit a range of stability in water and ambient air: Na0.62Ni0.22Mn0.66Fe0.10O2 (NaNMFe), Na0.61Ni0.22Mn0.66Co0.10O2 (NaNMCo), Na0.64Ni0.22Mn0.66Cu0.11O2 (NaNMCu), and Na0.64Mn0.62Cu0.31O2 (NaMCu). Depending on the transition metal composition and potential, all materials exhibit significant irreversible Na+ loss during the first anodic cycle followed by water intercalation into the interlayer. The presence of water causes conversion into birnessite-like phases and microscopic exfoliation of the particles. The interlayer affinity for water is primarily driven by the Na+ content, which can be tuned by the transition metal composition and the maximum anodic potential during electrochemical cycling. The interlayer water affects the reversible capacity and cycling stability of the oxides, with the highest reversible capacity (similar to 40 mA h g(-1) delivered in similar to 30 minutes) obtained with NaNMCo. These results present the first studies on the structural effects of aqueous electrochemistry in P2 oxides, highlight the significant differences in the electrochemical behavior of P2 oxides in aqueous vs. non-aqueous electrolytes, and provide guidance on how to use the transitionmetal chemistry to tune their aqueous charge storage behavior.

Water not only forms the solvation shell but also penetrates into the protein interior. Changing the wetting pattern of the protein's active site in response to altering redox state initiates a highly nonlinear structural change and non-Gaussian electrostatic fluctuations at the active site. The free-energy surfaces of electron transfer are highly nonparabolic (non-Marcusian), as shown by atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of hydrated ferredoxin protein and by an analytical model in agreement with simulations. The reorganization energy of electron transfer passes through a spike marking equal probabilities of the wet and dry states of the active site. The activation thermodynamics affected by wetting leads to a non-Arrhenius, passing through a maximum, plot for the reaction rate vs the inverse temperature.

Modifying the existing perovskite-based electrode surface to form a heterostructure has been widely applied for the rational design of novel electrodes with high performance. Despite many successful developments in enhancing electrode performance by surface modification, some controversial results are also reported in the literature and the mechanisms are still not well understood. In this work, the mechanism of how surface modification impacts the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability of perovskite-based oxides was investigated. We took La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF) as the thin-film model system and modified its surface with additive PrxCe1-xO2 layers of different thicknesses. We found a strong correlation between surface oxygen defects and the ORR activity of the heterostructure. By inducing higher oxygen vacancy concentration compared to bare LSCF, PrO2 coating is proved to greatly facilitate the rate of oxygen dissociation, thus significantly enhancing the ORR activity. Because of low oxygen vacancy density introduced by Pr0.2Ce0.8O2 and CeO2 coating, on the one hand, it does not boost the rate of ORR but successfully suppresses surface Sr segregation, leading to an enhanced durability. Our findings demonstrate the vital role of surface oxygen defects and provide important insights for the rational design of high-performance electrode materials through surface defect engineering.

The properties of these components jointly determine the safety, the lifetime, and the electrochemical performance. They also include, but are not limited to, the power density and the charge as well as the recharge time/rate associated with a battery system. An extensive amount of research is dedicated to understanding the physical and chemical properties associated with each of the four components aimed at developing new generations of battery systems with greatly enhanced safety and electrochemical performance at a significantly reduced cost for large scale applications. Advanced characterization tools are a prerequisite to fundamentally understanding battery materials. Considering that some of the key electrochemical processes can only exist under in situ conditions, which can only be captured under working battery conditions when electric wires are attached and current and voltage are applied, make in situ detection critical. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), a non-invasive and atomic specific tool, is capable of detecting all phases, including crystalline, amorphous, liquid and gaseous phases simultaneously and is ideal for in situ detection on a working battery system. Ex situ NMR on the other hand can provide more detailed molecular or structural information on stable species with better spectral resolution and sensitivity. The combination of in situ and ex situ NMR, thus, offers a powerful tool for investigating the detailed electrochemistry in batteries.

The reaction mechanism and the structure of the Li(2)MoO(2)S(2 )are probed by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, differential electrochemical mass spectrometry, and UV-visible spectroscopy. The results show that the MoS(2 )is oxidized during discharge and is recovered during charge. The iodine intermediates play an important role in triggering the sequence of electrochemical and chemical reactions in the cell. The Li2MoO2S2 is isostructural to the Li2MoO4 rather than adopting structures of other known molybdenum oxysulfides.

The versatility of the nanocomposite performance was corroborated by altering size and density of electrodeposited gold (Au-NP) and silver (Ag-NP) nanoparticles on the graphene oxide; GO, thermally reduced GO; rGO(th) and nitrogenated functionalized graphene; NFG. These noble metal nanoparticles are selected due to higher electrical conductivity, facile synthesis, processability and antimicrobial nature. The multilayers (PANi vertical bar Ag-NP vertical bar GFN and PANi vertical bar Au-NP vertical bar GFN) on fluoride-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass, graphite foil (GF) and graphene rod (GR) electrodes were tested that show increased electrical conductivity and reduced charge transfer resistance. We demonstrated ultrasensitive detection of AA analyte over full range (from 1 x 10(-12) M to 10 x 10(-3) M) with linear sensitivity 10 mA mM(-1) cm(-2) and excellent limit of detection < 1 pM having high signal-to-noise ratio following PANi vertical bar Au-NP vertical bar NFG <= PANi vertical bar Ag-NP vertical bar NFG < Au-NP vertical bar NFG < Ag-NP vertical bar NFG. Specificity of the biosensor is assessed by interfering species commonly found in blood serum i.e. glucose (Glu) and uric acid (UA). We attribute these findings to synergistically coupled metal nanoparticles and functionalized graphene promoted localized orbital re-hybridization and heterogeneously integration with PANi. These multilayer 'hybrid' nanocomposite electrodes are also useful for platinum-free electrocatalysis, pseudocapacitors and biofuel cell development.

Taking advantage of positively charged Ch film with -N+(CH3)(3) polar head groups, Au NCs-carbon nanotubes nanocomposite could be uniformly and compactly assembled onto electrode surface, and Au NCs were favorable for the functionalization of sensing interface because of their hollow interiors and porous walls. The proposed system displayed prominent electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of GMP due to the well distribution status, large electroactive area, as well as fast electron transfer kinetics of sensing interface. As a result, GMP was sensitively detected with a low detection limit of 0.1 mu M. Moreover, the sensing platform was applied in the assessment of GMP levels in oligonucleotides with satisfactory results. In contrast to the detection performances of other methods, the present work exhibited advantages of rapidity, low cost, and ease of operation, which may make the sensing system promising for potential applications in DNA assay and the fundamental research of interfacial electrochemistry.

Herein, selective two-electron reduction of O-2 to H2O2 by a single [Ni-II(H2O)(6)](2+) cation that is dynamically associated with a negatively charged metal-organic layer (MOL) by hydrogen bonding and coulombic interactions is reported. In contrast, Ni-II centers covalently immobilized on the MOL reduce O-2 to H2O in a four- electron process. Oxygen adsorption by [Ni-II(H2O)(6)](2+) followed by two-electron reduction generates neutral [Ni-II(H2O)(4)(OH)(OOH)](0), which momentarily disconnects from the negatively charged MOL to avoid the injection of additional electrons. Release of H2O2 from [Ni-II(H2O)(4)(OH)(OOH)](0) regenerates [Ni-II(H2O)(6)](2+), which regains affinity to the MOL. Such dynamically associated Ni-II single-metal electrocatalysts ensure high selectivity and represent a new strategy for generating selective catalysts for electrochemical production of important chemicals.

However, the inability to host a sufficient amount of sulfur in the cathode while maintaining good electrochemical stability under a lean electrolyte condition has limited the progress. The main cause of these challenges is the sensitivity of the sulfur cathode to the cell-design parameters (i.e., the amount of sulfur and electrolyte) and the experimental testing conditions (i.e., cycling rates and analysis duration). Here, a hot-pressing method is presented that effectively encapsulates a high amount of sulfur in the cathode within only 5 s, resulting in high sulfur loading and content of, respectively, 10 mg cm(-2) and 65 wt%. The hot-pressed sulfur (HPS) cathodes exhibit superior dynamic and static electrochemical performance under a broad cycling-rate (C/20-1C rates) and low electrolyte/sulfur ratio (6 mu L mg(-1)) conditions. The dynamic cell stability is demonstrated by high gravimetric and areal capacities of, respectively, 415-730 mAh g(-1) and 7-12 mAh cm(-2) at C/20-1C rates with a high capacity retention of over 70% after 200 cycles. The static cell stability is demonstrated by excellent shelf life with low self-discharge and stable cycle life on storing for over one year.

Pulsed Galvanostatic Electrodeposition of Copper on Cobalt Using a pH-Neutral Plating Bath and Electroless Seeds	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							DIFFUSION-CONTROLLED GROWTH; ELECTROCHEMICAL NUCLEATION; 3-DIMENSIONAL NUCLEATION; IONIZATION-POTENTIALS; POLARIZATION DATA; DEPOSITION RATE; REDUCING AGENT; TARTARIC ACID; ACTIVE-SITES; CU	Due to its notable retention of electrical conductivity in nanoscale features, cobalt is a leading material candidate for diffusion barriers in the sub-14 nm node copper interconnects. In this application, Co also facilitates high aspect ratio gap-filling by serving as a substrate for direct electrochemical deposition (ECD) of Cu. However, the Co-Cu ECD system is associated with several technical challenges, which include dissolution of Cu seeds (and Co) in conventional acidic baths, interference of hydrogen evolution, and solution-sensitive nucleation barriers. We investigate here this ECD system by using pulsed galvanostatic ECD in a neutral plating bath of CuSO4, with in situ electroless deposition of Cu seeds. Both seeding and ECD of Cu are enhanced with the use of a carbon based catalytic activator. These observations are explained in terms of a proposed mixed-potential mechanism. Nucleation of the ECD-Cu is detected with voltammetry, and further quantified as an instantaneous step by measuring the associated kinetic parameters with chronoamperometry. Spatially uniform layers of pulse-deposited Cu on Co are detected by electron microscopy, and the deposition rates are determined using energy dispersed X-Ray spectroscopy. Corrosion tests performed in a glycine-based solution for Cu planarization confirm the general CMP compatible electrochemistry of the ECD-Cu. (C) The Author(s) 2018. Published by ECS.	[Simpson, D.

Electrochemistry of the NaI-AlCl3 Molten Salt System for Use as Catholyte in Sodium Metal Batteries	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							ENERGY-STORAGE; SULFUR BATTERIES; OXIDE; NACL-ALCL3; NAI	Molten salt electrolytes show promise as safe, effective elements of emerging low to intermediate temperature molten sodium batteries. Here we investigate the NaI-AlCl3 molten salt system for its electrochemical and physical properties at 150 and 180. C, temperatures recently used to demonstrate a new NaI battery using this molten salt system. Molten salt compositions ranging from 20-75% NaI were prepared and electrochemically interrogated with carbon fiber ultramicroelectrodes utilizing cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and differential pulse voltammetry. Results indicate that at very high or very low NaI concentrations, secondary phases present hinder diffusion of the redox-active species, potentially impacting the current density of the system. Furthermore, a concentration-independent chronoamperometric analysis technique was leveraged to determine effective diffusion coefficients of active I- in the melt phase. Collectively, the physical characterization and electrochemical properties of the tested salts indicate that the catholyte composition can significantly affect the physical state, current density, ionic diffusion, and voltage window of these promising NaI-AlCl3 molten salt battery catholytes.

Adsorption of mixtures of the Yukawa-ions near a hard wall: A density functional study based on the third-order Ornstein-Zernike relation	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR LIQUIDS			English	Article							ELECTRICAL DOUBLE-LAYER; FREE-ENERGY MODEL; FLUID; SPHERES; NONUNIFORM; STATES	We examine the adsorption of the primitive-model "ionic" mixtures modeled in terms of the screened Debye potentials on a hard structureless wall. It is well-known that the screened Debye potentials are of the Yukawa form. They could approach the Coulomb potentials when the screen parameter lambda vanishes. Thus the study of the mixtures of repulsive and attractive Yukawa molecules can mimic the ionic fluid behavior at small lambda. One of the advantages of using this Yukawa potential is that it avoids the long-range interactions and mitigates the complications inherent in the Coulomb potential. We have previously developed a third-order Ornstein-Zernike relation (OZ3) and have adapted it to the adsorption of many types of fluids on hard walls. Specifically, a new generation of closures was developed for use in the Euler-Lagrange equations of the density functional theory (DFT) for determining the non-uniform densities of various fluid types: such as the Lennard-Jones fluid, as well as the regular Yukawa fluids (with finite lambda values) on an inhomogeneous substrate. In this work we examine the applicability of the OZ3-inspired bridge functions to the adsorption of the "small-lambda" Yukawa fluids. The mixtures of these Yukawa fluids are, for simplicity, called the Yukawa ions, in contrast to the Coulomb ions. The results shall mimic the electrical double layers in electrochemistry. The Euler-Lagrange equations for the binary mixtures are solved with new OZ3 closures. Two types of closures are investigated: one derived from the Jackson-Feenberg approximation, and the other derived from the linear cavity approximation. The results are compared with the Monte-Carlo results on primitive-model symmetric ions and asymmetric ions on a neutral hard structureless wall. Satisfactory agreements are obtained. It is noted that the contact value theorems (i.e. the hard-wall sum rules) play an instrumental role in obtaining the accurate results. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Role of disorder in limiting the true multi-electron redox in epsilon-LiVOPO4	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							POSITIVE-ELECTRODE MATERIALS; LITHIUM BATTERIES; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; CATHODE MATERIAL; LIVOPO4; VANADYL; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; EPSILON-VOPO4; PHOSPHATES; GENERATION	Recent advances in materials syntheses have enabled epsilon-LiVOPO4 to deliver capacities approaching, and in some cases exceeding the theoretical value of 305 mA h g(-1) for 2Li intercalation, despite its poor electronic and ionic conductivity. However, not all of the capacity corresponds to the true electrochemical intercalation/deintercalation reactions as evidenced upon systematic tracking of V valence through combined operando and rate-dependent ex situ X-ray absorption study presented herein. Structural disorder and defects introduced in the material by high-energy ball milling impede kinetics of the high-voltage V5+/V4+ redox more severely than the low-voltage V4+/V3+ redox, promoting significant side reaction contributions in the high-voltage region, irrespective of cycling conditions. The present work emphasizes the need for nanoengineering of active materials without compromising their bulk structural integrity in order to fully utilize high-energy density of multi-electron cathode materials.

Formic acid is widely used in MOFs with diverse coordination models, which can further regulate morphologies of the carbonized metal oxides. However, less work is reported on the fabrication of metal oxides with formic acid ligands and their application as electrode materials. Herein, utilizing the self-assembled MOFs [NH2(CH3)(2)][(FeFeII)-Fe-III(HCOO)(6)] with formic acid ligands as the precursor, a carbon decorated Fe3O4 is successfully prepared, consisting of Fe3O4 nanoparticles with diameters of 40-60 nm and the coated carbon that is stemmed from the organic precursor of formic acid. When used as the electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries, this composite exhibits good rate capability and stabilized reversible capacity of 1041 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles at 100 mA g(-1). These superior properties can be attributed to the synergetic effect of the unique nano/micro structure and uniform dispersion of the conductive carbon provided by this new MOF precursor.

Investigation of Conductivity and Ionic Transport of VO2(M) and VO2(R) via Electrochemical Study	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							RAY STRUCTURAL-CHARACTERIZATION; PHASE-TRANSITION; VANADIUM-OXIDES; AB-INITIO; INSULATOR-TRANSITION; MOTT TRANSITION; TIO2 001; STRAIN; DYNAMICS; KINETICS	Vanadium dioxides exist as a variety of polymorphs, each with differing structural and electrochemical capabilities. The monoclinic to rutile transition is an interesting system for study as the transition temperature is easily accessible at moderate temperature and corresponds to an increase in electrical conductivity by 2 orders of magnitude. The transition from monoclinic to rutile is characterized structurally herein using synchrotron -based X-ray diffraction and related to lithium-ion electrochemistry using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and intermittent pulsatile galvanostatic discharge tests. The experimental results indicate a decrease in ohmic resistance for lithium-based cells tested under higher temperatures. Complementary density functional theory calculations described the experimentally measured intercalation voltages and identified a possible Li- induced LixVO2(M) to LixVO2(R) phase transition during the discharging process rationalizing the favorable impact on the function of a lithium-based electrochemical cell. To our knowledge, this is the first observation of the metal insulator transition of VO2 in a full electrochemical cell.

Role of Surface States in Photocatalytic Oxygen Evolution with CuWO4 Particles	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							PHOTOELECTROCHEMICAL WATER OXIDATION; TUNGSTATE THIN-FILMS; VISIBLE-LIGHT; CHARGE SEPARATION; COPPER TUNGSTATE; Z-SCHEME; EFFICIENT; WO3; DRIVEN; PHOTOANODES	CuWO4 is a medium bandgap (2.3 eV) n-type semiconductor capable of photoelectrochemical water oxidation under applied electrical bias. Here, we show for the first time that suspended microcrystals CuWO4 evolve oxygen photocatalytically under visible illumination from solutions of 0.05 M AgNO3 (10.8 mu mol/hour; AQE of 0.56% at 400 nm) and 0.0002 M FeCl3 (1.5 mu mol/hour). No oxygen is detected with 0.002 M [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) as sacrificial agent. The activity dependence on the redox potential of the acceptors is due to the presence of Cu2+ based electron trap states in CuWO4. According to surface photovoltage spectroscopy and electrochemistry, these states are located on the particle surface, 1.8 eV above the valence band edge of the material. Controlling the chemistry of these states will be key to uses of CuWO4 particles in tandem catalysts for overall water splitting. (C) The Author(s) 2018. Published by ECS.

J	Li, JX; Dimitrov, N				Li, Jiaxin; Dimitrov, Nikolay			NTBC and MTT Reduction Electrochemistry: Impact on Cu Superconformal Plating for Fabrication of Glass Interposers	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							ELECTROPLATED COPPER; ASPECT-RATIO; PARAMETERS; MICROVIA; VIAS; DEPOSITION; ADDITIVES; CHEMISTRY; ELECTRODE; BROMIDE	Nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (NTBC) and thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) are the organic additives applied successfully in Cu superconformal filling of through glass vias (TGVs) with aspect ratios 6:1 and 10:1. However, traces of purple inclusion were observed through the cross-sectioning of electroplated samples indicating that a reduction could likely be occurring during the plating process. In this work, the reduction propensity of NTBC and MTT in the course of Cu superconformal plating was assessed in the absence of Cu(II) ions by cyclic voltammetry, controlled-potential electrolysis (CPE), and UV-Vis spectroscopy. A CPE potential of -0.25 V vs Ag/AgCl reference electrode was selected aiming at studying the reduction process as close as possible to the actual potential range of Cu deposition. The CPE and UV-Vis results suggest that both additives reduce steadily with time generating different (by)products. Also, it is shown that the MTT reduces itself at a rate that is substantial at lower pH, producing both surface precipitates and soluble reduction products. Unlike that, the NTBC reduction exhibits weaker pH dependence and generates lower quantity of surface precipitates only. Thus, the reduction of MTT is expected to impact considerably stronger than NTBC the Cu superconformal plating process in TGVs. (C) The Author(s) 2018. Published by ECS.

We demonstrate how pyrolysis of electro-mechanically stressed Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers, infused with carbon nanotubes, will result in a unique graphitic electrode, which possesses enhanced and multifaceted electrochemical behavior. As corroborated by materials characterization, the microstructure of the stress-activated pyrolytic carbon (SAPC) characteristically contains a high proportion of disorders in the forms of edge planes and embedded heterogeneous nitrogen atoms. These disorders introduce a range of energy states near the Fermi level, yielding enhanced kinetics in the as-synthesized SAPC electrodes. A comprehensive electrochemical study of the SAPC electrode in surface sensitive ([Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-)), surface insensitive ([IrCl6](2-/3-)), and adsorption sensitive (dopamine) redox probes demonstrates 5-14-fold increases in its heterogeneous electron transfer rate compared to regular PAN-based carbon electrodes. The fast kinetics of SAPC electrodes in adsorption sensitive analytes translates into its capability for simultaneous detection of dopamine, uric acid, and ascorbic acid. The results point to a new class of pyrolytic carbon electrodes with an attractive electrocatalytic capacity, geared toward electrochemical sensing platforms. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, large volume expansion, poor intrinsic conductivity, and sluggish reaction kinetics have greatly hindered its practical application. The controlled creation of oxygen vacancy (OV) defects allows the intrinsic properties of SnO2 to be effectively modulated, but related work concerning SIBs is still lacking. In this Minireview, the mechanism of failure of SnO2 electrodes is discussed and an overview of recent progress in the general synthesis of OV-containing SnO2 materials and the feasible detection of OVs in SnO2 is presented. The use of OV-containing SnO2-based anode materials in SIBs is also reviewed. Finally, challenges and future opportunities to engineer OVs for semiconductor oxides are examined.

Co-Mo-P Based Electrocatalyst for Superior Reactivity in the Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction	CHEMCATCHEM			English	Article						alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction; Electrodeposition; Co-Mo-P amorphous films; electrochemistry; water splitting	WATER; COBALT; EFFICIENT; CATALYSTS; PHOSPHIDE; SURFACE; SITES; FILMS; FE	Energy efficient hydrogen production via electrochemical and/or photoelectrochemical water splitting holds significant potential for clean and sustainable energy. Toward this end, a significant amount of research has been focused on developing active earth abundant metal catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for use in acidic and alkaline media. Here, we report an earth abundant metal-based catalyst for HER under alkaline conditions. The catalyst consisting of Co, Mo and P had a similar HER activity as the precious metal platinum under the conditions used in the study. The Co-Mo-P catalyst is amorphous and was prepared by room temperature electrodeposition. The best Co-Mo-P catalyst exhibited an overpotential of similar to 30-35 mV for HER at a geometrical current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline medium. An amorphous Co-Mo-P model was used to simulate the energetics of HER intermediates with density functional theory (DFT). The DFT study suggests that a Co-Mo center acts as the water-dissociation site enhancing the alkaline medium HER.

Single-Crystal Electrochemistry Reveals Why Metal Nanowires Grow	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							ENHANCED ELECTROCATALYTIC PERFORMANCE; INITIO MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; CU SURFACES; SILVER; ULTRATHIN; HEXADECYLAMINE; ADSORPTION; NANOTUBES; NETWORK	Shape-control is used to tune the properties of metal nanostructures in applications ranging from catalysts to touch screens, but the origins of anisotropic growth of metal nanocrystals in solution are unknown. We show single-crystal electrochemistry can test hypotheses for why nanostructures form and predict conditions for anisotropic growth by quantifying the degree to which different species cause facet-selective metal deposition. Electrochemical measurements show disruption of alkylamine monolayers by chloride ions causes facet-selective Cu deposition. An intermediate range of chloride concentrations maximizes facet-selective Cu deposition on single crystals and produces the highest aspect ratio nanowires in a solution-phase synthesis. DFT calculations similarly show an intermediate monolayer coverage of chloride displaces the alkylamine capping agent from the ends but not the sides of a nanowire, facilitating anisotropic growth.

In this work, altogether 12 new X-ray structures of saddled, waved and ruffled porphyrins are reported. Three types of deformed porphyrins as mimics of heme were evaluated and analyzed by geometric deconstruction, spectral comparison, and electrochemical tracking, which shows a unique relationship of deformation fashions and distortion degree to the geometry of the core and electron transfer ability of rings in these enzyme containing porphyrins. These mimics can adjust their core geometry for changing the structures of potential metals; while for rings themselves, they can also regulate the electron activity by switching the HOMO of the large systems. These deformed porphyrins can be used as ideal mimics for heme. These findings help us to understand the principle and contribution of these deformations to electron transfer in catalytic oxidation and photoreactions. The nonplanar mimics have been synthesized through a modular synthetic approach under Adler-Longo or Lindsey condensation conditions.

Probing Electrocatalysis at Individual Au Nanorods via Correlated Optical and Electrochemical Measurements	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							HIGH-MASS TRANSPORT; SINGLE-MOLECULE; NANOSCALE ELECTROCHEMISTRY; NANOPARTICLE COLLISIONS; CELL MICROSCOPY; GOLD NANOPARTICLES; HYDROGEN OXIDATION; ASPECT RATIO; SURFACE; PLATINUM	A novel analytical methodology based on correlated optical and electroanalytical measurements was developed to probe electrocatalytic reactions at individual nanoparticles (NPs) with well-defined geometries. The developed methodology, Optically Targeted ElectroChemical Cell Microscopy (OTECCM), relies on a combination of optical hyperspectral imaging, to locate individual NPs and provide structural information, and Scanning ElectroChemical Cell Microscopy (SECCM), to provide direct information on the electrochemical behavior of the same NPs. This complementary strategy allows for SECCM measurements to be carried out in a "targeted" fashion, offering significant throughput advantages over conventional, scanning-based approaches. The developed methodology was applied to study the electrocatalytic oxidation of hydrazine at individual Au nanorods (NRs). Correlated electron microscopy investigations were carried out to conclusively demonstrate the ability of the proposed methodology to probe electrochemical reactions at individual NRs. A wide variety in behavior of the individual NRs was observed, with surface reactions at Au playing a prominent role in the observed response. In situ spectroscopic investigations at individual NRs suggest surface restructuring and/or residual ligand desorption leads to significant changes in catalytic activity over time. Results from the correlated electron microscopy investigations as well as the statistical analyses of data obtained for hundreds of individual nanostructures suggest that the gross geometry of a NR is a poor predictor of its electrocatalytic performance.

Acetone, a clean and electrospray ionization (ESI) compatible solvent, is used as the photoinitiator (1% volume) in the solvent system consisting of 1:1 alkyl alcohol and water. Under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation (similar to 254 nm), the acetone/alcohol system produces hydroxyalkyl radicals, which are responsible for disulfide bond cleavage in peptides. Acetone/isopropanol is most suitable for optimizing the disulfide reduction products, leading to almost complete conversion in less than 5 s when the reaction is conducted in a flow microreactor. The flow microreactor device not only facilitates direct coupling with ESI-MS but also allows fine-tuning of the extent of disulfide reduction by varying the UV exposure time. Near full sequence coverage for peptides consisting of intra- or interchain disulfide bonds has been achieved from complete disulfide reduction and online tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) via low energy collision-induced dissociation. Coupling different degrees of partial disulfide reduction with ESI-MS/MS allows disulfide mapping as demonstrated for characterizing the three disulfide bonds in insulin.

Model Complexes for the Ni-p Site of Acetyl Coenzyme A Synthase/Carbon Monoxide (CO) Dehydrogenase: Structure, Electrochemistry, and CO Reactivity	INORGANIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article							A-CLUSTER; ACTIVE-SITE; ELECTRONIC-PROPERTIES; BIMETALLIC SUBUNIT; NICKEL; MECHANISM; THIOLATE; TRINUCLEAR; CRYSTAL; ANALOGS	Aliphatic thiolato-S-bridged tri- and binuclear nickel(II) complexes have been synthesized and characterized as models for the Ni-p site of the A cluster of acetyl coenzyme A synthase (ACS)/carbon monooxide.(CO) dehydrogenase. Reaction of the in situ formed N2Sthiol donor ligands with [Ni(H2O)(6)](ClO4)(2) afforded the trinuclear complexes [Ni-(L-Me(S))(2)Ni}(2)](ClO4)(2)center dot CH3CN (1 center dot CH3CN) and [Ni-{(L-Br(S))(2)Ni}(2)](CIO4)(2)center dot 5H(2)O (2 center dot 5H(2)O) following self-assembly. Complexes 1 and 2 react with [Ni(dppe)Cl-2] and dppe [dppe = 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane] to afford the binuclear [Ni(dppe)Ni(L-Me(s))(2)](ClO4)(2)center dot 2H(2)O (3 center dot 2H(2)O) and [Ni(dppe)Ni(L-Br(s))(2)](ClO4)(2)center dot 0.750(C2H5)(2) [4.0.750-(C2H5)(2)], respectively. The X-ray crystal structures of 1-4 revealed a central (NiS4)-S-II moiety in 1 and 2 and a (NiP2S2)-P-II moiety in 3 and 4; both moieties have a square-planar environment around Ni and may mimic the properties of the Nip site of ACS. The electrochemical reduction of both terminal Ni-II ions of 1 and 2 occurs simultaneously, which is further confirmed by the isolation of [Ni{(L-Me(s))(2)Ni(NO)}(2)](ClO4)(2) (5) and [Ni{(L-Br(s))(2)Ni(NO)}(2)](ClO4)(2) (6) following reductive nitrosylation of 1 and 2. Complexes 5 and 6 exhibit nu(NO) at 1773 and 1789 cm(-1), respectively. In the presence of 02, both 5 and 6 transform to nitrite-bound monomers [(LMe(S-S))Ni(NO2)]-(ClO4) (7) and [LBr(S-S))Ni(NO2)](ClO4)(2) (8). The nature of the ligand modification is evident from the X-ray crystal structure of 7. To understand the origin of multiple reductive responses of 1-4, complex [(L-Me(SMe))(2)Ni](ClO4)(2) (9) is considered. The central NiS4 part of 1 is labile like the Nip site of ACS and can be replaced by phenanthroline. The treatment of CO to reduce 3 generates a 3(red)-(CO)(2) species, as confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (nu(CO) = 1997 and 2068 cm(-1)) and electron paramagnetic resonance (g(1) = 2.18, g(2) = 2.13, g(3) = 1.95, and A(P) = 30-80 G) spectroscopy. The CO binding to Ni-I of 3(red) is relevant to the ACS activity.

By defining a next generation of fast-response electrochemical CO2 sensors and materials, one can contribute to local monitoring of CO2 flows from industrial plants and processes, for energy management and building control or to track climate alterations. Electrochemical Li+-garnet-based sensors with Li7La3Zr2O12 solid electrolytes can reach notable 1 min response time at lowered operation temperatures to track 400-4000 ppm levels of CO2 when compared with state-of-the-art NASICON-based sensors. By using principles of redefining the electrode electrochemistry, it is demonstrated that Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 can be used to alter its classic use as energy-storage function to gain additional functions such as CO2 tracking.

Chronoamperometry studies revealed that these devices could maintain a steady power density output under typical SOFC operating conditions. High-temperature Raman measurements of SFMO coupons exposed to methanol and ethanol (and their gas phase pyrolysis products) showed the presence of spectroscopic features associated with ordered and disordered forms of graphitic carbon. However, once SFMO was employed as an anode in an electrolyte-supported SOFC, the graphite features disappear implying that these materials are not susceptible to carbon accumulation in functioning devices. These electrochemical and operando Raman measurements provided insight into SFMO's ability to act as an effective anode catalyst for SOFCs operating with direct alcohol fuel sources.

The union of electro-active quinone with pi-conjugated polyaniline was created by the first chemical synthesis of para-dimethoxybenzene-functionalized aniline as a monomer using a palladium-mediated coupling. The successful polymerization of the as-prepared monomer was accomplished without acid additives. Its post-polymerization modification with strong Lewis acid boron tribromide furnished unique poly (aniline quinone/hydroquinone) with desired properties for all-solid-state reference electrode (RE) applications. The electrochemical responses from the conjugated polyaniline backbone in this unique polymer have been "suppressed" by the quinone pendant. The resulting poly (aniline quinone) showed a quasi-reversible redox process from the redox behavior of the pendant quinone. The stable electrode potential of this poly (aniline quinone/hydroquinone) suggested that it was a single phase in which the amounts of totally reduced and totally oxidized species could be maintained at a constant in various solvents and electrolytes. Its electrochemical stability was excellent with 95% peak current retention after continuous cyclic voltammetric testing. The aniline and quinone moieties in poly (aniline quinone/hydroquinone) render it to have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic compatibility. It showed excellent behavior as a reference electrode in aqueous and non-aqueous media and can be used in both non-zero current and zero-current conditions, providing a stable potential with a maximum potential drift of similar to 4.7 mV over ten consecutive days.

Bioelectronics is a fast-growing interdisciplinary research field that involves interfacing biomaterials with electronics, covering an array of biodevices, encompassing biofuel cells, biosensors, ingestibles, and implantables. In particular, enzyme-based bioelectronics, built on diverse biocatalytic reactions, offers distinct advantages and represents a centerpiece of wearable biodevices. Such wearable bioelectronic devices predominately rely on oxidoreductase enzymes and have already demonstrated considerable promise for on-body applications ranging from highly selective noninvasive biomarker monitoring to epidermal energy harvesting. These systems can thus greatly increase the analytical capability of wearable devices from the ubiquitous monitoring of mobility and vital signs, toward the noninvasive analysis of important chemical biomarkers. Wearable enzyme electrodes offer exciting opportunities to a variety of areas, spanning from healthcare, sport, to the environment or defense. These include real-time noninvasive detection of biomarkers in biofluids (such as sweat, saliva, interstitial fluid and tears), and the monitoring of environmental pollutants and security threats in the immediate surrounding of the wearer. Furthermore, the interface of enzymes with conducting flexible electrode materials can be exploited for developing biofuel cells, which rely on the bioelectrocatalytic oxidation of biological fuels, such as lactate or glucose, for energy harvesting applications. Crucial for such successful application of enzymatic bioelectronics is deep knowledge of enzyme electron-transfer kinetics, enzyme stability, and enzyme immobilization strategies. Such understanding is critical for establishing efficient electrical contacting between the redox enzymes and the conducting electrode supports, which is of fundamental interest for the development of robust and efficient bioelectronic platforms. Furthermore, stretchable and flexible bioelectronic platforms, with mechanical properties similar to those of biological tissues, are essential for handling the rigors of on-body operation. As such, special attention must be given to changes in the behavior of enzymes due to the uncontrolled conditions of on-body operation (including diverse outdoor activities and different biofluids), for maintaining the attractive performance that these bioelectronics devices display in controlled laboratory settings. Therefore, a focus of this Account is on interfacing biocatalytic layers onto wearable electronic devices for creating efficient and stable on-body electrochemical biosensors and biofuel cells. With proper attention to key challenges and by leveraging the advantages of biocatalysis, electrochemistry, and flexible electronics, wearable bioelectronic devices could have a tremendous impact on diverse biomedical, fitness, and defense fields.

Opposing mechanisms underlying differential changes in brain oxygen an temperature induced by intravenous morphine	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						metabolism; neurovascular coupling; nucleus accumbens; opioids; oxygen electrochemistry; rats	C-FOS EXPRESSION; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; PHYSIOLOGICAL FLUCTUATIONS; BLOOD-PRESSURE; HEROIN; PENETRATION; HOMEOSTASIS; ANESTHESIA; FOREBRAIN; OXYCODONE	Morphine remains widely used in clinical settings due to its potent analgesic properties. However, one of the gravest risks of all opioids is their ability to induce respiratory depression and subsequent brain hypoxia that can lead to coma and death. Due to these life-threatening effects, our goal was to examine the effects of intravenous morphine at a wide range of doses (0.1-6.4 mg/kg) on changes in brain oxygen levels in freely moving rats. We used oxygen sensors coupled with high-speed amperometry and conducted measurements in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and subcutaneous (SC) space, the latter serving as a proxy for blood oxygen levels that depend on respiratory activity. We also examined the effects of morphine on NAc, muscle, and skin temperature. Morphine induced dose-dependent decreases in SC oxygen levels, suggesting respiratory depression, but differential effects on NAc oxygen: increases at low and moderate doses (0.1-1.6 mg/kg) and decreases at the highest dose tested (6.4 mg/kg). Morphine also increased brain temperature at low and moderate doses but induced a biphasic, down-up change at high doses. The oxygen increases appear to result from a neurovascular coupling mechanism via local vasodilation and enhanced oxygen entry into brain tissue to compensate for blood oxygen drops caused by modest respiratory depression. At high morphine doses, this adaptive mechanism is unable to compensate for the enhanced respiratory depression, resulting in brain hypoxia. Hence, morphine appears to be safe when used as an analgesic at clinically relevant doses but poses great risks at high doses, likely to be abused by drug users. NEW & NOTEWORTHY With the use of oxygen sensors coupled with amperometry, we show that morphine induces differential effects on brain oxygen levels, slightly increasing them at low doses and strongly decreasing them at high doses. In contrast, morphine dose dependently decreases oxygen levels in the SC space. Therefore, morphine engages opposing mechanisms affecting brain oxygen levels, enhancing them through neurovascular coupling at low, clinically relevant doses and decreasing them due to dramatic respiratory depression at high doses, likely to be abused.

Here, we report on bimetallic size- selected Cu100-xCox nanoparticle (NP) catalysts for CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR) and we identify the optimum Cu/Co ratio and NP size leading to improved activity and selectivity. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and quasi in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) provided insight into the morphological, structural, and chemical transformations underwent by the CuCo NPs during CO2RR. We illustrate that the as-prepared state of the bimetallic NPs is drastically different from the structure and surface composition of the working catalyst. Under electrochemical conditions, a reduction of both initially oxidized metallic species was observed, accompanied by Cu surface segregation. Density functional theory (DFT) results from a Cu3X model were used to describe the surface segregation. In order to extract mechanistic understanding, the activity of the experimental Cu and CuCo NPs towards CO2RR was described via DFT in terms of the interaction of Cu facets under expansion and compression with key reaction intermediates, in particular CO* and COOH*.

Fundamental principles of battery design	PHYSICAL SCIENCES REVIEWS			English	Article						battery; electrochemistry; ionic transport; diffusion; migration; interface kinetics; crystallography	ENERGY-STORAGE; BUTLER-VOLMER; ION; OVERVOLTAGE; PROGRESS	With an increasing diversity of electrical energy sources, in particular with respect to the pool of renewable energies, and a growing complexity of electrical energy usage, the need for storage solutions to counterbalance the discrepancy of demand and offer is inevitable. In principle, a battery seems to be a simple device since it just requires three basic components - two electrodes and an electrolyte - in contact with each other. However, only the control of the interplay of these components as well as their dynamics, in particular the chemical reactions, can yield a high-performance system. Moreover, specific aspects such as production costs, weight, material composition and morphology, material criticality, and production conditions, among many others, need to be fulfilled at the same time. They present some of the countless challenges, which make battery design a long-lasting, effortful task. This chapter gives an introduction to the fundamental concepts of batteries. The principles are exemplified for the basic Daniell cell followed by a review of Nernst equation, electrified interface reactions, and ionic transport. The focus is addressed to crystalline materials. A comprehensive discussion of crystal chemical and crystal physical peculiarities reflects favourable and unfavourable local structural aspects from a crystallographic view as well as considerations with respect to electronic structure and bonding. A brief classification of battery types concludes the chapter.

The peptide is designed to optimize the interfacial interaction of horse heart cytochrome c (cytc) through the electrostatic interaction of the carboxylate group on the terminal amino acid glutamate and the amine on lysine in cytc. Cytc exhibits quasi-reversible voltammetry and is stable on the time scale of the experiments. Marcus theory is used to calculate the electron transfer rates, which are -5 times faster for cytc/peptide/Au compared to cytc/11-mercaptoundecanoic acid/Au SAMs of similar chain length. The formal potentials also shift for the cytc/peptide system -20 mV more positive than cytc adsorbed to 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid-SAM/Au electrodes.

In this article, we report a nanocomposite of anatase titania nanoparticles (TiO2-NPs), carbon nanotubes, and carbon nanofibers as a freestanding gas diffusion cathode for Li-CO2 batteries. Nanostructured anatase TiO2 is demonstrated as a low-cost, easy-to synthesize catalyst for CO2 capture and utilization.

In order to make electrocatalysts economically competitive for large-scale applications, increasing attention has been devoted to developing noble metal-free HER and HOR electrocatalysts especially for alkaline electrolytes due to the promise of emerging hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cells. Herein, we report that interface engineering of Ni3N and Ni results in a unique Ni3N/Ni electrocatalyst which exhibits exceptional HER/HOR activities in aqueous electrolytes. A systematic electro-chemical study was carried out to investigate the superior hydrogen electrochemistry catalyzed by Ni3N/Ni, including nearly zero overpotential of catalytic onset, robust long-term durability, unity Faradaic efficiency, and excellent CO tolerance. Density functional theory computations were performed to aid the understanding of the electrochemical results and suggested that the real active sites are located at the interface between Ni3N and Ni.

Vertical vs. adiabatic ionization energies in solution and gas-phase: probing ionization-induced reorganization in conformationally-mobile bichromophoric actuators using photoelectron spectroscopy, electrochemistry and theory	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							SELF-INTERACTION ERROR; CHARGE DELOCALIZATION; COUNTERPOISE CORRECTIONS; ELECTRON-TRANSFER; THROUGH-SPACE; STATES; TRANSFORMATION; POTENTIALS; COMPONENTS; CATION	Ionization-induced structural and conformational reorganization in various -stacked dimers and covalently linked bichromophores is relevant to many processes in biological systems and functional materials. In this work, we examine the role of structural, conformational, and solvent reorganization in a set of conformationally mobile bichromophoric donors, using a combination of gas-phase photoelectron spectroscopy, solution-phase electrochemistry, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Photoelectron spectral analysis yields both adiabatic and vertical ionization energies (AIE/VIE), which are compared with measured (adiabatic) solution-phase oxidation potentials (E-ox). Importantly, we find a strong correlation of E-ox with AIE, but not VIE, reflecting variations in the attendant structural/conformational reorganization upon ionization. A careful comparison of the experimental data with the DFT calculations allowed us to probe the extent of charge stabilization in the gas phase and solution and to parse the reorganizational energy into its various components. This study highlights the importance of a synergistic approach of experiment and theory to study ionization-induced structural and conformational reorganization.

Here, we introduce a glucose oxidase-coated metallic cotton fiber-based hybrid biofuel cell with efficient electrical communication between the anodic enzyme and the conductive support. Gold nanoparticles are layer-bylayer assembled with small organic linkers onto cotton fibers to form metallic cotton fibers with extremely high conductivity (>2.1x10(4) S cm(-1)), and are used as an enzyme-free cathode as well as a conductive support for the enzymatic anode. For preparation of the anode, the glucose oxidase is sequentially layer-by-layer-assembled with the same linkers onto the metallic cotton fibers. The resulting biofuel cells exhibit a remarkable power density of 3.7 mW cm(-2), significantly outperforming conventional biofuel cells. Our strategy to promote charge transfer through electrodes can provide an important tool to improve the performance of biofuel cells.

The performance of a photo-electrochemical (PEC) system is directly related to the interfacial electrical band energy landscape. Recently, piezotronics has stood out as a promising strategy for tuning interfacial energetics. It applies intrinsic or deformation-induced ionic displacements (ferroelectric and piezoelectric polarizations) to engineer the interfacial charge distribution, and thereby the band structures of PEC electrodes. Here, contemporary research efforts of coupling piezotronics with photo-electrochemisty are reviewed. Quantitative band diagrams of a polarization-tuned semiconductor-electrolyte junction are first introduced, with an emphasis on the impact of interface chemistry. Experimental advances of employing piezoelectric and ferroelectric polarizations to enhance the charge separation and transportation, and surface kinetics of PEC water splitting are discussed. Finally, critical challenges of applying piezotronics in PEC systems and promising solutions are presented.

The nickel battery positive electrode revisited: stability and structure of the beta-NiOOH phase	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							INITIO MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; HYDROXIDE ELECTRODES; TRANSITION; INSIGHTS; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; 1ST-PRINCIPLES; DIFFRACTION; REFINEMENT; SURFACE	The crystal structure of the nickel battery positive electrode material, beta-NiOOH, is analyzed through a joint approach involving NMR and FTIR spectroscopies, powder neutron diffraction and DFT calculations. The obtained results confirm that structural changes occur during the beta-Ni(OH)(2)/beta-NiOOH transformation leading to a metastable crystal structure with a TP2 host lattice. This structure involves two types of hydrogen atoms both forming primary and secondary hydrogen bonds. The formation of TP2 NiOOH as opposed to the more stable P3 host type during beta-Ni(OH)(2)/beta-NiOOH transformation has a kinetic origin that can be understood by a lower strain penalty involved in the transformation.

The effects of different surface-treatment conditions on interphase chemistries, morphologies, and local atomic environments are studied with the combination of surface-sensitive electron microscopy and local-probe solid state nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. A variation of Al2O3 , LiAlO2, and other lithium-bearing species with different phases and morphologies are formed as an interphase on top of NMC532, controlled by the polarity of solvent systems, the corrosivity of aluminum salts, the initial alumina loading, and the annealing temperature. The nature of these initial surface interphases shows great influence on electrode impedance, initial capacities, and capacity retention rates in electrochemical tests. Post-electrochemistry characterizations on cycled cathodes show that surface LiAlO2 phases are relatively stable against the potential HF etching, whereas Al2O3 is reacted and consumed. Both half-cell and full-cell testing results of cathodes treated by optimized protocols demonstrate remarkable improvements in the capacity retention compared with the baseline.

Modeling Zinc Electrowinning for Current Efficiency Prediction Based on Nernst-Plank Equation and Electrode Gas Evolution Reaction Kinetics	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							CURRENT-DENSITY	Zinc electrowinning is by nature complex, involving the electrodeposition of Zn ions on cathode, oxygen evolution on the anode, as well as the hydrogen evolution on the cathode as a side reaction which decreases the current efficiency and increases the energy consumption while improving local mass transport. Because of the capital-intensive features and the low efficiencies of experimental research approaches, modeling and simulation have become a promising way to study the electrowinning processes. The coupling of gas-liquid two-phase flow from gas evolution with the electrochemistry process, however, is challenging to simulate. In this paper, an approach of building a comprehensive Zn electrowinning model based on COMSOL Multiphysics was introduced. Further, the basic model results in velocity field, concentration distribution, gas fractions, and current efficiency were demonstrated and discussed. In addition, validation of the current efficiency predictions from the model was performed through a comparison with experimental test data. (C) The Author(s) 2018. Published by ECS.

Here, we introduce a novel technique for fabricating silver-stibnite nanoporous plasmonic films. Unlike conventional techniques that are usually used to fabricate nanoporous plasmonic films, we use a room-temperature growth method that is wet-chemistry free, which enables wafer-scale fabrication of nanoporous films on flexible substrates. We show the existence of propagating surface plasmon polaritons in nanoporous films and demonstrate the extreme bulk refractive index sensitivity of the films using the Goos Hanchen shift interrogation scheme. In the proof-of-concept biosensing experiments, we functionalize the nanoporous films with biotin-thiol using a modified functionalization technique, to capture streptavidin. The fractal nature of the films increases the overlap between the local field and the immobilized biomolecules. The extreme sensitivity of the Goos Hanchen shift allows femtomolar concentrations of streptavidin to be detected in real time, which is unprecedented using surface plasmons configuration.

The complexation energies of the investigated cobalt corroles were theoretically calculated to illustrate the propensity of the cobalt center for penta-coordination or hexa-coordination with various axial ligands (DMSO, CO, py and NH3). The structure of one hexacoordinate bis-NH3 cobalt corrole complex was also determined by X-ray diffraction.

Electrochemistry is traditionally a powerful tool for metal analysis but can be limited by its scope and low temporal resolution. The scope is limited by the potential window of the working electrode and rapid analysis is limited, in part, by the need for nucleation/growth for preconcentration. In prior work, we showed that a rapid equilibrium mediated preconcentration process facilitated fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) responses to Cu(II) and Pb(II) at carbon fiber micro electrodes (CFMs). In this manuscript, we apply this same principle to Ca(II), Al(III), Mg(II), and Zn(II), metal ions that are traditionally difficult to electroanalyze. We demonstrate FSCV reduction peaks for these four metals whose positions 8 and amplitudes are dependent on scan rate. The adsorption profiles of these ions onto CFMs follow Langmuir's theory for monolayer coverage. We calculate the thermodynamic equilibrium constant of metal adsorption onto CFMs and find that these constants follow the same order as those previously reported by other groups on other activated carbon materials. Finally, a real-time complexation study is performed with ligands that have preference for divalent or multivalent ions to probe the selectivity of the real-time signal. We observe a linear relationship between formation constant (k(f)) and % change in the FSCV signal and use this correlation to, for the first time, report the k(f) of an Al(III)-complex. This work demonstrates the versatility of FSCV as a method with capacity to extend the scope of rapid electroanalysis.

The modified membrane was characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDAX), X-Ray diffraction (XRD). A simple solution based approach was used to prepare AgNPs on biomembrane followed by glutaraldehyde activation to immobilize Tyr on the nanoparticles decorated ESM. The direct electrochemistry of DA oxidation was performed through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). Characterization of membrane was accomplished by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Prepared electrode showed very good stability, reproducibility, high selectivity, easy preparation and regeneration of electrode. The proposed sensor exhibited low detection limits 1.7ngL(-1) with wide linear range 10-1000 ngL(-1), excellent sensitivity (14.28 mu A mu gL(-1)cm(-2)) with good storage and operational stabilities. The accurate measurement of dopamine in blood serum and good recoveries in spiked serum samples ensured great potential for medical diagnostics.

In contrast to conventional homopolymers used for electrode modification, BCPs afford periodic nanoscale structures (microdomains) of uniform dimensions (5-100nm) and predictable morphologies, which can be controlled by adjusting the lengths of individual homopolymer segments. BCPs usable for electrochemical applications consist of two or more segments that form solute-permeable, redox-active or etchable microdomains and a chemically inert matrix. The resulting microdomains afford nanoscale molecular/charge transport pathways toward the underlying electrode, whereas the matrix serves as a scaffold to improve film stability in solution. These polymeric thin films provide a unique means for fabricating nanowire arrays via template-based electrochemical synthesis, designing electrochemical sensors with unique selectivity, and constructing electrochemically-tunable functional materials.

Herein, a model is developed to extend NTA to allow dynamic NP sizing and to analyze the kinetics of growth of NPs in solution. Interpreting the NP trajectories as scaled Brownian motion, Monte Carlo simulations produce stochastic trajectories of growing NPs (under diffusion-con trolled growth). These trajectories are grounds for determining a strategy to estimate the growth parameters of individual NPs from the time evolution analysis of the mean square displacement (MSD) curves. In particular, we evaluate the accuracy and precision of the parameter estimates from MSD analysis. In addition, the strategy is illustrated to depict the homogeneous electrosynthesis of silver NPs from the oxidation of a sacrificial Ag ultramicroelectrode (UME) in Fe2+ solution.

Microtube-Membrane Methodology for Electrochemical Synthesis and Study of Electroactive and lonically Conductive Materials, and the Conductivity of MnO2	CHEMELECTROCHEM			English	Article						bipolar electrochemical synthesis; electrochemistry; gold-microtube membranes; ionic conductivity; manganese dioxide	CHARGE-STORAGE PROPERTIES; MANGANESE OXIDES; BIPOLAR ELECTROCHEMISTRY; ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY; TRANSPORT-PROPERTIES; ELECTRODE MATERIALS; IONIC-CONDUCTIVITY; PERFORMANCE; NANOWIRES; NANORODS	A membrane-based methodology for electrochemical synthesis and study of electroactive and ionically conductive materials is described. The Li+-intercalation material MnO2 was used to demonstrate this methodology. The membrane was a polymeric support containing monodisperse gold microtubes (diameter 600 nm) that span the thickness of the membrane. Bipolar electrochemical synthesis of MnO2, from Mn2+ solutions, was conducted across this membrane, resulting in deposition of monodisperse, hemispherical MnO2 particles at the open ends of the tubes on one face of the membrane. The resulting microtube/MnO2 composite membrane makes a convenient construct for investigating the transport properties of the MnO2 particles. This was accomplished by mounting the membrane in a U-tube cell, placing electrolyte solutions on either side, and driving an ionic current through the membrane. The ionic conductivity of MnO2 was measured in this way, and found to be 40 +/- 10 mu S cm(-1) when LiCI or LiCIO4 solutions were used as the electrolyte. The mechanism of ionic conductivity through these MnO2 particles is discussed.

The method has demonstrated promising potential for the analysis of catalytic activity, physicochemical parameters, fundamental surface properties, functionalization and reactivity of NPs. Here, the most recent developments and capabilities of this method as a novel tool for characterizing nanoscale properties are discussed, illustrating novel applications for assessing bioconjugation, designing ultrasensitive biosensing methods and monitoring processes of biological and environmental significance. The main advantages and limitations as compared to commonly used spectroscopy and imaging techniques are described, highlighting areas in which collision measurements can be used as a complementary approach to characterize properties of inorganic NPs, organic molecules, soft materials and biologicals, and develop methodologies for detection and quantification of analytes of interest in the bioanalytical, biological and environmental fields. An overview of potential applications in these fields is provided along with a critical discussion of future research needs and opportunities.

The general design of a Hall circuit based on a semiconductor heterostructure, which forms a shallow 2D electron gas and is used as an electrode, is described. Three different types of spin-selective processes have been studied with this device in the past: i) photoinduced charge exchange between quantum dots and the working electrode through chiral molecules is associated with spin polarization that creates a local magnetization and generates a Hall voltage; ii) charge polarization of chiral molecules by an applied voltage is accompanied by a spin polarization that generates a Hall voltage; and iii) cyclic voltammetry (current-voltage) measurements of electrochemical redox reactions that can be spin-analyzed by the Hall circuit to provide a third dimension (spin) in addition to the well-known current and voltage dimensions. The three studies reviewed open new doors into understanding both the spin current and the charge current in electronic materials and electrochemical processes.

Lithography-Free Electrochemical Patterning of Conductive Substrates with Metal Oxides	SMALL			English	Article						emulsion; lithography-free; metal oxide catalyst; RIPPLE; silicon patterning	SOFT LITHOGRAPHY; NANOSTRUCTURES; SURFACES; FACILE	Reactive interface patterning promoted by lithographic electrochemistry serves as a facile method for generating submicron structures on conductive substrates. A binary-potential step applied to a metal layer with a resist overlayer allows silicon to be patterned with metal oxides. In this study, the role and influence of the resist overlayer on the uniformity of pattern formation are examined. The ability of the resist to detach from the underlying metal is a critical determinant of pattern geometry. By choosing an appropriate resist, large patterns with submicron precision are generated quickly by the application of the binary-potential steps. From this information, a lithography-free approach to generating identical patterns is achieved with simple resists such as that furnished from a lacquer-water emulsion, thus greatly simplifying the patterning of silicon with metal oxide catalysts.

Select prototype systems are used to describe how the interplay between materials properties such as crystal field splitting, band edge energies, surface termination, material length scale, dielectric constant, and isoelectric point, and electrolyte properties such as pH and ion type, impacts electrochemical behaviori.e., redox potentials, reaction enthalpies, reactivity, and decoupled ionic/electronic processes. Ab initio modeling of charged defects and intercalants within the grand canonical unified electrochemical band-diagram (UEB) framework is shown to enable the quantitative prediction of electrochemical materials behavior. UEB combines electrochemical theory, charged defect theory, and band diagram descriptions and can be used both for materials discovery and development. First, a pedagogical description of the UEB framework is presented, and then the application of this framework to reveal mechanisms for high rate electronic charge storage in cation incorporated -MnO2 and -MnO2, high desalination efficiency of thin-film NaMn4O8, and the flat charge/discharge profile of FePO4 is reviewed. Finally, new prospects for the application of the UEB framework to electrolyte design, interfacial engineering, and catalysis are suggested.

Determining the Viability of Hydroxide-Mediated Bifunctional HER/HOR Mechanisms through Single-Crystal Voltammetry and Microkinetic Modeling	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							HYDROGEN EVOLUTION REACTION; DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL THEORY; POTENTIAL SWEEP VOLTAMMETRY; ALKALINE MEDIA; METAL-SURFACES; ACID-SOLUTIONS; OXIDATION; PLATINUM; OXYGEN; ELECTROCHEMISTRY	The slow kinetics of the hydrogen oxidation and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER and HOR) in alkaline compared to acidic media remain a fundamental conundrum in modern electrocatalysis. Recent efforts have proposed that OH, as well as H, must bind optimally for improved kinetics, but the exact role of adsorbed OH is not yet known. In this work, we combine steady-state single-crystal voltammetry and microkinetic modeling to determine the roles of adsorbed hydroxide and the so-called bifunctional mechanism in alkaline HER and HOR kinetics. We consider both a direct Volmer mechanism, in which H and OH compete for sites on Pt (110), and an OH-mediated mechanism, in which Pt (111) adsorbs H while transition metal clusters adsorb OH. Our experimental and computational results show that on a thermodynamic coverage basis, increasing OH adsorption strength cannot promote faster HER/HOR kinetics. Only changes to the kinetic rate constants can explain experimental observations. We speculate that adequate electrocatalyst design in alkaline media additionally requires manipulation of interfacial water structure to lower energetic barriers for HER and HOR.

A key obstacle in this technology is the unstable Li/solid-state electrolyte (SSE) interface involving electrolyte reduction by Li. Herein we report a novel approach based on the use of a nanocomposite consisting of organic elastomeric salts (LiO-(CH2O)(n)-Li) and inorganic nanoparticle salts (LiF, -NSO2-Li, Li2O), which serve as an interphase to protect Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS), a highly conductive but reducible SSE. The nanocomposite is formed in situ on Li via the electro-chemical decomposition of a liquid electrolyte, thus having excellent chemical and electrochemical stability, affinity for Li and LGPS, and limited interfacial resistance. XPS depth profiling and SEM show that the nanocomposite effectively restrained the reduction of LGPS. Stable Li electrodeposition over 3000 h and a 200 cycle life for a full cell were achieved.

Biotemplated Zinc Sulfide Nanofibers as Anode Materials for Sodium-Ion Batteries	ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS			English	Article						zinc sulfide; nanofiber; biotemplating sodium-ion battery; electrochemistry	DOPED CARBON; NANOSTRUCTURES; LITHIUM; PRECIPITATION; NANOPARTICLES; MICROSPHERES; NANOSHEETS; SURFACES; ENERGY; OXIDE	Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have generated substantial interest because of the geopolitical uncertainty of the availability of lithium, as well as the potential cost savings associated with replacing lithium with sodium. One of the key technological impediments to SIBs is the availability of a high-capacity anode material. Here, we show that biotemplated zinc sulfide nanofibers, prepared using the M13 bacteriophage template, have the potential to be used for this purpose. We investigated the effect of both annealing and carbon coating on the electrochemical performance of these materials. Biotemplated zinc sulfide nanofibers, when coated with a few-nanometer carbon layer, could deliver a reversible capacity of 603 mAh/g at 100 mA/g discharge rate, even when the zinc sulfide loading is as high as 70%. The initial Coulombic efficiency reached 71%, and the electrode could be cycled for at least 100 cycles.

The present work addresses an approach toward discriminating aromatic over aliphatic alkenes in aziridination reactions, relying on the use of anionic metal reagents (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) to attenuate reactivity in a metal-dependent manner. A family of Mn-II reagents bearing a triphenylamido-amine scaffold and various pendant arms has been synthesized and characterized by various techniques, including cyclic voltammetry. Aziridination of styrene by PhI=NTs in the presence of each Mn-II catalyst establishes a trend of increasing yield with increasing Mn-II/III anodic potential. The Fe-II, Co-II, and Ni-II congeners of the highest-yielding Mn-II catalyst have been synthesized and explored in the aziridination of aromatic and aliphatic alkenes, exhibiting good to high yields with para-substituted styrenes, low to modest yields with sterically congested styrenes, and invariably low yields with aliphatic olefins. Co-II aziridination in comparison to Mn-II but is less selective than Mn-II in competitive aziridinations of nonconjugated olefins. Indeed, Mn-II proved to be highly selective even versus well-established copper and rhodium aziridination reagents. Mechanistic investigations and computational studies indicate that all metals follow a two-step styrene aziridination pathway (successive formation of two N-C bonds), featuring a turnover-limiting metal-nitrene addition to an olefinic carbon, followed by product-determining ring closure. Both steps exhibit activation barriers in the order Fe > Mn > Co, most likely stemming from relevant metal-nitrene electrophilicities and M-II/III redox potentials. The aziridination of aliphatic olefins follows the same stepwise path, albeit with a considerably higher activation barrier and a weaker driving force for the formation of the initial N-C bond, succeeded by ring closure with a miniscule barrier.

Various techniques have been explored to increase the exfoliation yield, but little is known about the underlying mechanism at the atomic level. Here, we demonstrate gold -assisted mechanical exfoliation of monolayer molybdenum disulfide, up to a centimeter scale. Detailed spectroscopic, microscopic, and first principles density functional theory analyses reveal that strong van der Waals (vdW) interaction between Au and the topmost MoS2 layer facilitates the exfoliation of monolayers. However, the large-area exfoliation promoted by such strong vdW interaction is only achievable on freshly prepared clean and smooth Au surfaces, while rough surfaces and surfaces exposed to air for more than 15 min result in negligible exfoliation yields. This technique is successfully extended to MoSe2, WS2, WSe2, MoTe2, WTe2, and GaSe. In addition, electrochemical characterization reveals intriguing interactions between monolayer MoS2 and Au. A subnanometer-thick MoS2 monolayer strongly passivates the chemical properties of the underlying Au, and the Au significantly modulates the electronic band structure of the MoS2, turning it from semiconducting to metallic. This could find applications in many areas, including electrochemistry, photovoltaics, and photocatalysis.

The cornerstone of this development was laid by the widely used computational hydrogen electrode method which involves a posteriori correction of standard constant charge first principles studies in solvent environment. The description of this technique and its contribution to our effort to understand electrocatalytic reactions on the active sites of metal-based nanoparticles are reviewed. The pathways and energetics of the relevant elementary reactions are presented. We also discussed a recent attempt in the literature to account for the inflow and outflow of electrons from the electrode as electrochemical reactions proceed, which has been greatly assisted by the development of density functional theory within the grand canonical framework. Going beyond the computational hydrogen electrode method by explicit incorporation of electrode potential within the calculations permits access to more detailed insights without requiring extra computational burden.

A threefold strategy is adopted to achieve a high rate performance. First, the mesoporous structure with high specific surface area and large pore volume facilitates the transfer of electrolyte and accommodates the large volume change. Secondly, graphitic carbon encapsulation further improves the electronic conductivity of the nanocomposite. Finally, ultrafine Fe2O3 nanocrystals effectively shorten the Na+ diffusion length. Consequently, this nanocomposite exhibits stable and fast Na+ storage, thus leading to excellent rate capability and cyclability. Pseudocapacitive behavior is found to dominate in the redox reactions, accounting for the outstanding rate and cycling performance. In addition, full cells, assembled with O3-Na-0.9[Cu0.22Fe0.30Mn0.48]O-2 as cathodes, present good electrochemical performance.

Nanoscale electrochemical kinetics & dynamics: the challenges and opportunities of single-entity measurements	FARADAY DISCUSSIONS			English	Article							CHEMICALLY-MODIFIED ELECTRODES; SCANNING-TUNNELING-MICROSCOPY; INDIVIDUAL SILVER NANOPARTICLES; THIN-LAYER ELECTROCHEMISTRY; AUFLOSUNG FESTER METALLE; CYCLIC VOLTAMMETRY; ZUM MECHANISMUS; ROTATING DISC; OHMIC DROP; NANOELECTRODES	The development of nanoscale electrochemistry since the mid-1980s has been predominately coupled with steady-state voltammetric (i-E) methods. This research has been driven by the desire to understand the mechanisms of very fast electrochemical reactions, by electroanalytical measurements in small volumes and unusual media, including in vivo measurements, and by research on correlating electrocatalytic activity, e.g., O-2 reduction reaction, with nanoparticle size and structure. Exploration of the behavior of nanoelectrochemical structures (nanoelectrodes, nanoparticles, nanogap cells, etc.) of a characteristic dimension using steady-state i-E methods generally relies on the well-known relationship, (2) approximate to Dt, which relates diffusional lengths to time, t, through the coefficient, D. Decreasing , by performing measurements at a nanometric length scales, results in a decrease in the effective timescale of the measurement, and provides a direct means to probe the kinetics of steps associated with very rapid electrochemical reactions. For instance, steady-state voltammetry using a nanogap twin-electrode cell of characteristic width, approximate to 10 nm, allows investigations of events occurring at timescales on the order of approximate to 100 ns. Among many other advantages, decreasing also increases spatial resolution in electrochemical imaging, e.g., in scanning electrochemical microscopy, and allows probing of the electric double layer. This Introductory Lecture traces the evolution and driving forces behind the (2) approximate to Dt steady-state approach to nanoscale electrochemistry, beginning in the late 1950s with the introduction of the rotating ring-disk electrode and twin-electrode thin-layer cells, and evolving to current-day investigations using nanoelectrodes, scanning nanocells for imaging, nanopores, and nanoparticles. The recent focus on so-called single-entity electrochemistry, in which individual and very short redox events are probed, is a significant departure from the steady-state approach, but provides new opportunities to probe reaction dynamics. The stochastic nature of very fast single-entity events challenges current electrochemical methods and modern electronics, as illustrated using recent experiments from the authors' laboratory.

Electrochemistry at a single nanoparticle: from bipolar regime to tunnelling	FARADAY DISCUSSIONS			English	Article							TRANSITION-METAL DICHALCOGENIDES; ELECTRON-TRANSFER; GOLD NANOPARTICLES; CHARGE-TRANSFER; NANO-IMPACTS; MICROSCOPY; KINETICS; NANOELECTRODES	This paper is concerned with long-distance interactions between an unbiased metal nanoparticle (NP) and a nanoelectrode employed as a tip in the scanning electrochemical microscope (SECM). A NP immobilized on the inert substrate acts as a bipolar electrode, producing positive SECM feedback. The tip current magnitude depends strongly on the ratio of the particle and tip radii and the heterogeneous charge-transfer kinetics. The onset of electron tunneling was observed at very short separation distances (<2-3 nm) at which the NP behaves as a part of the tip electrode. The rate constant of the electron-transfer (ET) or electrocatalytic reaction at the NP can be extracted from either feedback or tunneling current. The tunneling mode of SECM can be used to investigate heterogeneous reactions occurring at a single NP without making an ohmic contact with it. This technique can also help elucidate nanoparticle/electrode interactions in various electrochemical systems ranging from NPs immobilized on the electrode surface to nanoimpact collision events.

Science and technology of electrochemistry at nano-interfaces: concluding remarks	FARADAY DISCUSSIONS			English	Article							SINGLE-MOLECULE ANALYSIS; PLASMONIC NANOSTRUCTURES; NANOPARTICLES; KINETICS; FLUCTUATIONS; CHANNELS; DNA	The Faraday Discussion on electrochemistry at nano-interfaces presented a platform for an incredibly diverse array of advances in electrochemical nanoscience and nanotechnology. In this summary, I have identified the factors which drive the development of the science and which ultimately support many impressive technological advances described. Prime among these are the emergence of new physical behaviors when device dimensions approach characteristic physical scaling lengths, the steadily increasing importance of surfaces as device dimensions shrink, and the capacity to fabricate and utilize structures which are commensurate in size with molecules, especially biomolecules and biomolecular complexes. In this Faraday Discussion we were treated to outstanding examples of each of these nanoscience drivers to produce new, and in many cases unexpected, electrochemical phenomena that would not be observed at larger scales. The main thrust of these collective activities has been to realize the promise implicit in several transformational experiments that were carried out in the last decades of the 20th century. Our task is not complete, and we can look forward to many additional developments springing from the same intellectual wellhead.

J	Schmidt-Rohr, K				Schmidt-Rohr, Klaus			How Batteries Store and Release Energy: Explaining Basic Electrochemistry	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						First-Year Undergraduate/General; Upper-Division Undergraduate; Electrochemistry; Electrolytic/Galvanic Cells/Potentials; Misconceptions/Discrepant Events; Textbooks/Reference Books	MISCONCEPTIONS; SOLVATION	Batteries are valued as devices that store chemical energy and convert it into electrical energy. Unfortunately, the standard description of electrochemistry does not explain specifically where or how the energy is stored in a battery; explanations just in terms of electron transfer are easily shown to be at odds with experimental observations. Importantly, the Gibbs energy reduction in an electrochemical reaction in a battery also involves atom transfer between different phases. It is shown that, for simple galvanic cells or batteries with reactive metal electrodes, two intuitively meaningful contributions to the electrical energy are relevant: (i) the difference in the lattice cohesive energies of the bulk metals, reflecting metallic and covalent bonding and accounting for the atom transfer, and (ii) the difference in the ionization energies of the metals in water, associated with electron transfer. The ionization energy in water can be calculated as the sum of gas-phase ionization energies and the hydration energy of the metal ion. Entropy plays only a limited role, for instance, driving the processes in concentration cells. The prediction of the energy of batteries in terms of cohesive and aqueous ionization energies is in excellent agreement with experiment. Since the electrical energy released is equal to the reduction in Gibbs energy, which is the hallmark of a spontaneous process, the analysis also explains why specific electrochemical processes occur. In several important cases, including the classical Zn/Cu battery, the difference in the bulk-metal cohesive energies is the origin of the electrical energy released. For instance, metallic Zn, Cd, or Mg lack stabilization by bonding via unoccupied d-orbitals and are therefore of higher energy than most transition metals. Indeed, metallic zinc is shown to be the high-energy material in the alkaline household battery. The lead acid car battery is recognized as an ingenious device that splits water into 2 H-center dot(+)(aq) and O2- during charging and derives much of its electrical energy from the formation of the strong O-H bonds of H2O during discharge. The analysis provides an explanation of basic electrochemistry that will help students better understand this important topic.

Due to the high activation energy needs and the endothermic nature of CO2 reduction, the reactions are difficult to carry out. When H2O is present, hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) often compete favorably with CO2 reduction reactions. For these reactions, catalysts are of critical importance to CO2 reduction. In this article, we review the various metal nanocatalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) reactions. In recognition of the importance of H2O to CO2 reduction, we focus our discussions on systems in aqueous solutions. Nanostructured metal catalysts are chosen for the discussions because they represent the most effective catalysts for ECR. After a brief introduction of the fundamental principles of ECR, we devote the rest of the article on the discussions of various types of nanostructured metallic catalysts, which are categorized by their compositions and working mechanisms. Lastly, strategies for improving reaction efficiency and selectivity are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A multiphysics model that can capture crack patterns in Si thin films based on their microstructure	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Si; Anodes; Li-ion batteries; Phase field; Fracture	ION BATTERY ELECTRODES; SILICON; PROPAGATION; LITHIATION; MECHANICS; FRACTURE; PHASES	Fracture in silicon anodes has fascinated the electrochemistry community for two decades, as it can result in a 80% capacity loss over the first few electrochemical cycles and is the limiting factor in commercializing such high capacity anodes. Although numerous experimental data exist illustrating severe fracture patterns and their dependence on the scale of the microstructure, no theoretical model has been able to re-produce and capture such behaviour. In this article, a multi-physics phase-field damage model is presented that can accurately capture the long standing problem of dry bed-lake crack patterns observed for Si thin film anodes. A promising aspect of the model is that, in addition to accounting for Li-ion diffusion, it can explicitly capture the microstructure, and therefore when applied to a Si film with a thickness below 100 nm no fracture was observed, which is consistent with experiments. As fracture in continuous thin films is random, micron-hole patterned Si films were also fabricated and cycled, resulting in ordered crack patterns. The proposed model was able to capture these elaborate, yet ordered, crack patterns, further validating its efficiency in predicting damage during lithiation of Si. This paves the way to using multiscale modeling for predicting the dimensions that limit and control fracture during lithiation, prolonging hence the electrode lifetime.

Design Choices for Next-Generation Neurotechnology Can Impact Motion Artifact in Electrophysiological and Fast-Scan Cyclic Voltammetry Measurements	MICROMACHINES			English	Article						electrode; artifact; electrophysiology; electrochemistry; fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV); neurotechnology; neural interface; neuromodulation; neuroprosthetics; brain-machine interfaces	CARBON-FIBER MICROELECTRODE; CHRONIC NEURAL INTERFACES; IN-VIVO; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; RECORDINGS; ARRAYS; TISSUE; BRAIN; ENCAPSULATION; PROSTHETICS	Implantable devices to measure neurochemical or electrical activity from the brain are mainstays of neuroscience research and have become increasingly utilized as enabling components of clinical therapies. In order to increase the number of recording channels on these devices while minimizing the immune response, flexible electrodes under 10 mu m in diameter have been proposed as ideal next-generation neural interfaces. However, the representation of motion artifact during neurochemical or electrophysiological recordings using ultra-small, flexible electrodes remains unexplored. In this short communication, we characterize motion artifact generated by the movement of 7 mu m diameter carbon fiber electrodes during electrophysiological recordings and fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) measurements of electroactive neurochemicals. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, we demonstrate that artifact induced by motion can be problematic to distinguish from the characteristic signals associated with recorded action potentials or neurochemical measurements. These results underscore that new electrode materials and recording paradigms can alter the representation of common sources of artifact in vivo and therefore must be carefully characterized.

Single Pt NCs were deposited onto the CNEs using an empirically developed square-wave potential program. Characterization by scanning electron microscopy indicates that the sizes of Pt NCs are remarkably reproducible (relative standard deviation = 6%). Electrochemically active surface areas, determined by Cu underpotential deposition and H adsorption/desorption analyses, are also reproducible. Selected area electron diffraction indicates that each Pt NC is comprised of just one single crystal (no grain boundaries). Although different square-wave potential programs lead to different types of crystals, the Pt NCs discussed here have a concave hexoctahedral geometry bound primarily by {13 6 2} surface facets. The results in this report represent a first step toward our ultimate goal of studying electrocatalysis at individual, shape-controlled, single-crystal nanoparticles.

Proper anodic catalysis ensures high energy conversion and operation cost of the fuel cell. Although a proton exchange membrane is a successful electrolyte of DMFC, its drawbacks or limitations can be avoided by replacing the solid membrane with a liquid electrolyte that is not subject to evaporation, especially at elevated temperatures. A promising candidate for such electrolyte is an ionic liquid. The performance of the anode catalyst will be affected when the electrolyte has been changed. In our paper, we report a fast Box-Behnken design to identify the most critical factors that would determine the performance of a specific catalyst-platinum-coated gold nanoporous film (PGNF). Our research revealed that the catalytic kinetics is the critical factor for PGNF in aqueous solution electrolyte; while catalyst poisoning was the most critical when the ionic liquid BMImBF(4) was the electrolyte. This example of how statistic tools could be used in the development of fuel cells could be expanded to the studies of other systems.

The lack of lightweight (< 300 mg), high power batteries is a significant constraint to the development of untethered micro-robots, wearable haptics, mobile computing, and biomedical applications. We have developed a laser micro-machining and assembly process which can produce batteries up to 30 times lighter than the lightest high power commercial cell, at comparable power densities (> 1 kW/kg). Our process is versatile and can be adapted to make custom geometries, miniature high voltage cells, and more, all while using a broad range of starting materials. We see this technology as a path to highly versatile miniature power sources, that will enable a wide range of small-scale applications.

These porphyrins were fully characterized by elemental analysis, HRMS-ESI, UV-vis absorption, steady state fluorescence emission, theoretical calculations and electrochemical analysis. Photo-stability and singlet oxygen generation species were also evaluated. Spectroscopic studies and molecular docking calculations evinced the ability of each porphyrin derivatives to establish interactions with calf-thymus DNA (ct-DNA).

The presence of Li+ or Mg2+ cations in the electrolyte determines the type of intermediates and the overpotentials of their formation in a different manner. Based on systematic cyclic voltammetry (CV) and UV/vis investigations, this work reveals how the mutual interplay of the different cations, the electrolyte solvent, and the polysulfide anions is reflected in the electrochemical behavior of "Li2S8"/LiTFSI and "MgS8"/MgTESI2 solutions with dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, dimethoxyethane, tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether, or tetrahydrofuran as solvent. It was observed that the disproportionation reactions of the polysulfides are generally more pronounced and especially the S-3(.-) radical is less stabilized in Mg2+ than in Li+ containing solutions. In contrast to their Li counterparts, the formation of S-4(2-) polysulfides during the reduction of sulfur is not observed in glyme-based Mg polysulfide solutions. Quantum chemical predictions of stability and disproportionation of the Mg/polysulfide/solvent clusters complemented the CV and UV/vis investigations.

Herein, novel 3D edge-enriched Fe3C@C nanocrystals with a core-shell structure grown on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) networks (Fe3C@C/rGO) are reported as highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts for the ORR. The rGO nanosheets act as a host and provide vital support for local growth of edge-enriched Fe3C@C nanocrystals, leading to a large surface area of 263m(2)g(-1) and superstable hybrid structure. The unique structural design of the Fe3C@C/rGO hybrid enables fast mass transport and a substantial number of exposed active edge sites for electrocatalytic reaction. The Fe3C@C/rGO hybrid exhibits excellent ORR catalytic activity, with a high positive onset potential close to 1.0V, a Tafel slope of 65mVdec(-1), and excellent durability with only about 8% current density decay at 0.8V after 20000s continuous operation, which is superior to that of commercial Pt/C catalyst in an alkaline electrolyte.

Updating the Structure and Electrochemistry of LixNiO2 for 0 <= x <= 1	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES; CATHODE MATERIAL; RAY-DIFFRACTION; LINIO2; CELLS; R(3)OVER-BAR-M; MECHANISMS; ELECTRODE; FAILURE	Ni-rich transition metal layered oxide materials are of great interest as positive electrode materials for lithium ion batteries. As the popular electrode materials NMC (LiNi(1-x-y)Mn(x)CoyO(2)) and NCA (LiNi(1-x-y)Mn(x)CoyO(2)) become more and more Ni-rich, they approach LiNiO2. Therefore it is important to benchmark the structure and electrochemistry of state of the art LixNiO2 for the convenience of researchers in the field. In this work, LiNiO2 synthesized from a commercial Ni(OH)(2) precursor and modern synthesis methods shows a specific capacity close to the theoretical specific capacity of 274 mAh/g. In-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were conducted to obtain accurate structural information versus lithium content, x. The known multiple phase transitions of LixNiO2 during charge and discharge were clearly observed, and the variation in unit cell lattice constants and volume was measured. Differential capacity versus voltage (dQ/dV vs. V) studies were used to investigate the electrochemical properties including regions of composition that show very slow kinetics. It is hoped that this work will be a useful reference for those working on Ni-rich positive electrode materials for Li-ion cells. (C) The Author(s) 2018. Published by ECS.

Nitric Oxide Modulates Endonuclease III Redox Activity by a 800 mV Negative Shift upon [Fe4S4] Cluster Nitrosylation	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							DINITROSYL-IRON COMPLEXES; SENSING 4FE-4S CLUSTER; DNA CHARGE-TRANSPORT; REPAIR PROTEINS; MITOCHONDRIAL ACONITASES; ACTIVATED MACROPHAGES; CANCER PROGRESSION; GUANYLATE-CYCLASE; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; EPR	Here we characterize the [Fe4S4] cluster nitrosylation of a DNA repair enzyme, endonuclease III (EndoIII), using DNA-modified gold electrochemistry and protein film voltammetry, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, mass spectrometry of whole and trypsin-digested protein, and a variety of spectroscopies. Exposure of EndoIII to nitric oxide under anaerobic conditions transforms the [Fe4S4] cluster into a dinitrosyl iron complex, [(Cys)(2)Fe(NO)(2)](-), and Roussin's red ester, [(mu-Cys)(2)Fe-2(NO)(4)], in a 1:1 ratio with an average retention of 3.05 +/- 0.01 Fe per nitrosylated cluster. The formation of the dinitrosyl iron complex is consistent with previous reports, but the Roussin's red ester is an unreported product of EndoIII nitrosylation. Hyperfine sublevel correlation (HYSCORE) pulse EPR spectroscopy detects two distinct classes of NO with N-14 hyperfine couplings consistent with the dinitrosyl iron complex and reduced Roussin's red ester. Whole-protein mass spectrometry of EndoIII nitrosylated with (NO)-N-14 and (NO)-N-15 support the assignment of a protein-bound [(mu-Cys)(2)Fe-2(NO)(4)] Roussin's red ester. The [Fe4S4](2+/3+) redox couple of DNA-bound EndoIII is observable using DNA-modified gold electrochemistry, but nitrosylated EndoIII does not display observable redox activity using DNA electrochemistry on gold despite having a similar DNA-binding affinity as the native protein. However, direct electrochemistry of protein films on graphite reveals the reduction potential of native and nitrosylated EndoIII to be 127 +/- 6 and -674 +/- 8 mV vs NHE, respectively, corresponding to a shift of approximately -800 mV with cluster nitrosylation. Collectively, these data demonstrate that DNA-bound redox activity, and by extension DNA-mediated charge transport, is modulated by [Fe4S4] cluster nitrosylation.

Inchworm movement of two rings switching onto a thread by biased Brownian diffusion represent a three-body problem	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						molecular machines; macrocycles; switching; kinetic modeling; Brownian dynamics	HAND-OVER-HAND; CYANOSTAR MACROCYCLES; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; MECHANISM; DRIVEN; MOTION; ANIONS; PSEUDOROTAXANE; RESOLUTION; ROTAXANES	The coordinated motion of many individual components underpins the operation of all machines. However, despite generations of experience in engineering, understanding the motion of three or more coupled components remains a challenge, known since the time of Newton as the "three-body problem." Here, we describe, quantify, and simulate a molecular three-body problem of threading two molecular rings onto a linear molecular thread. Specifically, we use voltage-triggered reduction of a tetrazine-based thread to capture two cyanostar macrocycles and form a [3]pseudorotaxane product. As a consequence of the noncovalent coupling between the cyanostar rings, we find the threading occurs by an unexpected and rare inchworm-like motion where one ring follows the other. The mechanism was derived from controls, analysis of cyclic voltammetry (CV) traces, and Brownian dynamics simulations. CVs from two noncovalently interacting rings match that of two covalently linked rings designed to thread via the inchworm pathway, and they deviate considerably from the CV of a macrocycle designed to thread via a stepwise pathway. Time-dependent electrochemistry provides estimates of rate constants for threading. Experimentally derived parameters (energy wells, barriers, diffusion coefficients) helped determine likely pathways of motion with rate-kinetics and Brownian dynamics simulations. Simulations verified intercomponent coupling could be separated into ring-thread interactions for kinetics, and ring-ring interactions for thermodynamics to reduce the three-body problem to a two-body one. Our findings provide a basis for high-throughput design of molecular machinery with multiple components undergoing coupled motion.

On the Fundamental and Practical Aspects of Modeling Complex Electrochemical Kinetics and Transport	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							CERAMIC FUEL-CELLS; LITHIUM-OXYGEN BATTERIES; TRANSIENT CONDUCTIVITY; CHEMICAL EXPANSION; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; DOPED CERIA; CHARGE; EQUILIBRIUM; CHEMISTRY; METHANE	Numerous technologies, such as batteries and fuel cells, depend on electrochemical kinetics. In some cases, the responsible electrochemistry and charged-species transport is complex. However, to date, there are essentially no general-purpose modeling capabilities that facilitate the incorporation of thermodynamic, kinetic, and transport complexities into the simulation of electrochemical processes. A vast majority of the modeling literature uses only a few (often only one) global charge-transfer reactions, with the rates expressed using Butler-Volmer approximations. The objective of the present paper is to identify common aspects of electrochemistry, seeking a foundational basis for designing and implementing software with general applicability across a wide range of materials sets and applications. The development of new technologies should be accelerated and improved by enabling the incorporation of electrochemical complexity (e.g., multi-step, elementary charge-transfer reactions and as well as supporting ionic and electronic transport) into the analysis and interpretation of scientific results. The spirit of the approach is analogous to the role that Chemkin has played in homogeneous chemistry modeling, especially combustion. The Cantera software, which already has some electrochemistry capabilities, forms the foundation for future capabilities expansion. (C) 2018 The Electrochemical Society.

Layered transition metal (M) oxides NaxMO2 with a two-layer oxygen stacking (P2, 0.6 <= x <= 0.75), are promising candidates. However, the high average metal oxidation state needed during synthesis means that P2 NaxMO2 cathodes often require the introduction of high-valent cations (Mn4+, Ti4+, Sn5+, or Te6+), limiting the cathode's performance. Using a combination of first-principles calculations and experiments, the feasibility of P2 cathodes containing only electrochemically active nickel and cobalt cations is investigated. It is found that P2 NaxNiyCo1-yO2 materials with x = 0.66, 0.75, and 0 <= gamma <= 0.33 are either thermodynamically stable or metastable yet close to the convex hull at typical P2 synthesis temperatures (approximate to 1000 K). It is demonstrated that a novel P2 compound with y = 0.22 and both Ni3+/4+ and Co3+/4+ can be successfully synthesized. It is studied electrochemically and structurally, using in situ and ex situ X-ray diffraction. It is demonstrated that the chemical space of P2 layered compounds is not fully explored yet and that ab initio phase diagrams allow the determination of new high-specific energy positive electrodes to be targeted experimentally.

J	Mori, Y; Young, YN				Mori, Yoichiro; Young, Y-N			From electrodiffusion theory to the electrohydrodynamics of leaky dielectrics through the weak electrolyte limit	JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS			English	Article						drops and bubbles; electrohydrodynamic effects	ELECTRIC-FIELD; LIQUID/LIQUID INTERFACES; DROPS; MODEL; DEFORMATION; SIMULATIONS; FLOW	The Taylor-Melcher (TM) model is the standard model for describing the dynamics of poorly conducting leaky dielectric fluids under an electric field. The TM model treats the fluids as ohmic conductors, without modelling the underlying ion dynamics. On the other hand, electrodiffusion models, which have been successful in describing electrokinetic phenomena, incorporate ionic concentration dynamics. Mathematical reconciliation of the electrodiffusion picture and the TM model has been a major issue for electrohydrodynamic theory. Here, we derive the TM model from an electrodiffusion model in which we explicitly model the electrochemistry of ion dissociation. We introduce salt dissociation reaction terms in the bulk electrodiffusion equations and take the limit in which the salt dissociation is weak; the assumption of weak dissociation corresponds to the fact that the TM model describes poor conductors. Together with the assumption that the Debye length is small, we derive the TM model with or without the surface charge convection term depending upon the scaling of relevant dimensionless parameters. An important quantity that emerges is the Galvani potential (GP), the jump in voltage across the liquid-liquid interface between the two leaky dielectric media; the GP arises as a natural consequence of the interfacial boundary conditions for the ionic concentrations, and is absent under certain parametric conditions. When the GP is absent, we recover the TM model. Our analysis also reveals the structure of the Debye layer at the liquid-liquid interface, which suggests how interfacial singularities may arise under strong imposed electric fields. In the presence of a non-zero GP, our model predicts that the liquid droplet will drift under an imposed electric field, the velocity of which is computed explicitly to leading order.

However, their unstable electrochemistry at high voltages due to complex multiphase evolution in the bulk structure and continuous degradation of the electrolyte-cathode interphase hampers their practical viability. Here, we reveal a dual-stabilization effect of the cation dopants on the evolution of the bulk structure and electrode-electrolyte interphase of a Li-substituted O3-type cathode upon Na (de) intercalation. The incorporation of Li into the transition-metal layer could mitigate the Jahn-Teller distortion of the Ni3+ ion and prevent the loss of active transition-metal ions so that the unfavorable high-voltage phase transition and the degradation of the electrolyte-cathode interphase are suppressed. As a result, the Li-incorporated cathode material displays a high reversible capacity with good high-voltage durability to facilitate its service in high-energy-density SIBs.

The Electrochemistry of Copper Release from Stainless Steels and Its Role in Localized Corrosion	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							ATOMIC-EMISSION SPECTROELECTROCHEMISTRY; INTERMETALLIC COMPOUND; CHLORIDE MEDIA; MNS INCLUSIONS; DISSOLUTION; CU; 304-STAINLESS-STEEL; PROPAGATION; INITIATION; MECHANISM	In this investigation, the role of copper in MnS dissolution was studied in a series of lab-made austenitic stainless steels (SS) with varying Cu content. The base composition of these samples was that of SS 303 and the Cu content was varied between 0.02 and 0.80 wt%. In potentiodynamic polarization experiments, it was found that Cu deposition passivated the MnS inclusions in all except the 0.02 wt% specimen. The critical potential for this passivation, from potentiostatic experiments, was found to be associated with the onset of metastable pitting. The "apparent" pitting potential in the specimen with 0.02 wt% Cu content was approximately 200 mV more negative than the other specimens. This apparent potential was attributed to MnS dissolution, due to a lack of Cu deposition/passivation, and not pitting. With respect to pit repassivation, at concentrations equal to and greater than 0.2 wt% Cu, repassivation potentials were on the order or +0.10 V SCE. In comparison, for the 0.02 wt% Cu specimen, the repassivation potential was less than the OCP (-0.125 V vs. Ag/AgCl) indicating Cu reduction inside the pit plays a role in the measured repassivation potential. Cu release was quantified using a rotating ring disk electrode. In these experiments, oxidation peaks for Cu(I) and Cu(II) were detected. In these experiments Cu was released at low potentials and low, passive, current densities but the resulting near surface concentrations of Cu(I) (0.02 mM) were insufficient to passivate MnS.

However, the synthesis of electrochemically stable red P anodes remains challenging due to a notable volume variation upon (de)sodiation, and limited synthetic methods arising from the low ignition and sublimation temperatures. To address the above problems, we herein successfully develop an industrially adaptable process for scalable synthesis of affordable phosphorus/carbon (APC) anode materials with an excellent electrochemical performance at a significantly reduced cost. The key to our success is a delicately designed, self-organized, strongly interactive porous P/C structure filled with sodium alginate binder, which maintains the structural integrity of anode and enhances the electrical contact of red P upon its volume variation via a dual protection from porous structure and strong surface interactions. The APC anodes hence present ultrahigh initial Coulombic efficiency (86.2%), excellent cycling stability, and superior rate capability. The industrially adaptable process and excellent electrochemical performance endow the novel APC nano/microspheres with promising applications in high-performance Na-ion batteries.

The hypothesis behind the approach is that epitaxial alignment of hydrophobic blocks of surfactant templates induces a consistent, accessible mesophase orientation across a multilayer film, ultimately leading to continuous, vertically aligned pore channels. Characterization using grazing incidence X-ray scattering, scanning electron microscopy, and impedance spectroscopy indicates that the pores are oriented vertically even in relatively thick films (up to 1 mu m). These films contain a combination of amorphous and nanocrystalline anatase titania of value for electrochemical energy storage. When applied as negative electrodes in lithium-ion batteries, a capacity of 254 mAh g(-1) is obtained after 200 cycles for a single-layer TiO2 film prepared on modified substrate, higher than on unmodified substrate or nonporous TiO2 film, due to the high accessibility of the vertically oriented channels in the films. Thicker films on modified substrate have increased absolute capacity because of higher mass loading but a reduced specific capacity because of transport limitations. These results suggest that the multilayer epitaxial approach is a viable way to prepare high capacity TiO2 films with vertically oriented continuous nanopores.

Hydrogen Bonding and Proton Transfer in Aqueous Toluene Microdroplets Studied by Particle Collision Electrochemistry	CHEMELECTROCHEM			English	Article						Emulsion; Hydrogen-bonding; Single droplet; Electrochemistry; Toluene	ORGANIC-REACTIONS; HETEROGENEOUS CATALYSIS; DROPLET COLLISIONS; ADDITION-REACTIONS; APROTIC-SOLVENTS; EMULSION DROPLET; HIGHLY EFFICIENT; MOISTURE-CONTENT; WATER; QUINONES	This report describes hydrogen bonding and protonation in toluene microdroplets (0.4 to 4.0 mu m) dispersed in water. Such effects are revealed by studying the two-electron reduction of tetrachloro-1,4-benzoquinone (TCBQ) trapped inside the toluene droplets using particle collision electrochemistry (PCE). This approach allows interrogation of microscopic particles in Brownian motion colliding with an ultramicroelectrode and can provide information when the collision encounter is coupled to an electrochemical event. Upon addition of acids in homogeneous toluene, the half-wave potential of TCBQ shifts positively (easier reduction), thus implying hydrogen bonding and/or protonation of the reduction product TCBQ(2-). The shift is commensurate to the proton donating capacity of each acid, so that, acetic acid (pK(a)=4.8) displays higher shift than oleic acid (pK(a)=9.9). However, when the reduction takes place inside toluene droplets, the trend is completely reversed and appears to be driven by preferential partition of acetic acid in water, as opposed to the hydrophobic oleic acid. Furthermore, these effects compete with the underlying binding between TCBQ(2-) and the tetraalkyl phosphonium cation of the ionic liquid used to enhance the conductivity of toluene. This work aims to illustrate a subtle, yet consequential effect that emerges from micro-confinement of immiscible phases, as well as the potential of PCE to extract chemical reactivity information at the organic-water interface.

Here, combining atomically resolved structural analysis with density functional theory calculations, we reveal that the formation of intrinsic oxygen vacancies near surface in silver hollandite nanorods modifies the local atomic structure and valence state. These surface reconstructions resulted from oxygen vacancies can significantly affect the diffusion pathways in what are otherwise one-dimensional (1D) tunneled structures. On the basis of energy barrier calculations, we demonstrate that the oxygen vacancies boost ionic transport through the edge sharing MnO6 polyhedra in the a-b plane. Thus, within a single rod different from the inherent 1D tunnel diffusion in the interior, the ionic transport at oxygen vacancy decorated surfaces likely adopts a three-dimensional diffusion pathway including both tunnel and planar diffusion.

Role of Heteroatoms in S,N-Codoped Nanoporous Carbon Materials in CO2 (Photo)electrochemical Reduction	CHEMSUSCHEM			English	Article						carbon dioxide; doping; electrochemistry; nanoporous materials; photochemistry	SURFACE ENERGETICAL HETEROGENEITY; ELECTROCHEMICAL REDUCTION; DOPED CARBON; ELECTROCATALYTIC REDUCTION; SULFUR; PHOTOACTIVITY; ADSORPTION; EFFICIENT; OXIDATION; GRAPHENE	Thiourea-modified wood-based activated carbon materials were evaluated as catalysts for the CO2 electrochemical reduction reaction (CO2ERR). The materials obtained at 950 degrees C showed long-term stability. The results indicated that thiophenic sulfur provides the catalytic activity for CO formation. However, it was not as active for CH4 formation as was pyridinic N. Tafel plots suggested that the nanoporous structure enhanced the kinetics for CO2 reduction. The electric conductivity limited the activity for CO2ERR in the materials modified at 600, 800, and 900 degrees C. The effect of visible light on CO2ERR was also investigated in this study. Upon irradiation, photocurrent was generated, and the current density increased during the CO2 reduction process. Combined with a band-gap alignment, the results indicate that thiophenic S in the carbon matrix contributed to the sample's photoactivity in visible light. These species enhance the overall reduction process, promoting both the hydrogen evolution reaction and CO2 reduction to CO.

However, reliable and efficient methods for the recovery or estimation of network topology remain a challenge due to the tremendous scale of emerging systems (e.g., brain and social networks) and the inherent nonlinearity within and between individual units. We develop a unified, data-driven approach to efficiently infer connections of networks (ICON). We apply ICON to determine topology of networks of oscillators with different periodicities, degree nodes, coupling functions, and time scales, arising in silico, and in electrochemistry, neuronal networks, and groups of mice. This method enables the formulation of these large-scale, nonlinear estimation problems as a linear inverse problem that can be solved using parallel computing. Working with data from networks, ICON is robust and versatile enough to reliably reveal full and partial resonance among fast chemical oscillators, coherent circadian rhythms among hundreds of cells, and functional connectivity mediating social synchronization of circadian rhythmicity among mice over weeks.

Now, the long - and short-range structural evolution of Na2FePO4F during cycling is studied by in situ high-energy X-ray diffraction (XRD), exsitu solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and first-principles DFT calculations. DFT calculations suggest that the intermediate phase, Na1.5FePO4F, adopts the space group of P2(1)/c, which is a subgroup (P2(1)/b11, No. 14) of Pbcn (No. 60), the space group of the starting phase, Na2FePO4F, and this space group provides a good fit to the experimental XRD and NMR results. The two crystallographically unique Na sites in the structure of Na2FePO4F behave differently during cycling, where the Na ions on the Na2 site are electrochemically active while those on the Na1 site are inert. This study determines the structural evolution and the electrochemical reaction mechanisms of Na2FePO4F in a Na-ion battery.

The presence of H2O at the electrolyte/electrode interface plays a key role in assisting Zn2+ diffusion from electrolyte to the surface, while H2O in the lattice structure alters the working potential. More importantly, a dynamic equilibrium between bulk electrode and electrolyte is eventually reached for H2O transport during the charge/discharge cycles, with the water activity serving as the key parameter determining the direction of water movement and the cycling stability.

Internally referenced diffusion-ordered nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (IR-DOSY) was used to determine the diffusion coefficient and coordination ratio, from which the relative solvating power can be easily measured. The higher the relative solvating power of an ethereal solvent, the more severe will be the LiPS dissolution and the lower the coulombic efficiency of the lithium-sulfur battery. A linear relationship was established between the logarithm of relative solvating power of a solvent and the degree of LiPS dissolution, rendering relative solvating power an important parameter in choosing the electrolyte solvent for lithium-sulfur batteries.

Vibrational Spectroscopy of Water with High Spatial Resolution	ADVANCED MATERIALS			English	Article						EELS; liquid cells; nanoscale; spectroscopy; STEM	TRANSMISSION ELECTRON-MICROSCOPY; ENERGY-LOSS; GRAPHENE; EXCITATIONS; DERIVATIVES; EELS	The ability to examine the vibrational spectra of liquids with nanometer spatial resolution will greatly expand the potential to study liquids and liquid interfaces. In fact, the fundamental properties of water, including complexities in its phase diagram, electrochemistry, and bonding due to nanoscale confinement are current research topics. For any liquid, direct investigation of ordered liquid structures, interfacial double layers, and adsorbed species at liquid-solid interfaces are of interest. Here, a novel way of characterizing the vibrational properties of liquid water with high spatial resolution using transmission electron microscopy is reported. By encapsulating water between two sheets of boron nitride, the ability to capture vibrational spectra to quantify the structure of the liquid, its interaction with the liquid-cell surfaces, and the ability to identify isotopes including H2O and D2O using electron energy-loss spectroscopy is demonstrated. The electron microscope used here, equipped with a high-energy-resolution monochromator, is able to record vibrational spectra of liquids and molecules and is sensitive to surface and bulk morphological properties both at the nano- and micrometer scales. These results represent an important milestone for liquid and isotope-labeled materials characterization with high spatial resolution, combining nanoscale imaging with vibrational spectroscopy.

J	Yao, K; Ling, M; Liu, G; Tong, W				Yao, Kang; Ling, Min; Liu, Gao; Tong, Wei			Chemical Reduction Synthesis and Electrochemistry of Si-Sn Nanocomposites as High-Capacity Anodes for Li-Ion Batteries	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article							NEGATIVE ELECTRODE MATERIALS; SILICON NANOWIRES; COMBINATORIAL INVESTIGATIONS; PERFORMANCE; NANOPARTICLES; SYSTEM; ALLOYS; FILMS	Pure Sn and Si-Sn phases are successfully synthesized by a facile and scalable chemical reduction method. The as-produced Si-Sn nanocomposites exhibit excellent cycling stability, as evidenced by a reversible capacity of 700 mAh/g over 200 cycles, due to the exceptional conductivity and ductility of Sn as well as its buffering effect. More specifically, homogeneous mixing between Si and Sn during the liquid phase reaction helps reduce the maximal stress evolved upon electrochemical cycling by confining the expansion of the electrochemically active metal component. Additionally, the chemical reduction method produces small and uniform particles in the final product that are more favorable to Li+ diffusion and tolerant of mechanical stress and strain. Our work demonstrates that the chemical reduction method, free of ultrahigh vacuum and/or temperature, presents a new approach for the development of intermetallic metal anodes through the incorporation of various metal precursors.

The goal of this study is to review the atomic structures and electrochemistry of metallic MoS2, which is essential for a wide range of existing and new enabling technologies. The scope of this paper ranges from the atomic structure, band structure, electrical and optical properties to fabrication methods, and major emerging applications in electrochemical energy storage and energy conversion. This paper also thoroughly covers the atomic structure-properties-application relationships of metallic MoS2. Understanding the fundamental properties of these structures is crucial for designing and manufacturing products for emerging applications. Today, a more holistic understanding of the interplay between the structure, chemistry, and performance of metallic MoS2 is advancing actual applications of this material. This new level of understanding also enables a myriad of new and exciting applications, which motivated this review. There are excellent reviews already on the traditional semiconducting MoS2, and this review, for the first time, focuses on the uniqueness of conducting metallic MoS2 for energy applications and offers brand new materials for clean energy application.

Here, we report our findings in the controlled synthesis of selenium (Se) containing S-rich co-polymers of various compositions as novel cathode materials through a facile inverse vulcanization of S with selenium disulfide (SeS2) and 1,3-diisopropenylbenzene (DIB) as co-monomers. Nuclear magnetic resonance and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results show that divinyl functional groups of DIB were chemically cross-linked with S/SeS2 chain radicals through a ring-opening polymerization. The newly formed bonds of C-S, C-Se, and S-Se in novel S-SeS2-DIB copolymers effectively alleviate the shuttle effects of polysulfides/polyselenides. Furthermore, various electrochemical techniques confirm the positive roles of Se-containing co-polymers in enhancing the electrode reaction kinetics and the formation of stable solid electrolyte interphase layer with low charge-transfer resistance, leading to improved high-rate performances. The as-synthesized co-polymer was then infiltrated into well-interconnected, porous nanocarbon networks (Ketjenblack EC600JD, KB600) to provide effective paths for the fast electron transport. Due to the synergistic combination of chemical and physical confinement of the reaction intermediates during cycling, good reversibility for 500 cycles with a low decay rate of 0.0549% per cycle was achieved at 1000 mA g(-1). These encouraging results suggest that the combination of chemical incorporation of SeS, into S-rich co-polymer and the physical confinement of carbon networks is a promising strategy for advancing Li/S batteries and their viability for practical applications.

Enhanced Stability of the Carba-closo-dodecaborate Anion for High-Voltage Battery Electrolytes through Rational Design	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							MAGNESIUM ELECTROLYTES; ANODIC-OXIDATION; MG BATTERIES; HALIDE FREE; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; 1ST-PRINCIPLES; POTENTIALS; CONTINUUM; SPECTRA; SYSTEMS	Future energy applications rely on our ability to tune liquid intermolecular interactions and achieve designer electrolytes with highly optimized properties. In this work, we demonstrate rational, combined experimental- computational design of a new carba-closo-dodecaborate-based salt with enhanced anodic stability for Mg energy storage applications. We first establish, through a careful examination using a range of solvents, the anodic oxidation of a parent anion, the carba-closo-dodecaborate anion at 4.6 V vs Mg0/2+ (2.0 vs Fc(0/+)), a value lower than that projected for this anion in organic solvent-based electrolytes and lower than weakly associating bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide and tetrafluoroborate anions. Solvents such as acetonitrile, 3-methylsulfolane, and 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol are shown to enable the direct measurement of carba-closo-dodecaborate oxidation, where the resultant neutral radical drives passive film formation on the electrode. Second, we employ computational screening to evaluate the impact of functionalization of the parent anion on its stability and find that replacement of the carbon-vertex proton with a more electronegative fluorine or trifluoromethyl ligand increases the oxidative stability and decreases the contact-ion pair formation energy while maintaining reductive stability. This predicted expansion of the electrochemical window for fluorocarba-closo-dodecaborate is experimentally validated. Future work includes evaluation of the viability of these derivative anions as efficient and stable carriers for energy storage as a function of the ionic transport through the resulting surface films formed on candidate cathodes.

Capacity Retention for (De)lithiation of Silver Containing alpha-MnO2: Impact of Structural Distortion and Transition Metal Dissolution	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							CATHODE MATERIALS; LI-ION; LITHIUM INSERTION; CRYSTALLITE SIZE; HOLLANDITE; BATTERY; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; BETA-MNO2; NANORODS; OXIDES	Crystallite size reduction is a strategy utilized to increase deliverable capacity by decreasing the path length for lithium ion diffusion. However, reduction in crystallite size may also exacerbate unfavorable reactions within a battery limiting cycle life. Here, differences in capacity retention are observed for silver containing alpha-MnO2 (silver hollandite, AgHol), with two crystallite sizes. Under 30 mA/g discharge, the smaller crystallite size material (AgHol-S, 5 nm) delivers 266 mAh/g initial capacity with 91% capacity decrease from cycles 2-50. In contrast, the larger crystallite size material (AgHol-L, 14 nm) has an initial capacity of 129 mAh/g and only 9% decrease from cycles 2-50. A second electrochemical test was conducted using a capacity limit rather than a voltage limit. Under those test conditions, the structural distortion for the two materials observed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was similar, yet the terminal voltage decrease was more significant for the small crystallite sized sample. Determination of Mn dissolution revealed Mn solubility 5.4X higher for AgHol-S than AgHol-L with accompanying higher Mn deposition on the negative electrode and increased cell impedance. This study provides quantitative determination of capacity fade as related to structural distortion and transition metal dissolution as related to crystallite size.

Rhombohedral CuFeO2 0.7-2.5 mu m crystals were obtained by heating an aqueous solution of Fe(NO3)(3), Cu(NO3)(2), and propionaldehyde to 180 degrees C for 2 h in a microwave oven, which enables the synthesis of the CuFeO2 microcrystals with significantly reduced heating time at a mild temperature. The electrode made with the delafossite CuFeO2 discharged at 0.01 V and charged at 1.5 V vs Na+/Na and retained a reversible capacity of 240 mAhg(-1) at a specific current of 0.1 Ag-1 after 200 cycles. The delafossite CuFeO(2 )microcrystals could be a potential anode material for sodium-ion batteries considering the simple synthetic method and acceptable reversible capacity compared to other nanostructured anode materials.

J	Xiao, N; Ren, XD; McCulloch, WD; Gourdin, G; Wu, YY				Xiao, Neng; Ren, Xiaodi; McCulloch, William D.; Gourdin, Gerald; Wu, Yiying			Potassium Superoxide: A Unique Alternative for Metal-Air Batteries	ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH			English	Review							SODIUM-OXYGEN BATTERIES; IMPROVED CYCLE LIFE; K-O-2 BATTERIES; SIDE REACTIONS; LITHIUM SUPEROXIDE; DISCHARGE PRODUCTS; NA-O-2 BATTERIES; LI-O-2 BATTERIES; ALLOY ANODE; CAPACITY	Lithium-oxygen (Li-O-2) batteries have been envisaged and pursued as the long-term successor to Li-ion batteries, due to the highest theoretical energy density among all known battery chemistries. However, their practical application is hindered by low energy efficiency, sluggish kinetics, and a reliance on catalysts for the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER). In a superoxide battery, oxygen is also used as the cathodic active medium but is reduced only to superoxide (O-2(center dot-)), the anion formed by adding an electron to a diatomic oxygen molecule. Therefore, O-2/O-2(center dot-) is a unique single-electron ORR/OER process. Since the introduction of K-O-2 batteries by our group in 2013, superoxide batteries based on potassium superoxide (KO2) have attracted increasing interest as promising energy storage devices due to their significantly lower overpotentials and costs. We have selected potassium for building the superoxide battery because it is the lightest alkali metal cation to form the thermodynamically stable superoxide (KO2) product. This allows the battery to operate through the proposed facile one-electron redox process of O-2/KO2. This strategy provides an elegant solution to the long-lasting kinetic challenge of ORR/OER in metal-oxygen batteries without using any electrocatalysts. Over the past five years, we have been focused on understanding the electrolyte chemistry, especially at the electrode/electrolyte interphase, and the electrolyte's stability in the presence of potassium metal and superoxide. In this Account, we examine our advances and understanding of the chemistry in superoxide batteries, with an emphasis on our systematic investigation of K-O-2 batteries. We first introduce the K metal anode electrochemistry and its corrosion induced by electrolyte decomposition and oxygen crossover. Tuning the electrolyte composition to form a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is demonstrated to alleviate electrolyte decomposition and O-2 cross-talk. We also analyze the nucleation and growth of KO2 in the oxygen electrode, as well its long-term stability. The electrochemical growth of KO2 on the cathode is correlated with the rate performance and capacity. Increasing the surface area and reducing the O-2 diffusion pathway are identified as critical strategies to improve the rate performance and capacity. Li-O-2 and Na-O-2 batteries are further compared with the KO2 chemistry regarding their pros and cons. Because only KO2 is thermodynamically stable at room temperature, K-O-2 batteries offer reversible cathode reactions over the long-term while the counterparts undergo disproportionation. The parasitic reactions due to the reactivity of superoxide are discussed. With the trace side products quantified, the overall superoxide electrochemistry is highly reversible with an extended shelf life. Lastly, potential anode substitutes for K-O-2 batteries are reviewed, including the K3Sb alloy and liquid Na-K alloy. We conclude with perspectives on the future development of the K metal anode interface, as well as the electrolyte and cathode materials to enable improved reversibility and maximized power capability. We hope this Account promotes further endeavors into the development of the K-O-2 chemistry and related material technologies for superoxide battery research.

Analyses of the catalytic cyclic voltammetric profiles have permitted the ORR mechanism to be constructed and rate constants to be extracted for both the formation of the initial oxygen adduct and the O-O bond cleavage event for a series of HAs. The dependence of the formation rate constant of the oxygen adduct on reactant concentrations reveals a rate law that is first order in Mn porphyrin and oxygen substrate. A second order dependence in HA is observed for unadorned Mn porphyrin platforms whereas with Mn hangman porphyrin, a proton is provided intramolecular to the oxygen adduct and consequently the HA order is reduced to unity. The stabilization of the oxygen adduct with an additional hydrogen bond from HA engenders a rate-determining step involving O-O bond cleavage, resulting in the rare instance where the activation of the O-O bond is directly observed.

Asymmetric Nafion-Coated Nanopore Electrode Arrays as Redox-Cycling-Based Electrochemical Diodes	ACS NANO			English	Article						nanoscale electrochemistry; nanopore electrode arrays; redox cycling; ionic diode; Nafion; permselectivity	FIELD-EFFECT TRANSISTORS; LOW IONIC-STRENGTH; NANOFLUIDIC CHANNELS; TRANSPORT; RECTIFICATION; DNA; MONOLAYERS; MEMBRANES; JUNCTION; FILMS	Inspired by the functioning of cellular ion channels, pore-based structures with nanoscale openings have been fabricated and integrated into ionic circuits, for example, ionic diodes and transistors, for signal processing and detection. In these systems, the nonlinear current responses arise either because asymmetric nanopore geometries break the symmetry of the ion distribution, creating unequal surface charge across the nanopore, or by coupling unidirectional electron transfer within a nanopore electrode. Here we develop a high-performance redox-cycling-based electrochemical diode by coating an asymmetric ion-exchange membrane, that is, Nafion, on the top surface of a nanopore electrode array (Nafion@NEA), in which each pore in the array exhibits one or more annular electrodes. Nafion@NEAs exhibit highly sensitive and charge-selective electroanalytical measurements due to efficient redox-cycling reaction, the permselectivity of Nafion, and the strong confinement of redox species in the nanopore array. In addition, the top electrode of dual-electrode Nafion@NEAs can serve as a voltage-controlled switch to gate ion transport within the nanopore. Thus Nafion@NEAs can be operated as a diode by switching voltages applied to the top and bottom electrodes of the NEA, leading to a large rectification ratio, fast response times, and simplified circuitry without the need for external electrodes. By taking advantage of closely spaced and individually addressable electrodes, the redox-cycling electrochemical diode has the potential for application to large-scale production and electrochemically controlled circuit operations, which go well beyond conventional electronic diodes or transistors.

Electrochemistry on Stretchable Nanocomposite Electrodes: Dependence on Strain	ACS NANO			English	Article						stretchable materials; biomimetic electronics; reconfigurable electrodes; electrochemical sensors; implantable devices; self-assembly	HIGH-PERFORMANCE; GOLD ELECTRODES; IMPEDANCE; SKIN; TRANSPARENT; COMPOSITES; CONDUCTORS; MORPHOLOGY; MECHANICS; BEHAVIOR	Stretchable nanocomposite conductors are essential for engineering of bio-inspired deformable electronics, human-machine interfaces, and energy storage devices. While the effect of strain on conductivity for stretchable conductors has been thoroughly investigated, the strain dependence of multiple other electrical-transport processes and parameters that determine the functionalities and biocompatibility of deformable electrodes has received virtually no attention. The constancy of electrochemical parameters at electrode-fluid interfaces such as redox potentials, impedances, and charge-transfer rate constants on strain is often tacitly assumed. However, it remains unknown whether these foundational assumptions actually hold true for deformable electrodes. Furthermore, it is also unknown whether the previously used charge-transport circuits describing electrochemical processes on rigid electrodes are applicable to deformable electrodes. Here, we investigate the validity of the strain invariability assumptions for an elastic composite electrode based on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). A comprehensive model of electrode reactions that accurately describes electrochemical processes taking place on nanocomposite electrodes for ferro-/ferricyanide electrochemicals pair at different strains is developed. Unlike rigid gold electrodes, the model circuit for stretchable electrodes is comprised of two parallel impedance segments describing (a) diffusion and redox processes taking place on the open surface of the composite electrode and (b) redox processes that occur in nanopores. AuNPs forming the open-surface circuit support the redox process, whereas those forming the nanopores only increase the double-layer capacitance. The redox potential was found to be strain-independent for tensile deformations as high as 40%. Other parameters, however, display strong strain dependence, exemplified by the 2-2.5 and 27 times increases of active area of the open and nanopore surface area, respectively, after application of 40% strain. Gaining better understanding of the strain-dependent and -independent electrochemical parameters enables both fundamental and practical advances in technologies based on deformable electrodes.

Here we report a proof-of-concept fabrication methodology of a multifunctional film that allows established methods from bacterial recognition (antibodies) and nanotechnology (magnetic nanoparticles) to be coupled with electrochemical signal processing methods for detection of viable bacteria. Specifically, we enlist a sequence of externally applied electrical and magnetic signals to: i) guide the self-assembly of stimuli-responsive biopolymer; ii) incorporate magnetic nanoparticles to form a magnetic layer; iii) electro-synthesize a signal processing layer (redox-capacitor). The function of the magnetic layer is collecting and concentrating MMP-bacteria through magnetic attractions between MMP-bacteria and the magnetic layer. The function of the signal processing layer is amplifying electrochemical detection of the collected bacteria by engaging the redox-active mediators with the redox capacitor. Importantly, the fabrication demonstrated here is simple, controllable, and reagentless.

Here we report a double perovskite PrBa0.8Ca0.2Co2O5+ (PBCC) cathode with excellent ORR activity and remarkable CO2 tolerance under realistic operation conditions. When tested in a symmetrical cell in air with similar to 1 vol% CO2 at 750 degrees C, the PBCC electrode shows an area specific resistance of similar to 0.024 Omega cm(2), which increases to 0.028 Omega cm(2) after 1000 h operation. The degradation rate is similar to 1/24 of that of the state-of-the-art La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF) cathode under the same conditions. Impedance spectroscopy and in situ surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy analyses indicate that the surface of the PBCC electrode is much more active for oxygen exchange and more robust against CO2 than that of LSCF, as confirmed by density functional theory calculations. The fast ORR kinetics and excellent durability of PBCC in air with CO2 highlight the potential of PBCC as a highly promising material for devices involving oxygen electrochemistry such as solid oxide fuel cells, electrolysis cells, or gas separation membranes.

An Easily Fabricated Low-Cost Potentiostat Coupled with User-Friendly Software for Introducing Students to Electrochemical Reactions and Electroanalytical Techniques	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						Upper-Division Undergraduate; Analytical Chemistry; Hands-On Learning/Manipulatives; Electrochemistry; Oxidation/Reduction; Laboratory Equipment/Apparatus		This paper presents a teaching kit that combines the fabrication of a low-cost microcontroller-based potentiostat and a LabVIEW-generated graphical user interface. The potentiostat enables undergraduate-level students to learn electroanalytical techniques and characterize energy conversion devices such as solar cells. The purpose of this teaching module is to make the introduction of electrochemistry accessible to undergraduate laboratories, especially those with limited financial resources and without expertise in electronics or programming. The electronic circuit components for the potentiostat are readily available and easy to assemble. The graphical user interface replaces any programming-based interface, displays data in real time, and interacts with user commands. The software package is a stand-alone executable file that is compatible with any PC and is provided in the Supporting Information. Cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry, and chronoamperometry functions are demonstrated with representative electrochemical experiments, and the data obtained are comparable to those obtained with a research-grade potentiostat. This teaching module is user-friendly so that it can be easily adapted into the undergraduate classroom. We make available in the Supporting Information all of the necessary instructions and information, including schematics for the potentiostat, circuit layout, electronic components, case fabrication, step-by-step instructions for assembly, software user interface, and detailed operating instructions.

Electrochemistry of N-confused inner amino-substituted free-base tetraarylporphyrins in nonaqueous media	JOURNAL OF PORPHYRINS AND PHTHALOCYANINES			English	Article						N-confused inner amino-substituted porphyrin; electrochemistry; spectroelectrochemistry; substituent effect	METAL-COMPLEXES; PORPHYRIN; CHEMISTRY; TETRAPHENYLPORPHYRIN; PROTONATION/DEPROTONATION; SPECTROELECTROCHEMISTRY; COORDINATION; CORROLES; ISOMER; CU(II)	Four N-confused free-base tetraarylporphyrins containing an amino group on the inner carbon of the inverted pyrrole were synthesized and characterized as to their electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical properties in dichloromethane and N,N-dimethylformamide containing 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium perchlorate as supporting electrolyte. The examined compounds are represented as (NH2)(Ar)(4)NcpH(2), where "Ncp" is the N-confused porphyrin macrocycle and Ar is a p-CH3 OPh, p-CH3Ph, Ph or p-ClPh substituent on each meso-position of the macrocycle. Each porphyrin undergoes multiple irreversible reductions and oxidations. The first one-electron addition and first one-electron abstraction are located on the porphyrin pi-ring system to give pi-anion and pi-cation radicals with a HOMO-LUMO gap ranging from 1.21 to 1.34 V in CH2Cl2 and 1.06 to 1.12 V in DMF. Both electrogenerated products are unstable and undergo a rapid chemical reaction to give new electroactive species which can be further reduced at more negative potentials or further oxidized at more positive potentials. The effects of the inner amino-substituent on the UV-vis spectra and electrochemical properties of the porphyrin are discussed, and comparisons made to data in the literature for both structurally related N-confused porphyrins containing an inner carbon NO2 group and derivatives without the inner substituent.

The early stages of FeCO3 scale formation kinetics in CO2 corrosion	MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article						CO2 corrosion; FeCO3 nucleation and growth; Precipitation kinetics; X65 carbon steel	CARBON-DIOXIDE CORROSION; MILD-STEEL; MODEL; OIL	In a carbon dioxide (CO2) corrosive environment, when the product of the local concentrations of iron (Fe2+) and carbonate (CO32-) ions exceed the solubility limit, the precipitation of iron carbonate (FeCO3) on the internal walls of carbon steel pipelines can significantly reduce the corrosion rate. In the following work, static glass cell corrosion experiments were conducted to understand the precipitation behavior in the early stages of FeCO3 development and the factors favorable to protective film formation. The corrosion and precipitation rates were followed using a combination of mass gain, mass loss, electrochemistry and surface analysis techniques. At the conditions studied, the protectiveness and the rate of film formation was observed to vary significantly. The results indicated that the early stages of FeCO3 precipitation consists of a complex simultaneous nucleation and growth process. FeCO3 precipitation is shown to be dependent on surface species concentrations which can be significantly different to that of the bulk solution. Additionally, the role of crystal surface coverage and the blocking of actively corroding sites on the steel surface is examined and is shown to play a critical role in reducing precipitation kinetics at low levels of bulk super-saturation.

Recent fast development of in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) technique makes it achievable to better understand the corrosion mechanism and physicochemical processes at the interfaces between samples and gases or electrolytes by dynamical capture the microstructural and chemical changes with high resolution within a realistic or near-realistic environment. However, a detailed and in-depth account summing up the development and latest achievements of in situ TEM techniques, especially the application of emerging liquid and electrochemical cells in the community of corrosion study in the last several years is lacking and is urgently needed for its heathy development. To fill this gap, this critical review summarizes firstly the key scientific issues in corrosion research, followed by introducing the configurations of several typical closed-type cells. Then, the achievements of in situ TEM using open-type or closed-type cells in corrosion study are presented in detail. The study directions in the future are commented finally in terms of spatial and temporal resolution, electron radiation, and linkage between microstructure and electrochemical performance in corrosion community.

However, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells via a fast four-electron path usually uses at least two Pt atoms, which cannot be realized in highly isolated single Pt atoms. The synthesis of a densely dispersed single atom catalyst with adjacent atoms accessible at the same time on a matrix with a high surface area provides a feasible way and, however, is challenging. Here, we synthesize ultrathin FePt nanosheets (NSs) with 6.7 wt % neighboring dispersed Pt atoms. Different from the reported isolated Pt single atom catalysts, these ultrathin wrinkled FePt NSs with neighboring Pt sites adopt a four-electron reduction pathway, a high electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of 545.54 m(2) g(Pt)(-1), and an improved mass activity 7 times as high as Pt/C in the ORR. The improved performance results from the optimal use of neighboring Pt atoms dispersed in a more packed spacing and exposed on the surface of ultrathin sheets. The Pt atoms can interact synergistically to catalyze a fast ORR process. Furthermore, both the experiment and density functional theory (DFT) calculation indicated an outstanding CO-tolerance performance of this catalyst in the ORR	[Chen, Wenlong; Robert, Tom; Ma, Yanling; Shan, Hao; Gu, Xin; Shang, Wen; Tao, Peng; Song, Chenyi; Deng, Tao; Wu, Jianbo] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Met Matrix Composites, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Gao, Wenpei; Pan, Xiaoqing] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Chem Engn & Mat Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Tu, Peng; Zhu, Hong] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Univ Michigan Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ Joint Inst, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Pan, Xiaoqing] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Phys & Astron, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Yang, Hong] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Roger Adams Lab 206, MC-712,600 South Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Chen, Wenlong; Ma, Yanling; Shan, Hao; Deng, Tao; Wu, Jianbo] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Hydrogen Sci Res Ctr, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China	Wu, JB (reprint author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Met Matrix Composites, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.; Pan, XQ (reprint author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Chem Engn & Mat Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.; Zhu, H (reprint author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Univ Michigan Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ Joint Inst, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.; Pan, XQ (reprint author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Phys & Astron, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.; Zhu, H; Wu, JB (reprint author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Hydrogen Sci Res Ctr, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.	hong.zhu@sjtu.edu.cn; xiaoqing.pan@uci.edu; jianbowu@sjtu.edu.cn		Shang, Wen/0000-0002-6984-3060; Gao, Wenpei/0000-0002-2776-2676	thousand talents program for distinguished young scholars from the Chinese government; National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFB0406000]; National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [51521004, 51420105009]; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CBET 1159240, DMR-1420620, DMR-1506535]	The work is sponsored by the thousand talents program for distinguished young scholars from the Chinese government, the National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFB0406000), and the National Science Foundation of China (51521004 and 51420105009) and the start-up fund (J.W.) and the Zhi-Yuan Endowed fund (T.D.) from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

Crystal structure and redox potentials of the tppz-bridged {RuCl(bpy)}(+) dimer	ACTA CRYSTALLOGRAPHICA SECTION E-CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						crystal structure; dinuclear complex; electrochemistry; tetra(pyridyl)pyrazine; ruthenium precatalyst	ELECTRONIC-PROPERTIES; DINUCLEAR RUTHENIUM; COMPLEXES; LIGANDS	We report the structural and electrochemical characterization of the binuclear complex [mu-(C24H16N6){RuCl(C10H8N2)}(2)](PF6)(2), which contains the bis-tridentate bridging ligand 2,3,5,6-tetrakis(pyridin-2-yl) pyrazine (tppz), the monodentate ligand Cl- and the bidentate ligand 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy) {systematic name: mu-2,3,5,6-tetrakis(pyridin-2-yl)pyrazine-bis[(2,2'-bipyridine) chloridoruthenium(II)]bis(hexafluoridophosphate)}. The complete [(bpy)(Cl) Ru(tppz)Ru(Cl)(bpy)](2+) dication is generated by crystallographic twofold symmetry; the tppz bridging ligand has a significantly twisted conformation, with an average angle of 42.4 degrees between the mean planes of adjacent pyridyl rings. The metalcoordinated chloride ligands are in a trans configuration relative to each other across the {Ru(tppz) Ru} unit. The Ru-II ion exhibits a distorted octahedral geometry due to the restricted bite angle [160.6 (3)degrees] of the tppz ligand. For bpy, the bond lengths of the Ru-N bonds are 2.053 (8) and 2.090 (8) angstrom, with the shorter bond being opposite to Ru-Cl. For the tridentate tppz, the Ru-N distances involving the outer N atoms trans to each other are 2.069 (8) and 2.072 (9) angstrom, whereas the Ru-N bond involving the central N atom has the much shorter length of 1.939 (7) angstrom as a result of the geometric constraints and stronger pi-acceptor ability of the pyrazine-centered bridge. The Ru-Cl distance is 2.407 (3) angstrom and the intramolecular distance between Ru centers is 6.579 (4) angstrom. In the crystal, weak C-H center dot center dot center dot Cl and C-H center dot center dot center dot F interactions consolidate the packing.

DRILL Interface Makes Ion Soft Landing Broadly Accessible for Energy Science and Applications	BATTERIES & SUPERCAPS			English	Article						deposition; electrochemistry; electron microscopy; energy storage; soft landing	IONIZATION-MASS-SPECTROMETRY; CATALYSIS; CLUSTER; SURFACES; COLLISIONS	Polyoxometalates (POM) have been deposited onto carbon nanotube (CNT) electrodes using benchtop ion soft landing (SL) enabled by a vortex-confined electrohydrodynamic desolvation process. The device is based on the dry ion localization and locomotion (DRILL) mass spectrometry interface of Fedorov and co-workers. By adding electrospray emitters, heating the desolvation gas, and operating at high gas flow rates, it is possible to obtain stable ion currents up to -15 nA that are ideal for deposition. Coupled with ambient ion optics, this interface enables desolvated ions to be delivered to surfaces while excluding solvent and counterions. Electron microscopy of surfaces prepared using the device reveal discrete POM and no aggregation that degrades electrode performance. Characterization of POM-coated CNT electrodes in a supercapacitor showed an energy storage capacity similar to that achieved with SL in vacuum. For solutions that produce primarily a single ion by electrospray ionization, benchtop SL offers a simpler and less costly approach for surface modification with applications in catalysis, energy storage, and beyond.

We report the fabrication of graphene nanosheets by spontaneous electrochemical reaction using solvated ion intercalation into graphite. The current literature focuses on the fabrication of graphene using lithium metal. Our procedure uses sodium metal, which results in a reduction of costs. Using various characterization techniques, we confirmed the fabrication of graphene nanosheets. We obtained an intensity ratio (I-D/I-G) of 0.32 using Raman spectroscopy, interlayer spacing of 0.39 nm and our XPS results indicate that our fabricated compound is relatively oxidation free.

The large MC is ascribed to spin-dependent oxidation of oxalate. Both singlet and triplet radical pairs are generated during the electrochemical oxidation of oxalate. An applied magnetic field could accelerate the spin evolution of a singlet radical pair into its triplet state. The triplet radical pair has a much larger dissociation probability than the singlet radical pair because of the Pauli exclusion principle. Thus, enhancing the triplet yield could largely increase the oxidation rate of oxalate and generate significant MC. The significant MC effect provides a new approach to study spin evolution of radical pairs in electrochemical cells. Furthermore, an effective analytical method for oxalate determination can be developed based on the significant MC effect.

Contrary to the conventional approach, we propose herein that the electro-chemistry-coupled and microstructure-mediated cross talk between the positive and negative electrodes ultimately dictates the off-equilibrium-coupled processes, such as heat generation and the propensity for lithium plating. The active particle morphological differences between the electrode couple foster a thermo-electrochemical hysteresis, where the difference in heat generation rates changes the electrochemical response. The intrinsic asymmetry in electrode microstructural complexations leads to thermo-electrochemical consequences, such as cathode dependent thermal excursion and co-dependent lithium plating otherwise believed to be anode-dependent.

First-principles DFT calculations for the model systems M = Co and M = Mn0.5Ni0.5 provide insights into the atomic-scale transformations in the bulk during the first charge and discharge of LRLO. The simulations were performed with the VASP code at the GGA+ U level. Molecular dynamics simulations were conducted at T = 1000 K (charge) and 2000 K (discharge) to accelerate the dynamics. Considerable Co migration to the Li layer occurs during the first charge for the system with M = Co, but the LiMO2 component remains substantially intact for the system with M = Mn0.5Ni0.5. First-charge oxygen dimerization in the M = Co system occurs in both the LiMO2 and the Li2MnO3 components of the material, and exceeds than for M = Mn0.5Ni0.5, where dimerization is essentially confined to the Li2MnO3 component. About half of the oxygen dimers created during the voltage plateau dissociate during the first discharge. Analysis of the redox suggests that someMn(3+) is generated during the first charge for the system M = Co. (C) 2018 The Electrochemical Society.

Role of Photogenerated Iodine on the Energy-Conversion Properties of MoSe2 Nanoflake Liquid Junction Photovoltaics	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						microscopy; two-dimensional materials; solar cells; photocurrent mapping; photoelectrocatalysis	POLYCRYSTALLINE THIN-FILMS; WSE2; EFFICIENCY; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; ELECTRODES; N-MOSE2; P-WSE2; LAYER; PHOTOELECTROCHEMISTRY; N-WSE2	Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as MoSe2 and WSe2 are efficient materials for converting solar energy to electrical energy in photoelectrochemical photovoltaic cells. One limiting factor of these liquid junction solar cells is that photogenerated oxidation products accumulate on the electrode surface and decrease the photocurrent efficiency. However, it is unclear where the reaction products accumulate on the electrode surface and how they impact the local photoelectrochemical response. This open question is especially important for the structurally heterogeneous TMD nanoflake thin-film electrodes that are promising for large-area solar energy conversion applications. Here, we use a single-nanoflake photoelectrochemical and Raman microscopy approach to probe how the photogenerated I-2/I-3(-) products impact the photocurrent collection efficiency and the onset potential in MoSe2-nanoflakel I-F/I2IPt photoelectrochemical solar cells. We observed localized I-2/I-3(-) deposition on all types of MoSe2 nanoflake surface motifs, including basal planes, perimeter edges, and interior step edges. Illuminated nanoflake spots with the highest photocurrent collection efficiency are the first to be limited by I-2/I-3(-) formation under high-intensity illumination. Interestingly, I-2/I-3(-) formation occurs on illuminated surface spots that have the lowest photocurrent onset potential for iodide oxidation, corresponding to the highest open circuit voltage (V-OC). The V-OC shifts could be attributed to variations in the surface reaction kinetics or doping density across the nanoflake. Our results highlight important limiting factors of nanoflake thin-film TMD liquid junction photovoltaics under concentrated solar illumination intensities.

Bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI-) has been recognized as a "magic anion" for passivating alkali metals. The KFSI-dimethoxyethane electrolyte passivates the potassium metal anode by cleavage of S-F bonds and the formation of a KF-rich solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI). However, the KFSI salt is chemically unstable owing to nucleophilic attack by superoxide and/or hydroxide species. On the other hand, potassium bis(trifluorosulfonyl)imide (KTFSI) is stable to KO2, but results in mossy potassium deposits and irreversible plating and stripping. To circumvent this dilemma, we developed an artificial SEI for the metal anode and thus long-cycle-life K-O-2 batteries. This study will guide the development of stable electrolytes and artificial SEIs for metal-O-2 batteries.

Synthesis and Characterization of Neutral Ligand alpha-Diirnine Complexes of Aluminum with Tunable Redox Energetics	INORGANIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article							DIIMINE COMPLEXES; OXIDATION; ME; COORDINATION; REACTIVITY; SERIES; BU	The synthesis and full characterization of a series of neutral ligand alpha-diimine complexes of aluminum are reported. The compounds [Al (L-Ar)(2)Cl-2)] [AlCl4] [L-Ar = N,N'-bis (4-R-C6H4)-2,3-dimethyl-1,4-diaza-butadiene] are structurally analogous, as determined by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and solid-state X-ray diffraction, across a range of electron-donating [R = Me (2), Bu-t (3), OMe (4), and NMe2 (5)] and electron-withdrawing [R = Cl (6), CF3 (7), and NO2 (8)] substituents in the aryl side arm of the ligand. UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and electrochemistry were used to access the optical and electrochemical properties, respectively, of the complexes. Both sets of properties are shown to be dependent on the R substituent.

The Soret maxima of Mn[TpXPC]Cl (TpXPC = mesotris(p-X-phenyl)corrole, where X = CF3, H, Me, and OMe) were found to red shift over a range of 37 nm with increasing electron-donating character of X. For Mn[TpXPC]Ph, in contrast, the complex Soret envelopes were found to be largely independent of X. These observations suggested a noninnocent corrole center dot(2-)-like ligand for the MnCl complexes and an innocent corrole(3-) ligand for the MnPh complexes. Single-crystal X-ray structures of three Mn[TpXPC]Cl complexes revealed skeletal bond-length alternations indicative of a noninnocent corrole, while no such alternation was observed for Mn[TpOMePC]Ph. B3LYP density functional theory (DFT) calculations on Mn[TPC]Cl yielded strong spatial separation of the alpha and beta spin densities, consistent with an antiferromagnetically coupled Mn-III-corrole(center dot 2-) description. By comparison, relatively little spatial separation of the alpha and beta spin densities was found for Mn[TPC]Ph, consistent with an essentially Mn-IV-corrole(3-)description. X-ray absorption of near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) revealed a moderate blue shift of 0.6 eV for the Mn K-pre-edge of Mn[TpCF(3)PC]Ph and a striking enhancement of the pre-edge intensity, relative to Mn[TpCF3PC]Cl, consistent with a more oxidized, i.e., Mn-IV, center in Mn[TpCF(3)PC]Ph. Time-dependent DFT calculations indicated that the enhanced intensity of the Mn K-pre-edge of Mn[TpCF3PC]Ph results from the extra 3dz hole, which mixes strongly with the Mn 4p(z) orbital. Combined with similar results on Fe[TPC]Cl and Fe[TPC]Ph, the present study underscores the considerable potential of metal K-edge XANES in probing ligand noninnocence in first-row transition-metal corroles. Cyclic voltammetry measurements revealed highly negative first reduction potentials for the Mn[TpXPC]Ph series (similar to-0.95 V) as well as large electrochemical HOMO-LUMO gaps of similar to 1.7 V. The first reductions, however, are irreversible, suggesting cleavage of the Mn-Ph bond.

J	Ma, YX; Highsmith, AL; Hill, CM; Pan, SL				Ma, Yanxiao; Highsmith, Alton L.; Hill, Caleb M.; Pan, Shanlin			Dark-Field Scattering Spectroelectrochemistry Analysis of Hydrazine Oxidation at Au Nanoparticle-Modified Transparent Electrodes	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							SINGLE GOLD NANORODS; PLASMON RESONANCE; ELECTROGENERATED CHEMILUMINESCENCE; ANION ADSORPTION; PLATINUM; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; MICROSCOPY; HYDROGEN; EVENTS; CARBON	Au nanoparticles (NPs) have interesting optical properties, such as local field enhancement for improving light absorption and Raman scattering cross-section of an organic chromophore, and catalytic properties of improving the kinetics of redox reactions involved in clean energy transformations. Real-time electrochemical measurements of catalytic Au NPs would help resolve their local structure-function relationship, which can further provide insights into developing an optimal catalytic condition. It is extremely challenging to resolve the electrochemical events of electrocatalytic Au NPs at a single-particle level using conventional ensemble averaging methods. Here, we present a light-scattering-based spectroelectrochemistry analysis of single catalytic Au NPs at a transparent planar electrode and ultramicroelectrode (UME) with combined methods of electrochemistry and dark-field light scattering (DFS). Hydrazine oxidation reaction is used as a model system to characterize the catalytic characteristics of single Au NPs. Real-time light-scattering responses of Au NPs to surface adsorbates, Au oxide formation, double-layer charging, and nitrogen bubble formation upon hydrazine oxidation are investigated for both ensemble and single Au NPs. Such a light-scattering response to catalytic hydrazine oxidation at single Au NPs is highly sensitive to Au NP sizes. The DFS study of single Au NPs shows a minor decrease in the light-scattering signal in the low overpotential region because of the double-layer charging in the absence of hydrazine and the surface adsorbates N2H3 in the presence of hydrazine. A significant decrease in the DFS signal of Au NPs upon Au oxidation in the high-overpotential region can be obtained in the absence of hydrazine. Such an oxide-induced light-scattering signal loss effect can be weakened in the presence of hydrazine and completely eliminated in the presence of >50 mM hydrazine. Strong light scattering can be obtained because of nitrogen bubble formation on the Au NP surface. Theoretical modeling with COMSOL Multiphysics is applied to support the abovementioned conclusions.

The effects of ultrasonic intensities on microstructure, chemical composition, nanomechanical and corrosion properties of the obtained coatings were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), nanoindenter, and electrochemistry. Ni-doped TiN coatings deposited at 20 W/cm(2) showed fine and compact morphologies, with large amounts of TiN particles evenly embedded in the coatings. The average atomic percents of Ti and N elements in the coatings were estimated to approximately 17.3 at% and 24.8 at%, respectively. In addition, the Ni-doped TiN coating produced at 20 W/cm(2) revealed fine, uniform, and exiguous structures in the micro areas. The average diameters of TiN nanoparticles and Ni grains were estimated to around 32.3 nm and 71.8 nm, respectively. The maximum Young's modulus and microhardness values of Ni-doped TiN coatings produced at 20 W/cm(2) were measured as 167.8 and 34.3 GPa, respectively. Also, the Ni-doped TiN coating obtained at 20 W/cm(2) presented the highest R-t and lowest C-d values, indicating superior corrosion resistance and smooth surface coating.

Spectroscopic results demonstrated that the original structure of Hb was unchanged after mixed with B-GQDs, indicating the biocompatibility of B-GQDs. Electrochemical behaviors of Nafion/Hb/B-GQDs/CILE were investigated in pH 4.0 phosphate buffer solution and a couple of well-distinct symmetric redox peaks appeared on cyclic voltammograms. The results were also compared with GQDs and nitrogen-doped GQDs modified electrodes, which illustrated the enhanced effects of B-GQDs to electron communication and loading capability of Hb on the electrode surface due to its high conductivity and small size. Electrochemical kinetics were studied with the electrochemical parameters calculated. Electrocatalysis of Hb and B-GQDs modified electrode to various substrates such as trichloroacetic acid, sodium nitrite and hydrogen peroxide were carefully investigated. This new Hb modified electrode exhibited the advantages of large linear relationship, high sensitivity, low detection limit, good anti-interference ability and excellent stability, which found wide applications in food and drug samples detection.

This paper presents a systematic approach based on the artificial neural network to reduce the computational burden of battery design by several orders-of-magnitude. Two neural networks are constructed using the finite element simulation results from a thermo-electrochemical model. The first neural network serves as a classifier to predict whether a set of input variables is physically feasible. The second neural network yields specific energy and specific power. Both neural networks are validated using extra finite element simulations out of the training data. With a global sensitivity analysis using the neural network, we quantify the effect of input variables on specific energy and specific power by evaluating large combinations of input variables, which is computationally prohibitive for finite element simulations. Among all parameters, the applied C-rate has the largest influence on specific power, while the electrode thickness and porosity are the dominant factors affecting specific energy. Based on this finding, we generate a design map that fulfills the requirements of both specific energy and specific power. Inparticular, we highlight the value of neural network in handling the non-linear, complex and computationally expensive problem of battery design and optimization.

A dextrin/peptone mixture was fed at a range of organic loading rates (0.34 to 1.37 g COD/L-d). The hybrid system with both suspended biomass and biofilm without any external potential application achieved a substantially higher initial soluble COD consumption (53.7 +/- 2.3% vs. 39.7 +/- 3.7) and methane (CH4) production (331 vs. 225 mL) within one day of feeding than the conventional AD system (suspended biomass only). Compared to the conventional AD system, the hybrid systems had higher resilience to shock organic loadings. A range of external potential (0.5 to 2.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl) was applied to AD-BEC reactors, developed with two different start-up procedures. A potential of 2.0 V resulted in water electrolysis leading to a higher CH4 production rate (105 vs. 84 mL/L-d) and biogas CH4 content (88.5 +/- 1.4 vs. 64.5 +/- 1.9%) in the AD-BEC reactor (closed vs. open circuit condition, respectively). Application of external potential enriched putative exoelectrogens at the anode biofilm and hydrogenotrophic methanogens at the cathode biofilm, which may have contributed to the observed enhanced CH4 production in the AD-BEC system. A phylotype related to Methanobacterium formicicum, a hydrogenotrophic methanogen, dominated the archaeal community in the AD-BEC cathode biofilm. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Going beyond Structure: Nickel-Substituted Rubredoxin as a Mechanistic Model for the [NiFe] Hydrogenases	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							COUPLED ELECTRON-TRANSFER; CYTOCHROME-C-OXIDASE; ACTIVE-SITE MODELS; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; OXYGEN-TOLERANT; CATALYTIC BIAS; H-2 OXIDATION; BASIS-SETS; COBALT; COMPLEXES	Well-defined molecular systems for catalytic hydrogen production that are robust, easily generated, and active under mild aqueous conditions remain underdeveloped. Nickel-substituted rubredoxin (NiRd) is one such system, featuring a tetrathiolate coordination environment around the nickel center that is identical to the native [NiFe] hydrogenases and demonstrating hydrogenase-like proton reduction activity. However, until now, the catalytic mechanism has remained elusive. In this work, we have combined quantitative protein film electrochemistry with optical and vibrational spectroscopy, density functional theory calculations, and molecular dynamics simulations to interrogate the mechanism of H-2 evolution by NiRd. Proton-coupled electron transfer is found to be essential for catalysis. The coordinating thiolate ligands serve as the sites of protonation, a role that remains debated in the native [NiFe] hydrogenases, with reduction occurring at the nickel center following protonation. The rate-determining step is suggested to be intramolecular proton transfer via thiol inversion to generate a Ni-III-hydride species. NiRd catalysis is found to be completely insensitive to the presence of oxygen, another advantage over the native [NiFe] hydrogenase enzymes, with potential implications for membrane-less fuel cells and aerobic hydrogen evolution. Targeted mutations around the metal center are seen to increase the activity and perturb the rate determining process, highlighting the importance of the outer coordination sphere. Collectively, these results indicate that NiRd evolves H-2 through a mechanism similar to that of the [NiFe] hydrogenases, suggesting a role for thiolate protonation in the native enzyme and guiding rational optimization of the NiRd system.

Quantifying gas generation from slurries used in fabrication of Si-containing electrodes for lithium-ion cells	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Silicon; Archimedes; Hydrogen; Polyacrylate binders; Electrochemistry	SILICA GLASS; ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCE; COMPOSITE ELECTRODES; AQUEOUS SLURRIES; HIGH-CAPACITY; WATER; BINDERS; STABILITY; DIFFUSION	The high capacity of silicon motivates its use as anode material for Li-ion batteries. While such Si-based electrodes are typically processed from aqueous slurries, elemental silicon is highly susceptible to hydrolysis, yielding flammable hydrogen gas as a byproduct. This gassing can present numerous safety and quality concerns for scaling up of the production. In this study we describe a method to quantify the volume of gases generated using the Archimedes principle. We show that the gas volumes are affected by various factors, which include the characteristics of the electrode slurry and attributes (particle size, surface coatings) of the silicon powders. A catalytic effect on gas evolution is observed when a lithiated polycarboxylate binder is present in the solution. On the other hand, negligible gas generation is observed in electrode slurries containing the N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent, which could be considered as an alternative to the water-based processes presently under consideration. Our study can be used as a guide for the development of slurry mixtures that can mitigate the safety concerns associated with the silicon-electrode fabrication process.

Mixed-valence dimolybdenum complexes containing hard oxo and soft carbonyl ligands: synthesis, structure, and electrochemistry of Mo-2(O)(CO)(2)(mu-kappa(2)-S(CH2)(n)S)(2)(kappa(2)-diphosphine)	DALTON TRANSACTIONS			English	Article							SET MODEL CHEMISTRY; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; MOLYBDENUM COMPLEXES; POLYTHIOETHER COMPLEXES; MOLECULAR-STRUCTURES; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; OLEFIN EPOXIDATION; TOTAL ENERGIES; REACTIVITY; ATOMS	Mixed-valence dimolybdenum complexes Mo-2(O)(CO)(2){mu-kappa(2)-S(CH2)nS}(2)(kappa(2)-Ph2P(CH2)(m)PPh2) (n = 2, 3; m = 1, 2) (1-4) have been synthesized from one-pot reactions of fac-Mo(CO)(3)(NCMe)(3) and dithiols, HS (CH2)(n)SH, in the presence of diphosphines. The dimolybdenum framework is supported by two thiolate bridges, with one molybdenum carrying a terminal oxo ligand and the second two carbonyls. The dppm (m = 1) products exist as a pair of diastereomers differing in the relative orientation of the two carbonyls (cis and trans) at the Mo(CO)(2)(dppm)center, while dppe (m = 2) complexes are found solely as the trans isomers. Small amounts of Mo(CO){kappa(3)-S(CH2CH2S)(2)}(kappa(2)-dppe) (5) also result from the reaction using HS (CH2)(2)SH and dppe. The bonding in isomers of 1-4 has been computationally explored by DFT calculations, trans diastereomers being computed to be more stable than the corresponding pair of cis diastereomers for all. The calculations confirm the existence of Mo O and Mo-Mo bond orders and suggest that the new dimeric compounds are best viewed as Mo(V)-Mo(I) mixed-valence systems. The electrochemical properties of 1 have been investigated by CV and show a reversible one-electron reduction associated with the Mo(V) centre, while two closely spaced irreversible oxidation waves are tentatively assigned to oxidation of the Mo(I) centre of the two isomers as supported by DFT calculations.

Ceric homoleptic complex Ce[OSi(OtBu)(3)](4) was obtained by the reaction of[Et4N](2)[CeCl6] with NaOSi(OtBu)(3) at ambient temperature in acetonitrile, while cerous ion-separated complex [Ce{OSi(OtBu)(3)}(4)][K(2.2.2-crypt)] was readily synthesized from [Ce{OSi(OtBu)(3)}(4)K] and cryptand. The solid-state structures of monocerium complexes Ce[OSi(OtBu) 3] 4 and Ce[OSi(OtBu)(3)](4)(THF) show 5- and 6-coordinate Ce-IV centers (one kappa(2)-bonded siloxy ligand), while complex [Ce{OSi(OtBu)(3)}(4)][K(2.2.2-crypt)] exhibits a 4-coordinate Ce-III center (all-terminal siloxy coordination). A comparative electrochemical study of Ce[OSi(OtBu)(3)](4) and [Ce{OSi(OtBu)(3)}(4)][K(2.2.2-crypt)] suggests a redox-modulated molecular rearrangement process, featuring oxidation-state dependent formation and release of a Ce center dot center dot center dot OtBu coordination. While the overall stabilization of Ce-IV by the siloxy ligand is evident, significant extra stabilization is gained if the siloxy ligand coordinates in a chelating fashion, which is further supported by DFT calculations. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis indicates an enhanced donation of the siloxy ligand electron density into the unfilled Ce-IV 6s, 4f, and 5d orbitals. Ce-IV to Ce-III reduction readily occurs when homoleptic complex Ce[OSi(OtBu)(3)](4) is treated with cobaltocene, affording the separated ion pair [Ce{OSi(OtBu)(3)}(4)][CoCp2], featuring exclusive terminal siloxy bonding in the solid-state, similar to that detected for [Ce{OSi(OtBu)(3)}(4)][K(2.2.2-crypt)].

Electrochemomechanical Fatigue: Decoupling Mechanisms of Fracture- Induced Performance Degradation in LiXMn2O4	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES; OXIDE FUEL-CELLS; CAPACITY FADE; ELECTROCHEMICAL SHOCK; MANGANESE-DIOXIDE; SPINEL ELECTRODES; INTERCALATION ELECTRODES; STRUCTURAL FATIGUE; IMPEDANCE SPECTRA; ACOUSTIC-EMISSION	Decades of Li-ion battery (LIB) research have identified mechanical and chemical culprits that limit operational lifetime of LIB electrodes. For example, severe capacity fade of unmodified LiXMn2O4 electrodes has been linked historically with Mn dissolution and, more recently, fracture of the electrochemically active particles. Mitigation approaches targeting both effects have prolonged cycle and calendar life, but the fundamental mechanistic sequences linking fracture to capacity fade in LiXMn2O4 and many other cathode materials remain ambiguous. Here, we investigate specifically the temporal correlations of fracture, capacity fade, and impedance growth to gain understanding of the interplay between these phenomena and the time scales over which they occur. By conducting controlled excursions into the cubic-tetragonal phase transformation regime of LiXMn2O4, we find that fracture contributes to impedance growth and capacity fade by two distinct mechanisms occurring over different time scales: (1) poorly conducting crack surfaces immediately hinder electronic conduction through the bulk of the electrode, and (2) capacity fades at a faster rate over multiple cycles, due plausibly to dissolution reactions occurring at newly formed electrode-electrolyte interfaces. The deconvolution of these effects in a well-studied cathode material such as LiXMn2O4 facilitates understanding of the complex relationship between mechanics and electrochemistry in LIB electrodes.

Electrochlorination has proved to be one of the most reliable applications of electrochemistry in water treatment with improved performance in comparison to conventional chlorination. Several research efforts have been devoted to the development of these technologies; however these studies barely considered the release of chlorine volatile species (Cl-2, ClO2 and Cl2O). Here, a semi-quantitative analysis of various volatile species produced during the electrolysis of highly saline water (0.6M NaCl) at BDD electrode has been conducted by differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) using the dual thin layer flow through cell. The effect of solution pH and electrolyte flow rates on the release of volatile species has been considered. Electrolysis of 0.6M NaClO4 evidenced the competition between O-2 and Cl-2 evolution towards the electrogenerated center dot OH radicals during electrolysis in presence of chloride. Evolution of Cl-2 was favored at acidic pH, whereas its evolution is inhibited at alkaline pH. The quantification of released species highlighted that the evolution of chlorine corresponds to a ca. 80% of the current efficiency, which is a significant contribution to the overall electrochlorination process.

In lithium ion batteries, LiC6 forms from graphite and desolvated Li cations during the first charge. With sodium ions, graphite only shows a significant capacity when Na+ intercalates as a solvated complex, resulting in ternary graphite intercalation compounds (GICs). Although this chemistry has been shown to be highly reversible and to support high rates in small test cells, these GICs can require >250% volume expansion and contraction during cycling. Here we demonstrate the first example of GICs that reversibly sodiate/desodiate without any significant volume change. These pillared GICs are obtained by electrochemical reduction of graphite in an ether/amine co-solvent electrolyte. The initial gallery expansion, 0.36 nm, is less than half of that in diglyme-based systems, and shows a similar capacity. Thermal analyses suggest the pillaring phenomenon arises from stronger co-intercalate interactions in the GIC galleries.

However, it is not well-understood how the interchromophoric electronic coupling varies with the chromophore size in linearly connected molecular wires. Here, we show with the aid of electrochemistry, electronic spectroscopy, density functional theory calculations, and theoretical modeling that as the number of aromatic moieties in a single chromophore increases, the interchromophoric electronic coupling decreases and may reach negligible values if the chromophore is sufficiently large. The origin of this initially surprising result becomes clear when one considers this problem with the aid of Hiickel molecular orbital theory, as at the polymeric limit energies of the molecular orbitals cluster to form bands and thus the energy spacing between orbitals, and thereby the electronic coupling must decrease with the chromophore expansion.

The SA is determined by electrochemically measuring the number of coulombs of charge passed during the reduction of surface Au2O3 following Au NS oxidation in HClO4, whereas V is determined by electrochemically measuring the coulombs of charge passed during the complete oxidative dissolution of all of the Au in the Au NSs in the presence of Br- to form aqueous soluble AuBr4-. Assuming a spherical geometry and taking into account the total number of Au NSs on the electrode surface, the SA/V is theoretically equal to 3/radius. A plot of the electrochemically measured SA/V versus 1/radius for five different-sized Au NSs is linear with a slope of 1.8 instead of the expected value of 3. Following attachment of the Au NSs to the electrode and ozone treatment, the plot of SA/V versus 1/radius is linear with a slope of 3.5, and the size based on electrochemistry matches very closely with those measured by scanning electron microscopy. We believe the ozone cleans the Au NS surface, allowing a more accurate measurement of the SA.

Reaction order experiments were conducted at low temperature in an ethanol medium affording high solubility and surface-affinity for carbon monoxide. Surprisingly, the methane production rate is suppressed by increasing the pressure of CO, whereas ethylene production remains largely unaffected. The data show that CH4 and H-2 production are linked through a common H intermediate and that methane is formed through reactions among adsorbed H and CO, which are in direct competition with each other for surface sites. The data exclude the participation of solution species in rate-limiting steps, highlighting the importance of increasing surface recombination rates for efficient fuel synthesis.

Half Reactions with Multiple Redox States Do Not Follow the Standard Theory: A Computational Study of Electrochemistry of C-60	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							ELECTRON-TRANSFER REACTIONS; MARCUS-HUSH THEORY; POLAR-SOLVENTS; REORGANIZATION ENERGY; DIPOLE SOLVATION; DYNAMICS; POLARIZABILITY; MOLECULES; CHEMISTRY; MODEL	The standard theory of electron transfer advanced by Marcus predicts that the solvent reorganization energy of electron transfer does not depend on the redox state of the reactant. For instance, it should be the same in the reduced and oxidized states of a half reaction. This theory prediction is verifiable by measuring activation barriers of electron transfer reactions involving multiple oxidation states. We use here the opportunity offered by electrochemistry of C-60, which allows charges from 0 to -4 in a sequence of reduction half reactions. We find that the activation barrier does change with altering redox state of a fullerene, which can be experimentally verified by measuring Arrhenius slopes of corresponding reaction rates. This outcome is connected to the alteration of the molecular polarizability caused by electronic transitions. Classical molecular dynamics simulations of a fullerene in water are combined here with the analytical Q-model of electron transfer involving polarizable molecules. The main outcome of the study is that altering molecular polarizability makes the reorganization energy and the reaction activation barrier depend on the redox state of the reactant.

Unfortunately, the growth of Li dendrites during cycling leads to an unstable interface, a low coulombic efficiency, and a limited cycling life. Here, a novel approach is proposed to protect the Li-metal anode by using a uniform agarose film. This natural biopolymer film exhibits a high ionic conductivity, high elasticity, and chemical stability. These properties enable a fast Li-ion transfer and feasiblity to accomodate the volume change of Li metal, resulting in a dendrite-free anode and a stable interface. Morphology characterization shows that Li ions migrate through the agarose film and then deposit underneath it. A full cell with the cathode of LiFPO4 and an anode contaning the agarose film exhibits a capacity retention of 87.1% after 500 cycles, much better than that with Li foil anode (70.9%) and Li-deposited Cu anode (5%). This study provides a promising strategy to eliminate dendrites and enhance the cycling ability of lithium-metal batteries through coating a robust artificial film of natural biopolymer on lithium-metal anode.

Revealing the Effects of Electrode Crystallographic Orientation on Battery Electrochemistry via the Anisotropic Lithiation and Sodiation of ReS2	ACS NANO			English	Article						reaction mechanism of lithium/sodium-ion battery; 2D transition metal dichalcogenides; anisotropic lithiation and sodiation; ReS2; in situ transmission electron microscopy	INITIO MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; AB-INITIO; MOS2 NANOSHEETS; TIO2 ANATASE; INTERCALATION; TRANSITION; SODIUM; OXIDE; SEMICONDUCTOR; ARCHITECTURE	The crystallographic orientation of battery electrode materials can significantly impact electrochemical performance, such as rate capability and cycling stability. Among the layered transition metal dichalcogenides, rhenium disulfide (ReS2) has the largest anisotropic ratio between the two main axes in addition to exceptionally weak interlayer coupling, which serves as an ideal system to observe and analyze anisotropy of electrochemical phenomena. Here, we report anisotropic lithiation and sodiation of exfoliated ReS2 at atomic resolution using in situ transmission electron microscopy. These results reveal the role of crystallographic orientation and anisotropy on battery electrode electrochemistry. Complemented with density functional theory calculations, the lithiation of ReS2 is found to begin with intercalation of Li-ions, followed by a conversion reaction that results in Re nanoparticles and Li2S nanocrystals. The reaction speed is highly anisotropic, occurring faster along the in-plane ReS2 layer than along the out-of-plane direction. Sodiation of ReS2 is found to proceed similarly to lithiation, although the intercalation step is relatively quicker. Furthermore, the microstructure and morphology of the reaction products after lithiation/sodiation show clear anisotropy along the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. These results suggest that crystallographic orientation in highly anisotropic electrode materials can be exploited as a design parameter to improve battery electrochemical performance.

While both the electrochemistry and interlayer engineering of the materials have been reported, the role of interlayer engineering in improving the Li-ion storage of these materials remains unclear. Here, we rationally introduce pillar ions with conjugated anion dicarboxylate groups, cobalt oxalate ions ([CoOx(2)](2-)), into the interlayers of Co(OH)(2) nanosheets [denoted as I-Co(OH)(2) NSs]. The pillar ion guarantees excellent structural stability, high electrical conductivity, and accelerated Li-ion diffusion. The structure delivers high-rate cycling performance for lithium-ion batteries. This work provides insights for the design of LH-based high-performance electrode materials by a rational interlayer-engineering strategy.

Improved Capacity Retention of Metal Oxide Anodes in Li-Ion Batteries: Increasing Intraparticle Electronic Conductivity through Na Inclusion in Mn3O4	CHEMELECTROCHEM			English	Article						Electrochemistry; lithium; sodium; doping; metal oxides	CARBON NANOTUBES; PERFORMANCE; MOF; COMPOSITES; NANOWIRES; GRAPHENE; STORAGE; MNO2	In this work, we significantly improve the cyclability of Mn3O4 anodes in Li-ion batteries by enhancing its intraparticle electronic conductivity by doping with Na. Na was selected because, unlike typical transition-metal dopants, it is non-surface redox active in the potential window where the metal oxide conversion reaction occurs, and hence is more electrochemically stable during charge/discharge cycling. This work presents the first time that Na has been used as a dopant in metal oxide anodes, and the result is excellent capacity retention and rate capability. More specifically, Na was added to Mn3O4 (to achieve a Mn/Na ratio of ca. 9: 1), impregnated onto a carbon nanotube matrix. The concentration of Na considering the entire composition of the anode material was 0.5 at%. These electrodes were able to achieve a capacity of approximately 750 mAh/g at a 1C rate, and retain over 99% of that capacity over 500 cycles. They were also able to provide nearly twice the theoretical capacity of conventional graphite anodes under high rate discharge (609 mAh/g @ 5C), as well as achieve a higher capacity at 10C (ca. 350 mAh/g) than conventional graphite electrodes can at 1C.

The localized corrosion behavior is affected by the micromechanics and the electrochemistry of the material; however, there are very limited studies where both mechanisms are studied jointly, let alone relative to microstructural attributes, i.e., at the mesoscale. High-resolution strain maps are created on pre-loaded AA7050 in the transverse-short orientation via digital image correlation to identify strain accumulation with respect to the microstructure. Afterward, this material is subjected to a galvanic corrosion environment In order to investigate the driving force for localized corrosion, the microstructure, the cathodic particles, the localized strain, and the evolution of surface topology caused by corrosion pitting are spatially characterized in the region of interest. The evolution of the corroded surface is tracked every 24 h throughout the 20 d of corrosion that the material was immersed in 0.6 M NaCl solution. Specifically, three representative sized cathodic particles are monitored throughout the corrosion study, to identify their evolution of pitting before and after the particles fallout from contact with the matrix. Finally, the relationship between strain and localized galvanic corrosion is quantitatively investigated using Gaussian process modeling to identify the underlying correlations. The results show that localized strains within +/- 3a of the macroscopic residual strain do not affect the corrosion rate of the material; however, extreme values beyond that threshold associated with the cracking of the particle itself seem to heavily promote the growth of localized galvanic corrosion.

Electrolytic control of hydrogen peroxide release from calcium peroxide in aqueous solution	ELECTROCHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Calcium peroxide; Electrochemistry; H2O2 releasing manipulation	WATER-TREATMENT; SOIL; TRICHLOROETHYLENE; OXIDATION; OXYGEN; REDOX; PH; REMEDIATION; DEGRADATION; COMPOUND	The in situ generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for water treatment is more practical than the use of liquid H2O2, which is costly to store and transport. Calcium peroxide (CaO2), a solid carrier of H2O2, can release H2O2 on dissolution in water. However, the constant H2O2 release rate of CaO2 has been a bottleneck constraining its wider application. In this study, a practical electrochemical method using a divided cell is developed to control the rate of release of H2O2 from CaO2. The results show that the rate of H2O2 release from CaO2 is enhanced in the anolyte. The increase in H2O2 release is positively correlated with the current. Under a current of 100 mA, the H2O2 concentration was 2.5 times higher after 30 min of electrolysis than in the control experiment in which no current was applied. Water electrolysis in the anodic compartment generates protons that not only: (i) enhance dissolution of CaO2 and release of H2O2, but also (ii) neutralize the alkaline pH resulting from CaO2 dissolution, thus providing new advantages for the use of CaO2.

In operando neutron powder diffraction is used investigate the structure-electrochemistry relationship of the electrode materials in a Valence Technology Inc. 18650 Energy cell (IFR18650EC) containing a graphite negative electrode and a Mg-doped LiFePO4 (Li(MgFe)PO4) positive electrode. Two cells were studied at ambient (298 K) and elevated (323 K) temperature, and higher temperatures were found to improve reaction kinetics and hence capacity. Rietveld refinement of structural models against the diffraction data revealed information about the nucleation of the lithiated and delithiated phases in the Li(MgFe) PO4 positive electrode material as a function of each cell's state of charge. Polarisation was indicated by a shift in the potential at which the lithiated and delithiated (MgFe)PO4 phases nucleate during cycling, the extent of which was found to be linearly proportional to the applied current. This work provides new evidence for polarisation of the positive electrode material in a Li-ion battery system.

Herein, we describe the preparation of a novel 3D nanostructured MnO2-based composite developed using a carbonized proteinaceous spongin template by an extreme biomimetics approach. The thermal stability of the spongin-based scaffold facilitated the formation of both carbonized material (at 650 degrees C with exclusion of oxygen) and manganese oxide with a defined nanoscale structure under 150 degrees C. Remarkably, the unique network of spongin fibers was maintained after pyrolysis and hydrothermal processing, yielding a novel porous support. The MnO2-spongin composite shows a bimodal pore distribution, with macropores originating from the spongin network and mesopores from the nanostructured oxidic coating. Interestingly, the composites also showed improved electrochemical properties compared to those of MnO2. Voltammetry cycling demonstrated the good stability of the material over more than 3,000 charging/discharging cycles. Additionally, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed lower charge transfer resistance in the prepared materials. We demonstrate the potential of extreme biomimetics for developing a new generation of nanostructured materials with 3D centimeter-scale architecture for the storage and conversion of energy generated from renewable natural sources.

The direct reduction of carbonic acid on a steel surface is believed to be the cause of the higher corrosion rates of mild steel, as compared to that observed in strong-acid solutions with the same pH. However, in-depth quantitative analyses based on comprehensive mechanistic models, developed in recent years, have challenged this idea. In an attempt to provide explicit experimental evidence for the significance of direct reduction of carbonic acid in CO2 corrosion of mild steel, the charge transfer controlled cathodic currents in CO2 saturated solutions were investigated in the present study. The experiments were conducted on three different surfaces: Type 316L stainless steel, pure iron, and API 5L X65 mild steel, in order to examine the possible effect of alloying impurities on the kinetics and the mechanism of cathodic currents. The experimental polarization curves showed that at a constant pH, the charge transfer controlled cathodic currents did not increase with increasing partial pressure of CO2 from 0 bar to 5 bar. This confirmed that the direct carbonic acid reduction was not significant at the conditions covered in the present study, and its sole effect was to buffer the hydrogen ion concentration.

In one of the complexes, both the coordinated phenoxy groups retain their protons and thus this is the cationic equivalent species of the other complex where both coordinated phenoxy groups are deprotonated. In addition, perchlorate anions are present for charge balance, as well as methanol solvate molecules. For the neutral NiL2 complex, each 2-ethylaminepyridine arm is disordered over two equivalent conformations with occupancies of 0.750 (8):0.250 (8). The perchlorate anion is disordered over two equivalent conformations with occupancies of 0.602 (8):0.398 (8). The perchlorate ions also link to the H atoms on the methanol methyl and hydroxyl groups. These interactions link the moieties into a complex three-dimensional array.

However, the commercialization of Li-S batteries is being hindered by several serious technical challenges including the corrosion of lithium metal anodes, the formation of lithium dendrites, the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides, the decomposition of electrolyte, and low conductivity of sulfur and lithium sulfide. In the past decade, atomic layer deposition (ALD) as a new research thrust has been demonstrated to be a very effective technique in dramatically improving the performance of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), featuring many unique advantages in fabricating sub-nano to nanoscale inorganic films. Stimulated by ALD's benefits, recently more and more research efforts have been reported in ALD for addressing the technical issues of Li-S batteries and show very promising outcomes. Analogous to ALD, molecular layer deposition (MLD) is a thin-film technique exclusively for polymeric films. Some of the latest studies have uncovered that MLD is an alternative tool for tackling the challenges of Li-S batteries with exceptional effectiveness. In this review, for the first time, we systematically summarized the progresses of both ALD and MLD in developing superior Li-S batteries, covering their technical strategies, resulting performance, and the underlying mechanisms. In terms of the functionalities of ALD and MLD in Li-S batteries, we focus our discussion in two main complementary aspects: (i) surface coatings and (ii) electrode designs.

Homozygous MUTYH mutations underlie the autosomal, recessive cancer syndrome MUTYH-associated polyposis. We report a MUTYH variant, p.C306W (c.918C>G), with a tryptophan residue in place of native cysteine, that ligates the [4fe4S] cluster in a patient with colonic polyposis and family history of early age colon cancer. In bacterial MutY, the [4fe4S] cluster is redox active, allowing rapid localization to target lesions by long-range, DNA-mediated signalling. In the current study, using DNA electrochemistry, we determine that wild-type MUTYH is similarly redox-active, but MUTYH C306W undergoes rapid oxidative degradation of its cluster to [3Fe4S](+), with loss of redox signalling. In MUTYH C306W, oxidative cluster degradation leads to decreased DNA binding and enzyme function. This study confirms redox activity in eukaryotic DNA repair proteins and establishes MUTYH C306W as a pathogenic variant, highlighting the essential role of redox signalling by the [4fe4S] cluster.

J	Nerimetla, R; Premaratne, G; Liu, HY; Krishnan, S				Nerimetla, Rajasekhara; Premaratne, Gayan; Liu, Hongyun; Krishnan, Sadagopan			Improved electrocatalytic metabolite production and drug biosensing by human liver microsomes immobilized on amine-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Electrocatalysis; Human liver microsomes; Magnetic nanoparticles; Drug metabolites; Drug biosensing	ELECTRON-TRANSFER; DIRECT ELECTROCHEMISTRY; HUMAN CYTOCHROME-P450; SENSITIVITY ENHANCEMENT; FE3O4 NANOPARTICLES; CARBON NANOTUBES; POLYION FILMS; MYOGLOBIN; ENZYMES; VOLTAMMETRY	A biocatalytic system constructed by electrostatically immobilizing drug metabolizing human liver microsomes (HLM, negatively charged due to phospholipids) onto positively charged amine-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (MNPamine, 100 nm hydrodynamic diameter) for biosensing of cytochrome P450 (CYP)-specific drug candidates and electrocatalyzing drug conversion into metabolites is reported. The MNP-adsorbed HLM biomaterial (denoted as MNPamine/HLM) was magnetically separated from the bulk suspension of HLM, washed twice in phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and adsorbed onto polished edge-plane pyrolytic graphite (EPG) electrodes. Direct electrochemical properties and oxygen reduction currents were obtained by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Direct electron transfer kinetics from the microsomal redox proteins present in the adsorbed film of MNPamine/HLM on EPG surface was accomplished using square wave voltammetry due to its smaller background charging currents and improved faradaic peak intensity than CV. The MNPamine/HLM bioelectrodes exhibited a formal potential of -0.46 V vs Ag/AgCl reference (1M KCl), which was in agreement with the FAD/FMN cofactor containing CYP-reductase (CPR) as the electron receiver from the electrode. This conclusion was drawn based on the formal potentials of only CPR (similar to-0.47 V vs Ag/AgCl) containing bactosomal films adsorbed on EPG electrodes (bactosomes are bacterial membrane expressed enzymes). Whereas, bactosomal CYP 2C9 film showed a much more positive formal potential (-0.34 V vs Ag/AgCl). A heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant of 19 +/- 5 s(-1) was exhibited by the MNPamine/HLM film. Oxygen reduction currents and electrocatalytic diclofenac hydroxylation characteristics of the CYP enzymes present in the HLM film indicated the electron mediation by the CYP-reductase from the electrode to CYP-heme centers to initiate the catalytic cycle. Amperometric i-t curves with diclofenac drug concentration yielded the apparent Michaelis-Menten affinity constants (K-M(app)) of MNPamine/HLM and only HLM films as 302 +/- 33 and 365 +/- 36 mu M, respectively. This is the first electrocatalysis report of bioelectrodes featuring HLM-bound MNPamine for applications in drug activity assays, enhanced metabolite production, and sensitive biosensing of CYPspecific drugs and environmental pollutants. Eliminations of tedious isolation and purification of membrane-containing CYPs, and the need for expensive NADPH cofactor (as electrode donates the reducing equivalents in an inexpensive and sustainable manner) are added advantages. Our future work aims to gain quantitative metabolite estimations upon scalability of such bioelectrode designs useful for pharmacological and toxicological evaluations of new drugs in development.

The purpose of this work is to assess the applicability of DPV to monitor the photochemical behaviour of xenobiotics, along with the development of an electrochemical set-up for the real-time monitoring of APAP photodegradation. We here investigated the APAP photoreactivity towards the main photogenerated reactive transients species occurring in sunlit surface waters (hydroxyl radical HO center dot, carbonate radical CO3(center dot) (-), excited triplet state of anthraquinone-2-sulfonate used as proxy of the chromophoric DOM, and singlet oxygen O-1(2)), and determined relevant kinetic parameters. A standard procedure based on UV detection coupled with liquid chromatography (HPLC-UV) was used under identical experimental conditions to compare and verify the DPV-based results. The latter were in agreement with HPLC data, with the exception of the triplet-sensitized processes. In the other cases, DPV could be used as an alternative to the well-tested but more costly and time-consuming HPLC-UV technique. We have also assessed the reaction rate constant between APAP and HO center dot by real-time DPV, which allowed for the monitoring of APAP photodegradation inside the irradiation chamber. Unfortunately, real-time DPV measurements are likely to be affected by temperature variations of the irradiated samples. Overall, DPV appeared as a fast, cheap and reasonably reliable technique when used for the off-line monitoring of APAP photodegradation. When a suitable real-time procedure is developed, it could become a very straightforward method to study the photochemical behaviour of electroactive xenobiotics. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We sought to develop a cervical spinal cord stimulator for the rat that is durable, stable, and does not perturb the underlying spinal cord. Approach. We created a softening spinal cord stimulation (SCS) array made from shape memory polymer (SMP)-based flexible electronics. We developed a new photolithographic process to pattern high surface area titanium nitride (TiN) electrodes onto gold (Au) interconnects. The thiol-ene acrylate polymers are stiff at room temperature and soften following implantation into the body. Durability was measured by the duration the devices produced effective stimulation and by accelerated aging in vitro. Stability was measured by the threshold to provoke an electromyogram (EMG) muscle response and by measuring impedance using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). In addition, spinal cord modulation of motor cortex potentials was measured. The spinal column and implanted arrays were imaged with MRI ex vivo, and histology for astrogliosis and immune reaction was performed. Main results. For durability, the design of the arrays was modified over three generations to create an array that demonstrated activity up to 29 weeks. SCS arrays showed no significant degradation over a simulated 29 week period of accelerated aging. For stability, the threshold for provoking an EMG rose in the first few weeks and then remained stable out to 16 weeks; the impedance showed a similar rise early with stability thereafter. Spinal cord stimulation strongly enhanced motor cortex potentials throughout. Upon explantation, device performance returned to pre-implant levels, indicating that biotic rather than abiotic processes were the cause of changing metrics. MRI and histology showed that softening SCS produced less tissue deformation than Parylene-C arrays. There was no significant astrogliosis or immune reaction to either type of array. Significance. Softening SCS arrays meet the needs for research-grade devices in rats and could be developed into human devices in the future.

The outermost layer is mostly NiFe2O4, the middle layer mainly consists of NiO, and the innermost is a Curich metal layer. The dense NiFe2O4 layer is resistant to molten salts and prevents O2- diffusing inwards, the middle NiO layer conducts electrons and functions as a buffer layer to increase the mechanical robustness of the whole scale, and the third copper-rich layer could help to slow down the oxidation rate of the alloy.

Catalytic Interconversion of the Quinone/Hydroquinone Couple by a Surface-Bound Os(III/II) Polypyridyl Couple	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							ELECTRON-TRANSFER; PROTON-TRANSFER; WATER OXIDATION; HYDROQUINONE; COMPLEXES; QUINONES; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; BENZOQUINONE; MECHANISM; SYSTEM	Surface catalytic interconversion of hydroquinone (H(2)Q) and 1,4-benzoquinone (Q) occur at a fluorine-doped tin oxide electrode (FTO) modified by the addition of the surface-bound couple, [Os(bpy)(2)((4,4'PO3H2)(2)bpy)](3+/2+) (OsP2+, bpy = bipyridine and 4,4'(PO3H2)(2) = 4,4'-phosphonato-2,2'-bipyridine). Significant rate enhancements are observed with the added solution buffers-phosphate, acetate, and citrate- and a surface-bound, pyridine base. Analysis of cyclic voltammograms for the 2e(-)/ 2H(+) couple, by use of the Butler-Volmer equation, point to the importance of acid-base effects and H-bonding in enhancing the reaction rate at the electrode.

The rich chemistry and strong sigma-donating ability of NHCs offer unique prospects for applications in nanoelectronics, sensing, and electrochemistry. Although stable in SAMs, free carbenes are notoriously reactive, making their electronic characterization challenging. Here we report the first investigation of electron transport across single NHC-bound molecules using the scanning tunneling microscope-based break junction (STM-BJ) technique. We develop a series of air-stable metal NHC complexes that can be electrochemically reduced in situ to form NHC electrode contacts, enabling reliable single molecule conductance measurements of NHCs under ambient conditions. Using this approach, we show that the conductance of an NHC depends on the identity of the single metal atom to which it is coordinated in the junction. Our observations are supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which also firmly establish the contributions of the NHC linker to the junction transport characteristics. Our work demonstrates a powerful method to probe electron transfer across NHC electrode interfaces; more generally, it opens the door to the exploitation of surface-bound NHCs in constructing novel, functionalized electrodes and/or nanoelectronic devices.

The electrical performance of aerosol-jet printed (AJP) graphene was characterized using the Transmission Line Method (TLM). The electrical resistance decreased with increasing printing pass number (n); the lowest sheet resistance measured was 1.5 k Omega/sq. for n = 50. The role of thermal resistance (R-TH) in power dissipation was studied using a combination of electrical breakdown thermometry and infrared (IR) imaging. A simple lumped thermal model (T = P x R-TH) and COMSOL Multiphysics was used to extract the total R-TH, including interfaces. The R-TH of AJP graphene on Kapton is similar to 27 times greater than that of AJP graphene on Al2O3 with a corresponding breakdown current density 10 times less on Kapton versus Al2O3.

Continuous flow chemistry brings pharmaceutical industry numerous advantages, but implementing electroorganic synthesis in flow is challenging, especially for electroorganic reactions with coupled electrode reactions and slow chemical reactions. We present a continuous electrolysis system engineered for N-hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) mediated electrochemical aerobic oxidation of benzylic C-H bonds. First, a cation-exchange membrane prevents the crossover of the NHPI anion from anolyte to catholyte avoiding reductive decomposition of NHPI at the cathode, and enables the usage of a cost-effective reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) cathode instead of a platinum electrode. Second, running the electrochemical flow cell with recycle streams accommodates the inherently slow kinetics of the chemical reaction without phthalimide-N-oxyl (PINO) radical self-decomposition at the anode, and allows the usage of gaseous oxygen as co-oxidant.

The electrode materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results revealed that 1-2 nm carbon films were successfully coated on the LiFePO4 particles. The electrochemical properties of LiFePO4/C composite were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), and electrochemical analysis. The test results showed that the LiFePO4/C composite possessed outstanding reversibility, cycle performance, and rate performance. The discharge capacities of LiFePO4/C were 161.5 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and 143.6 mAh g(-1) at 1 C, respectively. The excellent electrochemical properties of the LiFePO4/C electrode were mainly due to the thin, uniform, and highly graphitized carbon films.

With 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino) benzene (dppb) a second product is the cubane cluster [Fe-4(CO)(10)(mu(3)-Te)(4) (kappa(2)-dppb)] (8). Cyclic voltammetry measurements on 2-7 reveal that all clusters show irreversible reductive behaviour at ca. 1.85 V with a series of associated small back oxidation waves, suggesting that reduction leads to significant structural change but that this can be reversed chemically. Oxidation occurs at relatively low potentials and is diphosphine-dependent. The first oxidation appears at ca. +0.35 V for 2-6 with a small degree of reversibility but is as low as +0.14 V for the bis(diphenylphosphino)naphthalene derivative 7 and in some cases is followed by further closely -spaced oxidation. Addition of [Cp2Fe] [PE6] to 2-7 results in the formation of new clusters formulated as [Fe-3(CO)(8)(mu(3)-Te)(2)(kappa(2)-diphosphine)1, with their IR spectra suggesting oxidation at the diiron centre. This is supported by computational studies (DFT) of the bis(diphenylphosphino)propane cluster 5 showing that the HOMO is the Fe-Fe sigma-bonding orbital, while the LUMO is centered on the diphosphine-substituted iron atom and has significant Fe Te sigma*-anti-bonding character consistent with the irreversible nature of the reduction. Complexes 2-7 have been examined as proton reduction catalysts in the presence of para-toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH). All are active at their first reduction potential, with a second catalytic process being observed at slightly higher potentials. While their overall electrocatalytic behaviour is similar to that noted for [Fe-2(CO)(6){mu-E(CH2)(3)E}] (E = S, Se, Te), the DFT results suggest that as the added electron is localised on the unique iron atom. The mechanistic aspects of hydrogen formation are likely to be quite different from the more widely studied diiron models. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, for its long-term in vivo applications, the biocompatibility of PEDOT still needs to be improved. To address this challenge, zwitterionic poly(sulfobetaine 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PSBEDOT) that contains EDOT backbone with sulfobetaine functional side chains was developed in our previous study. Although PSBEDOT showed great resistance to proteins, cells, and bacteria, it is still not clear how the zwitterionic sulfobetaine side chain affects the electrochemical properties of the polymer and reactivity of the monomer. To achieve better understanding of the structure-function relationships of zwitterionic conducting polymers, we synthesized two derivatives of PSBEDOT, PSBEDOT-4 and PSBEDOT-5, by introducing the alkoxyl spacer between PEDOT backbone and sulfobetaine side chain. The interfacial impedance of PSBEDOT-4 and PSBEDOT-5 was examined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and showed significant improvement which is about 20 times lower than PSBEDOT on both gold and indium tin oxide substrates at 1 Hz. In the protein adsorption study, PSBEDOT, PSBEDOT-4 and PSBEDOT-5 exhibited comparable resistance to the fibrinogen solution. All three polymers had low protein adsorption around 3-5% comparing to PEDOT. Additionally, the morphology of PSBEDOT, PSBEDOT-4 and PSBEDOT-5 have been investigated by scanning electron microscopy. We believe that these stable and biocompatible materials can be excellent candidates for developing long-term bioelectronic devices. Statement of Significance To address the challenges associated with existing conducting polymers for bioelectronics, we developed a versatile and high performance zwitterionic conducting material platform with excellent stability, electrochemical, antifouling and controllable antimicrobial/antifouling properties. In this work, we developed two high-performance conducting polymers and systematically investigated how the structure affects their properties. Our study shows we can accurately tune the molecular structure of the monomer to improve the performance of zwitterionic conducting polymer. This zwitterionic conducting polymer platform may dramatically increase the performance and service life of bio-electrochemical devices for many long-term applications, such as implantable biosensing, tissue engineering, wound healing, robotic prostheses, biofuel cell etc., which all require high performance conducting materials with excellent antifouling property/biocompatibility at complex biointerfaces.

An integrated mass spectrometry platform enables picomole-scale real-time electrosynthetic reaction screening and discovery	CHEMICAL SCIENCE			English	Article							ELECTROSPRAY-IONIZATION; OXIDATION; COMPLEX; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; ELECTROOXIDATION; DEHYDROGENATION; AMINES; ONLINE; RATES; FLOW	The identification of new electrosynthetic pathways enables environmentally friendly synthetic applications. However, the development of miniaturized screening procedures/platforms to expedite the discovery of electrooxidation reactions remains challenging. Herein, we developed an integrated system that serves as a reactor and ion source in a single experimental step using only picomole-scale reactants to monitor electrooxidation in real-time. This reaction screening platform utilizes the intrinsic electrochemical capabilities of nano-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. We validated the feasibility of this method by reproducing three known electrochemical reactions. We also discovered two new electroorganic reaction pathways: (i) C-N dehydrodimerization of 8-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline to construct a novel quinoline skeleton, and (ii) TEMPO-mediated accelerated electrooxidative dehydrogenation of tetrahydroisoquinolines. Moreover, the radical cations and key intermediates captured by this screening platform provided direct evidence for the mechanism of these novel electrochemical reactions.

Optical electrochemical measurements at the single-particle level are necessary for understanding and eventually controlling the role of plasmons in such complex environments. Recently, researchers have developed techniques to optically measure electrochemical reactions at the surface of single nanoparticles and individual aggregates, allowing for the high-throughput screening necessary to resolve subpopulations of active nanoparticle catalysts and identify active sites on aggregate structures. This review highlights single-nanoparticle and nanoparticle aggregate electrochemical techniques and how they can be used to isolate and elucidate the role of surface plasmons in enhancing catalyst activity and sensing electrochemical processes at the nanoscale.

Unfortunately, these electrodes usually suffer from a low sulfur utilization rate and limited cycle life due to the gap in scientific knowledge between the fundamental research and the application at relevant scales. In this work, effects of electrode porosity on the electrode energy density, cell cycling stability, Li anode interface, and electrolyte/sulfur ratio were investigated on the basis of high-loading sulfur electrodes. Using electrodes with sulfur loading of 4 mg cm(-2) and thickness at similar to 60 mu m, a high energy density of over 1300 Wh L-1 has been obtained at electrode level, which provides a decent basis for high-energy Li-S cell development. In addition, Li-S cells with the high-loading and dense electrodes demonstrate promising cycling stability (similar to 80% capacity retention for 200 cycles). These significant improvements are contributed by the synergistic effects of dense sulfur cathode, improved electrode wetting, and suppressed quick growth of the interphase layer on Li-metal anode. This study sheds light on rational design of sulfur cathode for balanced cell energy density and cycling life.

Electrochemical detection of single bacteria was enabled by their inhibition of diffusive flux of a redox species when near the UME. With the UME biased for steady state oxidation of the redox species, each bacteria-electrode collision event at the UME resulted in a transient in the oxidation current. The two bacteria species show differences in their collision transient shapes, with E. coli showing "step" shaped transients and B. subtilis showing predominantly "blip" (spike) shaped transients. Simultaneous fluorescence microscopy of the UME surface during bacteria detection experiments allowed each current transient in the electrochemical data to be correlated with a specific collision event of fluorescently labeled bacteria. It was established that step-shaped transients observed for E. coli were due to adsorption of bacteria to the UME surface, while blip-shaped transients observed for B. subtilis were due to short-lived bounce events of the bacteria. The frequency of recorded transients varied linearly over bacteria concentrations of 1-10 fM for E. coli and 15-60 fM for B. subtilis, establishing the blocking collision method as a route for in situ determinations of bacteria concentration. This work demonstrates for the first time differences in blocking collision transient shapes between two bacterial analytes, and suggests applications of the method for selective electrochemical bacteria sensing.

However, the high solubility of organic materials in the liquid electrolyte results in the shuttle reaction and fast capacity decay. Herein, azo compounds are firstly applied in all-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLB) to suppress the dissolution challenge. Due to the high compatibility of azobenzene (AB) based compounds to Li3PS4 (LPS) solid electrolyte, the LPS solid electrolyte is used to prevent the dissolution and shuttle reaction of AB. To maintain the low interface resistance during the large volume change upon cycling, a carboxylate group is added into AB to provide 4-(phenylazo) benzoic acid lithium salt (PBALS), which could bond with LPS solid electrolyte via the ionic bonding between oxygen in PBALS and lithium ion in LPS. The ionic bonding between the active material and solid electrolyte stabilizes the contact interface and enables the stable cycle life of PBALS in ASSLB.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is a routine diagnostic method for the measurement of the equilibrium potential of a redox couple. When electrochemical processes are reversible, CV may be used to determine the number of electrons involved in the redox transition. However, on the timescale of the measurement, redox couples can appear distorted due to short lifetimes of ion radicals or coupled chemical processes. In these cases, the number of electrons involved in a redox process is unclear when following the most commonly available methods. With the advent of a renaissance in electrochemistry-based synthetic methods, we report a method based on combination of techniques: Normal Pulse Voltammetry (NPV) and a routine NMR experiment: Diffusion Ordered Spectroscopy (DOSY) to enable the determination of the number of electrons, n for a redox transition of such a couple. These two measurements provide an expeditious way to determine n using commonly available equipment.

Both desorption and oxidatively induced ligand substitution were observed on planar fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrodes, with a dependence on the E-1/2 Ru(III/II) redox potential dictating the comparative ratios of the processes. Complexes such as RuP4OMe (E-1/2 = 0.91 vs Ag/AgCl) displayed virtually only desorption, while complexes such as RuPbpz (E-1/(2) > 1.62 V vs Ag/AgCl) displayed only chemical decomposition. Comparing isomers of 4,4'- and 5,5'-disubstituted-2,2'-bipyridine ancillary ligands, a dramatic increase in the rate of desorption of the Ru(III) complexes was observed for the 5,5'-ligands. Nanoscopic indium-doped tin oxide thin films (nanolTO) were also sensitized and analyzed with cyclic voltammetry, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, and Xray photoelectron spectroscopy, allowing for further distinction of desorption versus ligand-substitution processes. Desorption loss to bulk solution associated with the planar surface of FTO is essentially non-existent on nanolTO, where both desorption and ligand substitution are shut down with RuP4OMe. These results revealed that minimizing time spent in the oxidized form, incorporating electron-donating groups, maximizing hydrophobicity, and minimizing molecular bulk near the adsorbed ligand are critical to optimizing the performance of ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes in dye-sensitized devices.

J	Schorr, NB; Jiang, AG; Rodriguez-Lopez, J				Schorr, Noah B.; Jiang, Annie G.; Rodriguez-Lopez, Joaquin			Probing Graphene Interfacial Reactivity via Simultaneous and Colocalized Raman-Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy Imaging and Interrogation	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							SOLID-ELECTROLYTE INTERPHASE; ORIENTED PYROLYTIC-GRAPHITE; SINGLE-LAYER GRAPHENE; LI+-INTERCALATION; ORDERED GRAPHITE; SEI FORMATION; X-RAY; SPECTROSCOPY; MONOLAYER; KINETICS	Addressing challenges in interfacial electrochemistry requires multimodal approaches that correlate the local structure and reactivity of materials with high spatial and temporal versatility. Here, we introduce spatiotemporally correlated Raman spectroscopy and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) to study the impact that structural heterogeneities, interfacial decomposition products, and layer number have on the electron-transfer properties of graphene electrodes. By colocalizing the SECM probe and laser line, we successfully obtained congruent SECM and Raman images at a rate of 5 s per pixel with sub-10 mu m resolution, obtaining full spectra per pixel at a signal-to-noise ratio as high as similar to 20. SECM imaging of a micropatterned graphene electrode showed its reactivity to be highly dependent on the intensity of the G peak, an indicator of the number of graphene layers. We further monitored the impact of excursions to positive potentials using the [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-) R redox pair as mediator. Raman-SECM allowed us to decouple the contributions to the redox response of different structural effects including exfoliation, increase in defect density, and surface film formation, on the same site and in real time. The coupling of in situ Raman spectroscopy and SECM provides a powerful surface-sensitive analytical approach to elucidate interfacial properties relevant to energy, catalysis, and sensing.

Role of Nanomorphology and Interfacial Structure of Platinum Nanoparticles in Catalyzing the Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction	ACS CATALYSIS			English	Article						catalysis; electrochemistry; hydrogen; platinum nanoparticles; surface chemistry	ELECTRON-TRANSFER; OXYGEN REDUCTION; EVOLUTION REACTION; DISK ELECTRODES; FUEL-CELLS; SURFACES; KINETICS; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; AGGREGATION; PERFORMANCE	This work studies the hydrogen oxidation reaction using both single mesoporous platinum nanoparticles (r(np) = 23.1 +/- 2.1 nm) and low density random arrays of material. The activity of the platinum catalyst, toward the oxidation of hydrogen, is shown to be potential dependent and exhibits two peaks in activity. These peaks in activity are measured at both random arrays of platinum nanoparticles and at the single entity scale. This alteration in the particle activity is directly reflected in the variation of the electrochemical current. These peaks in current do not relate to a mass-transport limitation of the reaction, and at high overpotentials the oxidation reaction becomes fully inhibited. This potential dependency is revealed at high current densities and arises due to the sensitivity of the reaction rate to the platinum interfacial structure; the decrease in activity [at ca. -0.2 V vs Ag/AgCl (1 M KCl) in a nonbuffered condition] directly correlates with the potential at which underpotential deposited hydrogen is removed from the catalytic interface. The contribution of the internal mesoporous nanoparticle structure toward the total particle catalytic activity is further evidenced through comparison of the time-current transients recorded for individual nanoparticles of differing morphology (solid vs mesoporous) and by evidencing the sensitivity of the single particle catalytic activity to the used supporting electrolyte concentration.

This is also because this cluster has been particularly stable under a number of experimental conditions. Very unexpectedly, we found that paramagnetic Au-25(SR)(18)(0) undergoes a spontaneous bimolecular fusion to form another benchmark gold nanocluster, Au-38(SR)(24). We tested this reaction with a series of Au-25 clusters. The fusion was confirmed and characterized by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, ESI mass spectrometry, H-1 and C-13 NMR spectroscopy, and electrochemistry. NMR evidences the presence of four types of ligand and, for the same proton type, double signals caused by the diastereotopicity arising from the chirality of the capping shell. This effect propagates up to the third carbon atom along the ligand chain. Electrochemistry provides a particularly convenient way to study the evolution process and determine the fusion rate constant, which decreases as the ligand length increases. No reaction is observed for the anionic clusters, whereas the radical nature of Au-25(SR)(18)(0) appears to play an important role. This transformation of a stable cluster into a larger stable cluster without addition of any co-reagent also features the bottom-up assembly of the Au-13 building block in solution. This very unexpected result could modify our view of the relative stability of molecular gold nanoclusters.

Formation mechanism of nickel coating and effects of the solution pH, loading capacity of ZTA particles and temperature on the nickel deposition were investigated. Microstructures, thickness and element distributions of nickel coating were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The results showed that the nickel was successfully deposited on the surface of ZTA particles by electroless plating without noticeable defects. The process of electroless nickel plating could be explained by combination of atomic hydrogen and electrochemistry theories. The interfacial nucleation of nickel is easier to form than spontaneous nucleation in the solution. Deposited Nickel has priority on the surface of ZTA particles comparing to that in solution. The optimal conditions to coat nickel on the surface of ZTA particles are: solution pH 4.7-4.8, loading capacity 15-20g/L, and electroless plating temperature 85 degrees C. The ZTA particle reinforced iron matrix composites prepared by powder metallurgy could have better interfacial bonding between ZTA particle and iron matrix because of the nickel coating on the surface of ZTA particle. Nickel diffuses into the iron matrix during the sintering preparation of composite materials. The interface between ZTA particle and iron matrix presents the evidence of non-chemical bonding.

Modifications of existing synthetic procedures were used to create QDs of different sizes and compositions (CdS passivated with polymer, and CdSe passivated with oleic acid/ trioctylphosphine). These were investigated by spectroscopy, to which standard 3D PIB mathematical models were applied to determine their effective size. The data were compared to those from other methods for students to see the validity of the PIB model. For CdSe QDs, an empirical formula was applied to the spectroscopic data. In the case of CdS, the synthesized QDs were studied with X-ray diffraction, from which one can also estimate the size of the QDs. Finally, the QDs were utilized as the light-harvesting layer in photovoltaic cells by attachment to a layer of surface-modified titania (TiO2) nanoparticles on conductive glass, and the surface chemistry tested via water contact-angle measurements. The photoresponse of these cells was measured using basic electrochemistry equipment for a selection of QDs, and these results were considered in relation to the light source used for excitation (CdS QDs absorb UV light, and a voltage was only measurable upon exposure to UV light). Students are able to synthesize, characterize, and apply their materials to a functional purpose. Ultimately, students drafted reports in the form of an ACS-style communication, allowing for a tie-in of typical lab reports to real-world journal publications.

The particles can be immobilized in an amino-substituted polysiloxane matrix to provide materials capable of dechlorinating, debrominating, and deiodinating a wide variety of halogenated organic molecules dissolved initially in a highly polar medium. The methodology involves diffusion of the organic molecules into the polysiloxane matrix, their reaction with the embedded iron nanoparticles, and then diffusion of the dehalogenated products back into the polar medium or into the air. Thus, the abilities of the coated particles, as suspensions or within an amino-substituted polysiloxane matrix crosslinked with succinic acid, to dehalogenate various organic molecules (especially the model compounds, bromobenzene and chlorobenzene). have been assessed. Data from several spectroscopic methods demonstrate that the particles arc in a crystalline alpha-Fe phase surrounded by the diacid shell. The effect of embedding 10 wt.% of the particles in amino-substituted polysiloxane-diacid matrices with different COOH/NH2 group ratios and the viscoelastic properties of the polymeric materials have been investigated as well.

When the main chain network is incorporated with functional groups that can undergo photo-chemical reaction upon light irradiation, the gel becomes light-responsive. Under irradiation, the photosensitive groups may undergo photo-ionization process and generate charges that are attached to the main chain or diffuse into the solvent. The newly generated ions disturb the osmotic balance of the gel medium. As a result, water molecules and mobile ions are driven into or out of the network to compensate the osmotic imbalance, which eventually leads to macroscopic swelling or shrinking of the gel. In this work, we develop a rigorous nonequilibrium thermodynamic framework to study the coupled photo-chemoelectro-mechanical responses of the photo-ionizable gels. We first discuss the mathematical descriptions of the light propagation and photo-induced chemical reactions inside the gel, as well as the equations governing the kinetics of the photo-chemical reactions. We then explore the consequences of the fundamental laws of thermodynamics in deriving the governing equations of the photo-ionizable gels. The continuous light irradiation drives the gel system towards a new thermodynamic stationary state that is away from equilibrium and is accompanied by energy dissipation. Next, we focus on the photo stationary state of the gel and explore the consequences of the continuous irradiation on the mechanical response of the gel in both optically thin and optically thick configurations. In the optically thin cases, we quantitatively compare the theoretical prediction with experimental data available in the literature. In one example, we show that the model can quantitatively capture the photo-tunable volume-phase transition of the Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) gel grafted with photo-responsive triphenylmethane leucocyanide groups. In another example, we show that the model can quantitatively study the effect of salt concentration and pH value of the external solution on the photo-induced swelling of the polyacrylamide gels incorporated with triphenylmethane leucohydroxide groups. Finally, for the optically thick gels, we develop a finite element code to study their inhomogeneous deformations due to the light attenuation. This work will be of great importance for precise control and optimal design of photo-ionizable gels in future applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Mahadevan, A; Fernando, S				Mahadevan, Aishwarya; Fernando, Sandun			Inorganic iron-sulfur clusters enhance electron transport when used for wiring the NAD-glucose dehydrogenase based redox system	MICROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Enzyme electrode; Molecular wire; Direct electron transfer; Wired enzyme; Enzyme monolayer; Glucose sensor; Bioelectronics; Electrode interface; Redox enzyme; Voltammetry	SELF-ASSEMBLED MONOLAYERS; AMPEROMETRIC BIOSENSORS; REDUCTIVE DESORPTION; GOLD NANOPARTICLE; CARBON NANOTUBES; OXIDASE; ENZYME; PROTEINS; AU(111); ELECTROCHEMISTRY	Wiring the active site of an enzyme directly to an electrode is the key to ensuring efficient electron transfer for the proper performance of enzyme-based bioelectronic systems. Iron-sulfur complexes, the first link between proteins and mediating molecules in the biological electron transport chain(s), possess an intrinsic electron transport capability. The authors demonstrate the application of inorganic iron-sulfur clusters (Fe-S) viz. FeS, FeS2, Fe2S3, and Fe3S4, as molecular wires to mediate electron transport between a glucose-selective redox enzyme and the gold electrode. It is shown that Fe-S can emulate the functionality of the natural electron transport chain. Voltammetric studies indicate a significant improvement in electron transport, surface coverage, and resilience achieved by the Fe-S-based glucose anodes when compared to a conventional pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-based electrode. The Fe-S-based glucose anodes showed glucose oxidation at a potential of +0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl with Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8) acting as a carrier. The current densities positively correlated with the concentrations of glucose in the range 0.1-100 mM displaying detection limits of 0.77 mM (FeS), 1.22 mM (FeS2), 2.95 mM (Fe2S3)(,) and 14.57 mM (Fe3S4). The metal-anchorable sulfur atom, the strong pi-coordinating iron atom, the favorable redox properties, low cost, and natural abundance make Fe-S an excellent electron-mediating relay capable of wiring redox active sites to electrode surfaces.

Despite the extensive investigation of its electrochemical properties, the fundamental dischargecharge reaction mechanism of the TiS2 electrode is still elusive. Here, by a combination of ex situ and operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy with density functional theory calculations, we have clearly elucidated the evolution of the structural and chemical properties of TiS2 during the dischargecharge processes. The lithium intercalation reaction is highly reversible and both Ti and sulfur are involved in the redox reaction during the discharge and charge processes. In contrast, the conversion reaction of TiS2 is partially reversible in the first cycle. However, Ti-O related compounds are developed during electrochemical cycling over extended cycles, which results in the decrease of the conversion reaction reversibility and the rapid capacity fading. In addition, the solid electrolyte interphase formed on the electrode surface is found to be highly dynamic in the initial cycles and then gradually becomes more stable upon further cycling. Such understanding is important for the future design and optimization of TiS2 based electrodes for lithium batteries.

Such designs are required for anode systems, especially for sodium-ion batteries where the capacity contribution from carbon is noticed. Herein, carbon-free TiO2 is prepared in the monolithic dendritic form via a facile single-step aerosol vapor deposition technique, grown onto a stainless steel current collector. The single crystalline nature of the anatase dendrites explicitly provides detailed crystallographic analysis. Herein, we have realized an escalation of the rutile phase with the existing anatase phase upon cycling, which is depicted as a moire pattern, while evaluating the structure through TEM studies. As the anode is carbon and binder-free, the overall material is electrochemically active, and hence appreciably improves the volumetric energy-density. Here, we observe a long cycle life of 1000 cycles from the additive-free anatase dendrites with an adequate capacity retention of 85.1%. Therefore, we believe that our single-step fabrication process to procure additive-free monolithic electrodes is a forthcoming paramount technique to produce sodium-ion batteries on mass.

ANALYSIS OF MERCURY (II) IONS DETECTION UNDER REDOX BASED MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMICALLY DRIVEN FLUID CONVECTION	MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMICS			English	Article							ANODIC-STRIPPING VOLTAMMETRY; PERMANENT-MAGNETS; ELECTRODES; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; ENHANCEMENT; STIRRER; SENSOR; STATIONARY; FIELDS; SCALE	Application of Redox-based magnetohydrodynamics to enhance the detection of mercury (II) ions has been experimentally investigated. Hg2+ ions at concentrations ranging from 0.375 nM to 1 mM in the presence and absence of Redox species, potassium ferric/ferrocyanide, under various magnetic flux densities were measured with linear sweep stripping voltammetry (LSSV) technique. When a voltage is applied across the working and reference electrodes in an electrochemical cell, a current density transmitted through the electrolyte solution results. In the presence of a magnetic field, the interaction between the resulting current density and the magnetic field induces Lorentz forces. The induced MHD convection enhances the ionic mass transport during the deposition and stripping steps, leading to larger stripping signals and thus higher detection sensitivities. The experimental results demonstrated that the stripping signals of the Hg2+ ions ranging from 1 nM to 1 mM are enhanced, respectively, by about 10-12% and 22-27% in the absence and presence of 1 mM Redox species K4Fe(CN)(6)/K3Fe(CN)(6) under the magnetic flux density B approximate to 0.71 T if compared to other identical conditions in the absence of the magnetic field. The detection limit for the mercury (II) ions using the LSSV technique in the absence of both the Redox species and the magnetic field is 0.875 nM, which is further reduced to 0.375 nM by adding 1 mu M Redox species under the magnetic flux density B approximate to 0.71 T. The presence of a supporting electrolyte, potassium chloride, shifts the positions of the peak currents corresponding to the mercury (II) ions. The research work presented is still ongoing to precisely locate the peak current of the Hg(II) ions vs. voltage and also to establish a functional relationship of the peak current as a function of the concentration of Hg2+ ions to quantify the mercury content in unknown samples. Thus, the usage of Redox-based MHD convection may enhance the sensitivities for the detection of heavy metal ions avoiding the use of traditional mechanical stirrers.

We synthesized both FA and MF using electrochemical hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis (ECH) of FF in acidic electrolyte using a Cu electrode. We investigated the role of concurrent side reactions including the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and polymerization of furanic compounds during ECH, as well as the potential dependence of the reaction pathway for ECH of FE As the magnitude of applied potential increased, both ECH and HER were promoted. Polymerization of furanic compounds was diminished by lowering the initial concentration of FE but at a cost of increased the HER activity. In contrast, higher concentrations of FF suppressed the HER, though excessive initial concentrations of FF resulted in lowering the activity of both ECH and the HER due to a polymeric film being formed on the electrode. The highest mole balances and faradaic efficiencies towards ECH were achieved at -0.5 V, though at the expense of lower conversions of FF than those obtained at greater overpotentials. We also found that the ECH of FF followed two parallel reactions to independently produce FA and MF on Cu in 0.5 M H2SO4 regardless of the applied potential.

This paper identifies a long-standing inaccuracy in the fuel cell modeling literature. Specifically, it discusses an inexact insertion, in popular models, of cell/stack current into Nernst's equation in the derivation of output (load) voltage. The origin of the inaccuracy is traced to the nature of reversible and irreversible potentials (equilibrium and non-equilibrium states) in the cell. The significance of the inaccuracy is explained in the context of the electrochemistry and thermodynamics of the fuel cell.

Corrosion Potential Modulation on Lead Anodes Using Water Oxidation Catalyst Coatings	COATINGS			English	Article						water oxidation; catalysis; electrochemistry; electrowinning; electrorefining; anode corrosion; electrocatalysis; cobalt oxide; manganese oxide	PB-AG ANODES; SULFURIC-ACID; ALLOY ANODES; PERFORMANCE; COBALT; METALS; POLARIZATION; ELECTRODES; DIOXIDE; SILVER	The oxidation of water to form oxygen gas provides charge balance for the cathodic deposition of metals, such as zinc, in the electrorefining industry. This is a corrosive, four-electron electrochemical reaction that causes deterioration of lead-silver alloy anodes employed in these processes. A sacrificial manganese oxide layer on the anode surface, formed in-situ from manganese sulfate, is used in industry to reduce the corrosion rate of these anodes by preferentially enabling water oxidation rather than lead dissolution. Still, it is poorly understood how the activity of manganese oxide as a water oxidation catalyst relates to its anticorrosive properties. Here, we show how the presence of water oxidation catalysts both formed in-situ (including the industry standard manganese oxide) and heterogenized prior to electrolysis on lead anodes affect the corrosion potential of these anodes. We find that corrosion potential under dynamic polarization conditions is the parameter most affected by the coatings formed in-situ and applied ex-situ prior to electrolysis.	[Kotyk, Juliet F.

We demonstrate the emergence of quantum confined behavior for the first time in atomically defined Co6Se8(PEt3)(6) superatoms by dimerizing [Co6Se8] units through direct fusion. To accomplish this dimerization, we install a reactive carbene on the [Co6Se8] core to create a latent fusion site. Then we transform the reactive carbene intermediate into a material with an expanded core, [Co12Se16], that exhibits electronic and optical properties distinct from the parent monomer. The chemical transformation presented herein allows for precise synthetic control over the ligands and size of these clusters. We show by cyclic voltammetry, infrared spectroscopy, single crystal X-ray diffraction, and density functional theory calculations that the resulting fused [Co12Se16] material exhibits strong electronic coupling and electron delocalization. We observe a bandgap reduction upon expanding the cluster core, suggesting that we have isolated a new intermediate in route to extended solids. These results are further corroborated with electronic structure calculations of a monomer, fused dimer, trimer, and tetramer species. These reactions will allow for the synthesis of extended highly delocalized wires, sheets, and cages.

Total Eradication of Bacterial Infection in Root Canal Treatment: An Electrochemical Approach	ACS BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE & ENGINEERING			English	Article						root canal infection; electrochemical treatment; Enterococcus faecalis; osteoblasts; 3D culture	ENTEROCOCCUS-FAECALIS; SODIUM-HYPOCHLORITE; FILLED TEETH; MECHANISMS; RESISTANCE; TITANIUM; ANTIBACTERIAL; OSTEOBLASTS; IRRIGANTS; SURVIVAL	According to the American Association of Endodontists, currently 22.3 million endodontic procedures are being performed annually with the success rate of 70-95% and the average survival rate of the root canal procedure is approximately 67% after 5 years and 56% after 8 years. One of the major reason for the failure is relapse of infection. Hence, it is imperative to develop an assistive or alternative method to eradicate the bacterial infection effectively without affecting patient compliance. The application of electrochemistry has been used previously to disinfect catheters and implant disinfection. Hence, the aim of this study is to utilize the principles of electrochemistry to develop a microelectronic device to eradicate bacterial infection for root canal treatment. The electrochemical protocol includes open circuit potential (60 s) and potentiostatic scan at varying voltage (-9 to +2 V) at a different time duration (1-5 min). Enterococcus faecalis in the form of planktonic and biofilm was used in this study. After electrochemical treatment, the bacterial viability was evaluated using alamarBlue assay, colony forming units, confocal microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. Cytotoxicity evoked by electrochemical voltage in comparison to NaOCl solution was performed using osteoblasts in 2D and 3D cell culture systems. The results of the study show that the application of -2 to +2 V at 1-5 min did not show any significant reduction in bacterial growth. However, the cathodic voltage of -9 V for 5 min showed a significant reduction (p < 0.001) in the bacterial count (80-95%). Similar results were obtained from biofilm study, which is more realistic to the in vivo condition. In contrast, the method did not induce cytotoxicity to the cells in 3D culture system (65% viability) in comparison to the highly toxic nature (0% viability) of NaOCl, indicating better patient compliance. Hence, the study provides supporting evidence to develop an electrochemically driven microelectronic device that can be a potential assistive dental instrument for endodontic procedures.

Koutecky-Levich plots were recorded at various temperatures between 23 and 60 degrees C. The calculated I-k values (representing reaction rate at infinite mass transport) were plotted as Arrhenius-type graphs, and the obtained energy values of 20-30kJ/mol depended on the potential chosen for the corresponding Koutecky-Levich plots. This led to the conclusion that these energy values are not activation energies, but rather an energy difference due to overvoltage as described in the Butler-Volmer equation. Accordingly, Koutecky-Levich plots recorded at various temperatures allowed to determine the Butler-Volmer kinetics including transfer coefficients even at low concentrations. Arrhenius plots obtained at heated micro-wire electrodes revealed two linear regions corresponding to diffusion control with 16kJ/mol at high temperature and 20-30kJ/mol at very low temperature. The latter activation energy values were found in a very narrow temperature range and probably belong to a transition region towards a kinetic activation energy.

Herein, we report the chemical transformations on the water-vapor/solid interface and catalytic performance of an OER catalyst consisting of Co3O4 nanoparticles on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (Co3O4-MINCNT). Using a specially constructed electrochemical cell incorporated to the lab-based ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) to mimic operando conditions, we obtained experimental evidence for the formation of CoO(OH) as the catalytically active phase on a Co3O4-MVVCNT OER catalyst. Under water and applied potential conditions, CoO(OH) is formed, enriching the surface of Co3O4 nanoparticles with subnanometer thickness, and oxidizing H2O into O-2. However, immediately after the removal of the applied potential, the CoO(OH) phase is converted back to Co3O4. This back-conversion from CoO(OH) to Co3O4 is likely driven by locally concentrated protons (H+) in water vapor, which shows the necessity of an electrochemical bias to preserve the catalytically active phase. These results reveal the surface chemical identities of the Co3O4-MWCNT OER catalyst, which are in agreement with those obtained from in-situ APXPS studies of liquid/solid interfaces consisting of Co3O4 catalyst and disagree with those obtained from ex-situ ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) XPS. Thus, our results demonstrate the possibility of performing surface chemical analysis in simplified electrochemical systems and further reinforce the importance of performing mechanistic studies of electrochemical devices under in-situ conditions.

Oxygen Pressure Influences Spatial NaO2 Deposition and the Sudden Death Mechanism in Na-O-2 Batteries	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							DISCHARGE PRODUCTS; NONAQUEOUS LI-O-2; SODIUM-AIR; CELL CHEMISTRY; ELECTROLYTE; LITHIUM; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; LIMITATIONS; INSTABILITY; CAPACITY	Over the past decade, metal-O-2 batteries have been intensely studied as potential high energy density alternatives to current state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries. Of these, nonaqueous Na-O-2 batteries offer high stability, improved full-cycle efficiency, and lower overpotentials, particularly on charge, when compared to the higher-energy density Li-O-2 system. However, Na-O-2 batteries exhibit sudden and large overpotential increases or "sudden deaths" on discharge, substantially limiting the achievable capacity. In this work, we examine the influence of O-2 pressure effects in Na-O-2 batteries and the mechanism of sudden death at different O-2 pressures and current density regimes. We observe that at a given current density, there exists a transition between failure mechanisms with O-2 pressure as a result of different phenomena related to the deposition of the solid discharge product, sodium superoxide (NaO2). Cells operated at a lower O-2 pressure are more susceptible to failure due to surface passivation resulting from thin NaO2 film coverage, whereas cells operated at a higher O-2 pressure achieve higher capacities but are increasingly subject to failure due to pore clogging from substantial solid NaO2 deposition. We associate the transition between these failure mechanisms with a combination of electron and mass transfer effects, leading to dramatic differences in the spatial deposition of NaO2 through the cathode.

The meso-aryl positions of the zinc porphyrin carried three penta-fluorophenyl substituents that made the zinc porphyrin ring harder to oxidize by 0.43 V compared with zinc porphyrin with meso-phenyl substituents. Two TTF derivatives, a first with a pyridine directly linked to TTF (Py-TTF) and a second with a phenyl spacer between the pyridine and TTF (Py-phTTF), were employed to vary the distance between the primary photosensitizer/electron donor, zinc porphyrin, and the secondary electron donor, TTF. Both Py-TTF and Py-phTTF coordinated via the pyridine entity to the Zn center with 1:1 molecular stoichiometry and moderate binding constants. The supramolecular triads were characterized by optical absorption and emission, electrochemistry, and computational studies. An energy-level diagram was established to realize the different photochemical events in the triads. Using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, it was possible to show that the coordinated TTF participated in electron transfer from the (1)(F15P)Zn* in the case of the C-60-(F15P)Zn:TTF triads to produce C-60-(F15P)Zn center dot--:TTF center dot+ charge-separated state competitively with the electron transfer from the (1)(F15P)Zn* to covalently linked C-60 to produce C-60(center dot-)-(F15P)Zn center dot+:TTF charge-separated state. The two charge-separated states, C-60-(F15P)Zn center dot-:TTF center dot+ and C-60 center dot-(F15P)Zn center dot+: TTF, were further involved in electron migration in the former case and hole transfer in the latter case to produce the C-60(center dot-)-(F15P)Zn:TTF center dot+ charge separated state as the ultimate electron-transfer product. Due to distal separation of the positive and negative radical ions, long-lived charge-separated states persistent for about 0.35 mu s was possible to accomplish, as shown by nanosecond transient absorption spectral studies.

Effective charge collection area during conductive and photoconductive atomic force microscopy	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							CURRENT-VOLTAGE CHARACTERISTICS; SOLAR-CELLS; ELECTRICAL-PROPERTIES; TRANSPORT; FILMS; POLYMERS; ELECTROCHEMISTRY	Conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) has been widely used to map the nanoscale electrical properties of conducting polymers, nanomaterials, and organic electronic devices. While these measurements provide valuable insight into the spatial dependence of electrical performance, reported current densities and electrical conductivities measured by C-AFM are consistently much higher than those measured at the macroscopic scale. Here, we demonstrate that these anomalously high current densities and conductivities arise from ignoring current spreading and hence underestimating the current-carrying area. We present a simple experimental means of estimating the effective charge collection area during C-AFM measurements. Using semiconducting polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) films as a test case, we find that the effective charge collection area can be as much as three orders of magnitude larger than the mechanical contact area between the probe and the film. Calibrated conductivity maps are obtained, with a quantitative correspondence with accepted values, and C-AFM photocurrent measurements of a nanostructured hybrid organic-inorganic solar cell active layer yield short-circuit current densities that match those reported for macroscopic devices. Finally, we address the observation that current spreading increases the effective charge collection area beyond the size of the probe-sample contact but does not preclude an imaging resolution below 10nm.

Perspective: How to understand electronic friction	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							METAL-SURFACES; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; ENERGY-TRANSFER; SEMICLASSICAL DESCRIPTION; IRREVERSIBLE-PROCESSES; RENORMALIZATION-GROUP; RECIPROCAL RELATIONS; BORN-OPPENHEIMER; MODEL; EXCITATION	Electronic friction is a correction to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, whereby nuclei in motion experience a drag in the presence of a manifold of electronic states. The notion of electronic friction has a long history and has been (re-) discovered in the context of a wide variety of different chemical and physical systems including, but not limited to, surface scattering events, surface reactions or chemisorption, electrochemistry, and conduction through molecular-(or nano-) junctions. Over the years, quite a few different forms of electronic friction have been offered in the literature. In this perspective, we briefly review these developments of electronic friction, highlighting the fact that we can now isolate a single, unifying form for (Markovian) electronic friction. We also focus on the role of electron-electron interactions for understanding frictional effects and offer our thoughts on the strengths and weaknesses of using electronic friction to model dynamics in general.

Controlled-Potential Simulation of Elementary Electrochemical Reactions: Proton Discharge on Metal Surfaces	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							HYDROGEN-EVOLUTION REACTION; DOUBLE-LAYER CAPACITANCE; DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL THEORY; OXYGEN REDUCTION; PH-DEPENDENCE; ATOMIC-SCALE; INTERFACE; MODEL; ELECTROLYTES; ELECTRODES	The simulation of electrochemical reaction dynamics from first principles remains challenging, since over the course of an elementary step, an electron is either consumed or produced by the electrode. For example, the hydrogen evolution reaction begins with a simple proton discharge to a metal surface, but with conventional electronic structure methods, the simulated potential, which is manifested as the metal's workfunction, varies over the course of the simulation as the electron is consumed in the new metal hydrogen bond. Here, we present a simple approach to allow the direct control of the electrochemical potential via charging of the electrode surface. This is achieved by changing the total number of electrons in the self-consistent cycle, while enforcing charge neutrality through the introduction of a jellium counter charge dispersed in an implicit solvent region above the slab. We observe that the excess electrons localize selectively at the metal's reactive surface and that the metal workfunction responds nearly linearly to the variation in electronic count. This linear response allows for control of the potential in simulations with a minimal computational penalty compared to standard electronic structure calculations. This scheme can be straightforwardly implemented with common electronic structure calculators (density functional theory in the present work), and we find this method to be compatible with the commonly used computational hydrogen electrode model, which we expect will make it useful in the construction of potential-dependent free-energy diagrams in electrochemistry. We apply this approach to the proton-deposition (Volmer) step on both Au(111) and Pt(111) surfaces and show that we can reliably control the simulated electrode potential and thus assess the potential dependence of the initial, transition, and final states. Our method allows us to directly assess the location along the reaction pathway with the greatest amount of charge transfer, which we find to correspond well with the reaction barrier, indicating this reaction is a concerted proton-electron transfer. Interestingly, we show that the Pt electrode has not only a more favorable equilibrium energy with adsorbed hydrogen but also a lower intrinsic barrier under thermoneutral conditions.

Theory of Water Desalination with Intercalation Materials	PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED			English	Article							HYBRID CAPACITIVE DEIONIZATION; PRUSSIAN BLUE; PHASE-TRANSFORMATION; ELECTRODES; INSERTION; THERMODYNAMICS; KINETICS; CHARGE; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; TRANSPORT	We present a porous electrode theory for capacitive deionization with electrodes containing nanoparticles that consist of a redox-active intercalation material. A geometry of a desalination cell is considered which consists of two porous electrodes, two flow channels, and an anion-exchange membrane, and we use the Nernst-Planck theory to describe ion transport in the aqueous phase in all these layers. A single-salt solution is considered, with unequal diffusion coefficients for anions and cations. Similar to previous models for capacitive deionization and electrodialysis, we solve the dynamic two-dimensional equations by assuming that the flow of water, and thus the advection of ions, is zero in the electrode, and in the flow channel only occurs in the direction along the electrode and membrane. In all layers, diffusion and migration are only considered in the direction perpendicular to the flow of water. Electronic as well as ionic transport limitations within the nanoparticles are neglected, and instead the Frumkin isotherm (or regular solution model) is used to describe local chemical equilibrium of cations between the nanoparticles and the adjacent electrolyte, as a function of the electrode potential. Our model describes the dynamics of key parameters of the CDI process with intercalation electrodes, such as effluent salt concentration, the distribution of intercalated ions, cell voltage, and energy consumption.

These complexes were characterized on the basis of their spectroscopic, electrochemical, and other physicochemical properties. X-ray crystal structure determination reveals that in complex 1, Cu(ii) is in a square planar geometry with the N,N,O-donor ligand and a terminally coordinated azide ion. In complex 2, however, Cu(ii) has a square pyramidal geometry, and apart from the tridentate Schiff base ligand there is a thiocyanate ion, which acts in a (1,3)-bridging mode, connecting the adjacent Cu(ii) atoms in an axial-equatorial fashion forming a one dimensional chain. Cyclic voltammetry shows that the complexes undergo Cu(ii)/Cu(i) reductions at -0.40 to -0.55 V followed by imine reduction at around -0.7 V. Cu(i)/Cu(0) reduction is observed at approximately -0.9 V. Complex 1 also shows appreciable catalytic activity for the aerial oxidation of 3,5 DTBCH2 to DTBQ (catecholase activity). Both the complexes also show strong binding affinity towards calf-thymus DNA.

However, the surfaces that are optimal for synthetic studies are not the same as the surfaces that are optimal for analytical studies. Hence, no one surface provides an ideal platform for both building and analyzing a molecular library. Fortunately, the synthetic chemistry available on a microelectrode array allows a surface that is ideal for synthesis can be converted into one that is ideal for signaling studies; a scenario that allows for the use of an optimized synthetic and analytical surface on a single microelectrode array.

It was accomplished by an innovative electrochemistry (EC)-mass spectrometry (MS) coupling, which can sample directly from a droplet-scale reacting electrolyte for mass spectrometric analysis. With this setup, the polymer chain growth of ANI could be monitored in situ and in real-time. The short-lived radical cations (ANI(center dot+), m/z 93.06) as well as the soluble dimer (m/z 183.09) and oligomers (m/z 274.13, 365.18, ...) were successfully captured. Using the EC-MS and tandem mass spectrometry, the dimers produced by head-to-tail (4-aminodiphenylamine), head-to-head (hydrazobenzene), and tail-to-tail (benzidine) coupling of radical cations were found in the same polymerization process. Moreover, the EC-MS method was also applicable for determining the propagation speed of ANI when applying different electrolyte salts and oxidizing potentials.

By using small nanoelectrodes as tips in a scanning electrochemical microscope (SECM), we recently imaged individual surface-bound 10-50nm metal NPs. Herein, we introduce a new mode of SECM operation based on tunneling between the tip and a nanoparticle immobilized on the insulating surface. The obtained current vs. distance curves show the transition from the conventional feedback response to electron tunneling between the tip and the NP at separation distances of less than about 3nm. In addition to high-resolution imaging of the NP topography, the tunneling mode enables measurement of the heterogeneous kinetics at a single NP without making an ohmic contact with it. The developed method should be useful for studying the effects of nanoparticle size and geometry on electrocatalytic activity in real-world applications.

This technique was applied to various photocatalyst powders, such as TiO2 synthesized in various ways to produce materials claimed to be active in the visible region (e.g. so-called "black TiO2"), in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor reactants. Hydrogen treated TiO2 photocatalytic powders do not show visible light photocurrents, and ammonia treated TiO2 photocatalyst powders can utilized visible lights photoelectrochemically although their incident photon to current efficiency, at 450, is two hundredths of that at 320 nm. Structural and elemental analysis of these types of modified TiO2 revealed that an amorphous layer and slight nitrogen doping on the crystalline surface provides the capability of visible light utilization for rutile TiO2. The generality of the technique with other particles (BiVO4, WO3) and its advantages over simple photodecomposition experiments is also discussed.

Dynamics of electrochemical Pt dissolution at atomic and molecular levels	JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Pt single-crystals; Structure-stability relationships; Oxide formation/reduction; Dynamics of dissolution; Dissolution mechanism; Pt redeposition kinetics	ELECTROACTIVE CONDUCTING POLYMERS; OXYGEN REDUCTION REACTION; SINGLE-CRYSTAL SURFACES; PLATINUM-ELECTRODES; CORROSION CONTROL; PERCHLORIC-ACID; GOLD ELECTRODES; OXIDE-GROWTH; NOBLE-METALS; DOUBLE-LAYER	Understanding and controlling electrochemical interfaces at atomic and molecular levels have transformed electrochemistry into a science with clearly defined fundamental principles leading to significant impact on various electrochemical systems and devices. Although the principles guiding the activity of electrochemical reactions are quite well established, the driving forces that control stability are still poorly understood. Here we utilize in situ monitoring of the early stages of Pt dissolution using the stationary probe rotating disk electrode technique coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SPRDE-ICPMS). Our unique SPRDE-ICPMS method provides picogram sensitivity levels that, in combination with STM, provide otherwise inaccessible information about the dissolution and redeposition of Pt(111) in acidic environments. We propose two distinct dissolution mechanisms that are active during oxide formation and subsequent oxide reduction. Whereas an electrochemical dissolution mechanism is observed during anodic Pt dissolution (Pt -> Pt2+ + 2e(-)), a combination of electrochemical (PtO + 2H(+) + 2e(-) -> H2O) and chemical (PtO* + 2H(+) -> Pt2+ + H2O) steps control the dissolution of Pt during the cathodic scan. The redeposition of Pt (Pt2+ + 2e(-) -> Pt) observed on the cathodic scan is controlled by a delicate balance between the diffusion of Pt2+ from the double layer and redeposition of Pte(2+) on Pt oxide-free sites.

J	Pathirathna, P; Balla, RJ; Amemiya, S				Pathirathna, Pavithra; Balla, Ryan J.; Amemiya, Shigeru			Simulation of Fast-Scan Nanogap Voltammetry at Double-Cylinder Ultramicroelectrodes	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							REDOX CYCLING AMPLIFICATION; ELECTROCHEMICAL MICROSCOPY; SELECTIVE DETECTION; OHMIC DROP; MICROELECTRODES; CARBON; ELECTRODES; HEMICYLINDER; ARRAYS; CONTAMINATION	High temporal resolution of fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) is widely appreciated in fundamental and applied electrochemistry to quantitatively investigate rapid dynamics of electron transfer and neurotransmission using ultramicroelectrodes (UMEs). Faster potential scan, however, linearly increases the background current, which must be subtracted for quantitative FSCV. Herein, we numerically simulate fast-scan nanogap voltammetry (FSNV) for quantitative detection of diffusing redox species under quasi-steady states without the need of background subtraction while maintaining high temporal resolution of transient FSCV. These advantages of FSNV originate from the use of a parallel pair of cylindrical UMEs with nanometer-wide separation in contrast to FSCV with single UMEs. In FSNV, diffusional redox cycling across the nanogap is driven voltammetrically at the generator electrode and monitored amperometrically at the collector electrode without the transient background. We reveal that the cylindrical collector electrode can reach quasi-steady states similar to 10(4) times faster than the generator electrode with identical sizes to allow for fast scan. Double-microcylinder and nanocylinder UMEs enable quasi-steady-state FSNV at hundreds volts per second as practiced for in-vivo FSCV and megavolts per second as achieved for ultra-FSCV, respectively. Rational design and simple fabrication of double-cylinder UMEs are proposed to broaden the application of nanogap voltammetry. (C) The Author(s) 2018. Published by ECS.

Operando Methods for the Mechanistic Elucidation of an Electrochemically Driven Structural Transformation	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; ACETATE; OXIDATION	We present the use of operando methods for the mechanistic dilucidation of an electrochemically driven structural transformation of a Ni(II) thioacetate complex. Specifically, we employed operando Raman spectroscopy and electrochemistry, along with X-ray diffraction to characterize the electrochemically induced conversion of a paddle-wheel tetrakis acetate dinickel(II) complex into the related dinickel acetate. Successive Raman spectra were obtained from the surface of a gold electrode immersed in an electrochemical cell containing the dinuclear complex [Ni-2(CH3COS)(4)center dot EtOH] under a constant applied potential, to oxidize the complex, and effects its conversion/transformation into the unprecedented [Ni(CH3COO)(2)](n) electrodeposited onto the electrode surface as microstructures. The crystal structure of the new electrogenerated compound [Ni(CH3COO)(2)](n) was also examined by synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The observation of a disulfide species, generated during the electrochemical process via Raman spectroscopy was consistent with and served to confirm the proposed mechanism. These approaches can be readily applied to numerous electrode potential-induced transformations.

Electrochemistry of Single Enzymes: Fluctuations of Catalase Activities	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article							NANOPARTICLES	Dynamic fluctuations of the catalytic ability of single catalase enzymes toward hydrogen peroxide decomposition are observed via the nanoimpact technique. The electrochemical signals of single enzymes show that the catalytic ability of single enzymes can temporarily be much higher than expected from the classical, time-averaged Michaelis Menten description. By combination of experimental data with a new theoretical model, we interpret the unusual enhancement of the single catalase signal and find that single catalases show large fluctuations of the catalytic ability.

Toward Small-Diameter Carbon Nanotubes Synthesized from Captured Carbon Dioxide: Critical Role of Catalyst Coarsening	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						carbon nanotubes; CNTs; electrochemistry; catalyst; coarsening; CO2; carbon dioxide	CHEMICAL-VAPOR-DEPOSITION; ELECTROCHEMICAL CONVERSION; ALKALI CARBONATES; GROWTH-KINETICS; FOREST GROWTH; MOLTEN-SALTS; IRON-OXIDE; ARRAYS; NANOPARTICLES; CO2	Small-diameter carbon nanotubes (CNTs) often require increased sophistication and control in synthesis processes, but exhibit improved physical properties and greater economic value over their larger-diameter counterparts. Here, we study mechanisms controlling the electrochemical synthesis of CNTs from the capture and conversion of ambient CO2 in molten salts and leverage this understanding to achieve the smallest-diameter CNTs ever reported in the literature from sustainable electrochemical synthesis routes, including some few-walled CNTs. Here, Fe catalyst layers are deposited at different thicknesses onto stainless steel to produce cathodes, and atomic layer deposition of Al2O3 is performed on Ni to produce a corrosion-resistant anode. Our findings indicate a correlation between the CNT diameter and Fe metal layer thickness following electrochemical catalyst reduction at the cathode-molten salt interface. Further, catalyst coarsening during long duration synthesis experiments leads to a 2X increase in average diameters from 3 to 60 min durations, with CNTs produced after 3 min exhibiting a tight diameter distribution centered near similar to 10 nm. Energy consumption analysis for the conversion of CO(2 )into CNTs demonstrates energy input costs much lower than the value of CNTs-a concept that strictly requires and motivates small-diameter CNTs-and is more favorable compared to other costly CO2 conversion techniques that produce lower-value materials and products.

Photophysical Properties of Pt(II) Polypyridines with Five-versus Six Membered Chelate Rings: Trade-Offs in Angle Strain	INORGANIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article							LUMINESCENT PLATINUM(II) COMPLEXES; TERPYRIDINE-LIKE LIGAND; ELECTRONIC SPECTROSCOPY; SQUARE-PLANAR; ARYL; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; SYSTEMS; SPECTROELECTROCHEMISTRY; PHOTOCHEMISTRY; AMINATION	This report describes the synthesis and characterization of a series of eight [Pt(NNN)X](+) complexes where the tridentate NNN ligand is (2,2'-bipyrid-6-yl)(pyrid- N 2-yl)sulfide (btp) or methyl(2,2'-bipyrid-6-y1)(pyrid-2-yl)amine (bmap) and X is OMe, Cl, phenylethynyl (C2Ph), or cyclohexylethynyl (C2Cy). The expectation was that inserting a heteroatom into the backbone of 2,2':6',2"-terpyridine (trpy) would expand the overall intraligand bite angle, introduce ILCT character into the excited states, and improve the photophysical properties. Crystal structures of [Pt(bmap)C2Ph]+ and [Pt(btp) C1](+) reveal that atom insertion into the trpy backbone successfully expands the bite angle of the ligand by 8-10. However, the impact on the photophysics is minimal. Indeed, of the eight systems investigated, only the [Pt(bmap)C,Ph]+ and [Pt(btp) C2Ph](+) complexes display appreciable emission in fluid solution, and they exhibit shorter emission lifetimes than [Pt(trpy)C2Ph](+). One reason is that the bond angle preferences of platinum and the inserted heteroatom induce the six membered rings to deviate from planarity and adopt a boat -like conformation, impairing charge delocalization within the ligand. In addition, angle strain induces the donor atoms about platinum to assume a pseudotetrahedral arrangement, which offsets any benefit due to the increase in overall bite angle by promoting deactivation via d d excited states. The results reveal that, in order to improve the luminescence of a [Pt(NNN)X](+) system, one must take care to avoid trading one kind of angle strain for another.

Here we applied a facile hydrothermal method to prepare fluorescent nitrogen and sulfur (N,S-)codoped CNDs using a-lipoic acid, citric acid, and urea as precursor molecules. This work describes a comprehensive study for exploring their antioxidation activity using UV vis absorption and electrochemistry measurements of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH"), as well as a lucigenin chemiluminescence (lucigenin-CL) assay. The lucigenin-CL assay detects superoxide anion radicals, i.e., reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced through the xanthine/xanthine oxidase (XO) reaction. The electrochemically derived relationship between the unreacted nitrogen-centered DPPH* and CND concentrations agrees with that obtained from UV vis measurements. A reaction pathway for the ROS antioxidative reaction of N,S-codoped CNDs is proposed. These findings should aid in the development of N,S-codoped CNDs for practical use in biomedical applications.

With a view to graphene-based sensing arrays and devices and, in particular, in view of graphene-based varactors for gas sensing, graphene was modified in this work by the a-n interaction-driven self-assembly of 10 pyrene and cyclodextrin derivatives from solution. The receptor compounds were pyrene, pyrene derivatives with hydroxyl, carboxyl, ester, ammonium, amino, diethylamino, and boronic acid groups, and perbenzylated alpha-, beta-, and gamma-cyclodextrins. Adsorption of these compounds onto graphene was quantified by contact-angle measurements and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Data thus obtained were fitted with the Langmuir adsorption model to determine the equilibrium constants for surface adsorption and the concentrations of self-assembly solutions needed to form dense monolayers on graphene. The equilibrium constants of all pyrene derivatives fell into the range from 10(3.4) to 10(46) M-1. For the perbenzylated a-, /3-, and ycyclodextrins, the equilibrium constants are 10(3.24), 10(297), and 10(295)M(-1), respectively. Monolayers of 1-pyrenemethylammonium chloride on graphene were confirmed to be stable under heating to 100 C in a high vacuum (2 X 10(-5) Torr).

In particular, electrocatalysis-a process that integrates electrochemistry and small-molecule catalysis has the potential to substantially improve the scope of synthetic electrochemistry and provide a wide range of useful transformations. Recently, we have demonstrated new catalytic approaches that combine electrochemistry and redox-metal catalysis for the oxidative difunctionalization of alkenes to access a diverse array of vicinally functionalized structures. This Perspective details our design principles underpinning the development of electrochemical diazidation, dichlorination, and halotrifluoromethylation of alkenes, which were built on foundational work by others in the areas of synthetic electrochemistry, radical chemistry, and transition-metal catalysis. The introduction of redox-active Mn catalysts allows the generation of radical intermediates from readily available reagents at low potentials under mild conditions. These transition metals also impart selectivity control over the alkene functionalization processes by functioning as radical group transfer agents. As such, our electrocatalytic difunctionalization reactions exhibit excellent chemoselectivity, broad substrate scope, and high functional group compatibility. Specifically, anodically coupled electrolysis, an approach that pairs two single electron oxidation events in a parallel manner, enables the development of regio- and chemoselective heterodifunctionalization of alkenes. The products of the new transformations we describe in this Perspective represent pertinent structures in numerous medicinally relevant compounds. We anticipate that the design parameters presented here are general and will provide a platform for the development of electrocatalytic systems for other challenging organic redox transformations.

Here, we demonstrate that these electrochemical mechanisms are linked to the mechanical response of the materials during intercalation of protons and present a pathway to utilize the mechanical coupling for local studies of electrochemistry. Operando atomic force microscopy dilatometry is used to measure the deformation of redoxactive energy storage materials and to link the local nanoscale deformation to the electrochemical redox process. This technique reveals that the local mechanical deformation of the hydrated tungsten oxide is smaller and more gradual than the anhydrous oxide and occurs without hysteresis during the intercalation and deintercalation processes. The ability of layered materials with confined structural water to minimize mechanical deformation likely contributes to their fast energy storage kinetics.

Rapid Two-Millisecond Interrogation of Electrochemical, Aptamer-Based Sensor Response Using Intermittent Pulse Amperometry	ACS SENSORS			English	Article						aptamers; sensors; binding kinetics; electrochemistry; intermittent pulse amperometry	RNA APTAMER; LABEL-FREE; AMINOGLYCOSIDE ANTIBIOTICS; VESICULAR EXOCYTOSIS; CYCLIC VOLTAMMETRY; BLOOD-SERUM; PERFORMANCE; ELECTRODES; MONOLAYERS; MOLECULES	In this manuscript, we employ the technique intermittent pulse amperometry (IPA) to interrogate equilibrium and kinetic target binding to the surface of electrochemical, aptamer-based (E-AB) sensors, achieving as fast as 2 ms time resolution. E-AB sensors comprise an electrode surface modified with a flexible nucleic acid aptamer tethered at the 3'-terminus with a redox-active molecule. The introduction of a target changes the conformation and flexibility of the nucleic acid, which alters the charge transfer rate of the appended redox molecule. Typically, changes in charge transfer rate within this class of sensor are monitored via voltammetric methods. Here, we demonstrate that the use of IPA enables the detection of changes in charge transfer rates (i.e., current) at times <100 mu s after the application of a potential pulse. Changes in sensor current are quantitatively related to target analyte concentration and can be used to create binding isotherms. Furthermore, the application of IPA enables rapid probing of the electrochemical surface with a time resolution equivalent to as low as twice the applied potential pulse width, not previously demonstrated with traditional voltammetric techniques employed with E-AB sensors (alternating current, square wave, cyclic). To visualize binding, we developed false-color plots analogous to those used in the field of fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. The use of IPA is universal, as demonstrated with two representative small molecule E-AB sensors directed against the aminoglycoside antibiotic tobramycin and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Intermittent pulse amperometry exhibits an unprecedented sub-microsecond temporal response and is a general method for measuring rapid sensor performance.

Charge transfer dynamical processes at graphene-transition metal oxides/electrolyte interface for energy storage: Insights from in-situ Raman spectroelectrochemistry	AIP ADVANCES			English	Article							HIGH-PERFORMANCE SUPERCAPACITOR; OXIDE POLYMORPHS; REDUCTION; GRAPHITE; HYBRIDS; PSEUDOCAPACITANCE; SPECTROSCOPY; SCATTERING; NANOSHEETS; MECHANISM	Hybrids consisting of supercapacitive functionalized graphene (graphene oxide; GO reduced graphene oxide; rGO multilayer graphene; MLG, electrochemically reduced GO; ErGO) and three-dimensional graphene scaffold (rGOHT; hydrothermally prepared) decorated with cobalt nanoparticles (CoNP), nanostructured cobalt (CoO and Co3O4) and manganese (MnO2) oxide polymorphs, assembled electrochemically facilitate chemically bridged interfaces with tunable properties. Since Raman spectroscopy can capture variations in structural and chemical bonding, Raman spectro-electrochemistry in operando i.e. under electrochemical environment with applied bias is employed to 1) probe graphene/metal bonding and dynamic processes, 2) monitor the spectral changes with successive redox interfacial reactions, and 3) quantify the associated parameters including type and fraction of charge transfer. The transverse optical (TO) and longitudinal optical (LO) phonons above 500 cm(-1) belonging to Co3O4, CoO, MnO2 and carbon-carbon bonding occurring at 1340 cm(-1), 1590 cm(-1) and 2670 cm(-1) belonging to D, G, and 2D bands, respectively, are analyzed with applied potential. Consistent variation in Raman band position and intensity ratio reveal structural modification, combined charge transfer due to localized orbital re-hybridization and mechanical strain, all resulting in finely tuned electronic properties. Moreover, the heterogeneous basal and edge plane sites of graphene nanosheets in conjunction with transition metal oxide 'hybrids' reinforce efficient surface/interfacial electron transfer and available electronic density of states near Fermi level for enhanced performance. We estimated the extent and nature (n- or p-) of charge transfer complemented with Density Functional Theory calculations affected by hydration and demonstrate the synergistic coupling between graphene nanosheets and nanoscale cobalt (and manganese) oxides for applied electrochemical applications.

Heterogeneously catalyzed two-step cascade electrochemical reduction of CO2 to ethanol	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						CO2 reduction; Cascade catalysis; Ethanol; Liquid fuel; Electrochemistry	AQUEOUS HYDROGENCARBONATE SOLUTION; BINUCLEAR RUTHENIUM(II) COMPLEX; SINGLE-CRYSTAL ELECTRODES; CARBON-DIOXIDE; VISIBLE-LIGHT; ARTIFICIAL PHOTOSYNTHESIS; METAL-ELECTRODES; COPPER ELECTRODE; ELECTROREDUCTION; CONVERSION	Electrochemical reduction of CO2 to liquid fuels is a promising route to a carbon-neutral, energy-dense storage of intermittent renewable electricity. However, electrocatalysts generally suffer from high overpotential and poor selectivity for multi-carbon products such as ethanol, and efforts to enhance such catalysts are limited by scaling relations which inhibit a simultaneous optimization of each elementary electrochemical step. In this work, the multistep proton-coupled electron-transfer reaction for the conversion of CO2 to C2H5OH was strategically divided into two independently optimized steps in a sequential cascade reaction using heterogeneous electrocatalysts to convert CO2 to CO and CO to C2H5OH within a single integrated electrochemical system. The exclusion of CO2 reactant from the second-stage electrolyzer was observed to be critical for maintaining appreciable ethanol selectivity. The cascade system produced C2H5OH at an overall faradaic efficiency of 11.0% at an average applied potential of -0.52 V vs. RHE, making it highly competitive with known single-step electrocatalysts for ethanol production from CO2. This performance was despite limited conversion of the intermediate CO between cascade steps (similar to 6.4%), and reactor design improvements to enhance the conversion could lead to significantly enhanced ethanol production performance.

Electrochemical characterization of high frequency stimulation electrodes: role of electrode material and stimulation parameters on electrode polarization	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						high frequency stimulation; stimulation electrode; nerve conduction block; electrode polarization; primary current distribution	CHARGE-INJECTION LIMITS; FINITE-ELEMENT-ANALYSIS; IRIDIUM OXIDE AIROF; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; CURRENT-DENSITY; NEURAL STIMULATION; METAL MICROELECTRODES; ALTERNATING-CURRENT; NERVE; DISTRIBUTIONS	Objective. With recent interest in kilohertz frequency electrical stimulation for nerve conduction block, understanding the electrochemistry and role of electrode material is important for assessing the safety of these stimulus protocols. Here we describe an approach to determining electrode polarization in response to continuous kilohertz frequency sinusoidal current waveforms. We have also investigated platinum, iridium oxide, and titanium nitride as coatings for high frequency electrodes. The current density distribution at 50 kHz at the electrode-electrolyte interface was also modeled to demonstrate the importance of the primary current distribution in supporting charge injection at high frequencies. Approach. We determined electrode polarization in response to sinusoidal currents with frequencies in the 1-50 kHz range and current amplitudes from 100 to 500 mu A and 1-5 mA, depending on the electrode area. The current density distribution at the interface was modeled using the finite element method (FEM). Main results. At low frequencies, 1-5 kHz, polarization on the platinum electrode was significant, exceeding the water oxidation potential for high amplitude (5 mA) waveforms. At frequencies of 20 kHz or higher, the polarization was less than 300 mV from the electrode open circuit potential. The choice of electrode material did not play a significant role in electrode polarization at frequencies higher than 10 kHz. The current density distribution modeled at 50 kHz is non-uniform and this non-uniformity persists throughout charge delivery. Significance. At high frequencies (> 10 kHz) electrode doublelayer charging is the principal mechanism of charge-injection and selection of the electrode material has little effect on polarization, with platinum, iridium oxide, and titanium nitride exhibiting similar behavior. High frequency stimulation is dominated by a highly nonuniform primary current distribution.

First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrates that the replacement of large anions, within a Co3X4 (X = O, S, Se) complex, can facilitate electron transfer through the reduction of the energy band gap (Eg) and the regulation of structural, electronic and bonding properties of Co-X, suggesting that the substituted Co3X4 in the following order O < S < Se can provide enhanced Na-storage capability. Accordingly, Co3X4 have been successfully designed, in which the selection of anions induces the evolution of microstructure, creating an enhancement of specific surface area with the effective introduction of defects. Note that the similar phys/chemical properties of anions within the Co3X4 possess analogous conversion mechanisms, further confirmed by in-situ XRD. Quantitative kinetics analysis reveals that the levels of the surface-dominated redox behaviors are greatly promoted by the decreased binding energy of Na2X (Na2O > Na2S > Na2Se) with the increased active sites, which are paramount for electrochemical properties. The work in this article sheds light on the in-depth understanding of the improved sodium-storage behavior with the advancing VI group anions and provides an effective strategy for the design of high-rate electrode materials for SIBs.

A biofilm is grown that extends across the gap connecting the source and drain. Potentials are applied to the electrodes (E-S and E-D) generating a source-drain current (I-SD) through the biofilm between the electrodes. The dependency of electrical conductivity on gate potential (the average of the source and drain potentials, E-G = [E-D + E-S]/2) is determined by systematically changing the gate potential and measuring the resulting source-drain current. The dependency of conductivity on gate potential provides mechanistic information about the extracellular electron transport process underlying the electrical conductivity of the specific biofilm under investigation. The electrochemical gating measurement method described here is based directly on that used by M. S. Wrighton(2,3) and colleagues and R. W. Murray(4,5,6) and colleagues in the 1980's to investigate thin film conductive polymers.

In this article, we report on the discovery of a new mode for liquid phase FEBID that enables growth of large metallic crystalline monoliths at exceptionally high growth rates (>1 mu m(3)/s) from water-dissolved metal salts using nanoelectrospray-induced non-equilibrium electrochemistry. Deposit morphology is controlled using the bias of the electrospray, with negative electrospray promoting crystallinity (as opposed to positive electrospray which results in granular deposits). Crystallinity is further promoted by elevating the pH of the electrospray solution. This approach opens a pathway for rapid direct writing of larger-scale monolithic metal structures using an electron beam. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Fisher, J. S.; Kottke, P.

Spatiotemporal Patterns on a Ring Network of Oscillatory Electrochemical Reaction with Negative Global Feedback	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Electrochemistry; Nickel; Feedback; Networks; Pattern Formation	ANODIC NICKEL DISSOLUTION; WAVE OSCILLATIONS; CLUSTER PATTERNS; SYSTEMS; SYNCHRONIZATION; BIFURCATIONS; TURBULENCE; BEHAVIOR; ARRAYS	The formation of spatiotemporal patterns in chemical systems can often be attributed to local and global interactions with the nonlinear kinetics, e.g., due to diffusion or an external constraint, respectively. We investigate the dynamics of an oscillatory chemical reaction on a ring of discrete elements, where the positive local coupling and negative global feedback can be varied independently to observe the emerging spatiotemporal patterns. With local coupling, the oscillations exhibit nearly in-phase synchronization. When increasing the global negative feedback, a transition is seen from nearly sinusoidal phase profile oscillations through rotating and standing waves to amplitude death behavior. The experimental studies are interpreted with a kinetic model of nickel electrodissolution. The results demonstrate the presence of rich spatiotemporal patterns that can be obtained in a network with positive local and negative global interactions.

Synthesis, electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical characterization of iron(III) tetraarylporphyrins containing four beta,beta'-butano and beta,beta'-benzo fused rings	JOURNAL OF PORPHYRINS AND PHTHALOCYANINES			English	Article						synthesis; iron(III) tetrabutanoporphyrins; iron(III) tetrabenzoporphyrins; electrochemistry; spectroelectrochemistry; substituent effects	IRON PORPHYRIN COMPLEXES; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; REDOX POTENTIALS; OXYGEN REDUCTION; SPECTRAL CHARACTERIZATION; ALKYLIRON PORPHYRINS; PYRIDINE BINDING; FE(I) PORPHYRINS; HIGHLY EFFICIENT; O-2 REDUCTION	Six iron(III) tetraarylporphyrins containing four beta,beta' -butano or beta,beta'-benzo fused rings were synthesized and characterized by electrochemistry and spectroelectrochemistry in nonaqueous media. The examined compounds are represented as butano(TpYPP)FeCl and benzo(TpYPP)FeCl, where TpYPP is a dianion of the meso-substituted porphyrin, Y is a CH3, H or CI substituent on the para-position of the four meso-pheny] rings and butano and benzo are the beta,beta'substituents on each of the four pyrrole rings of the compound. Up to three reductions are observed for each Fe(III) butano- and benzoporphyrin in C(H2)C1(2) or pyridine containing 0.1 M TBAP, the first of which is assigned in each case to a metal-centered electron transfer. The second reduction is also metal-centered in CH(2)C1(2) and leads to formation of an Fe(I) porphyrin, but it is porphyrin ring-centered and gives an Fe(II) porphyrin pi-anion radical reduction product when pyridine is used as the solvent. The effects of the solvent and type of fused ring system (butano or benzo) on the UV-vis spectra and electrochemical properties of the Fe(III) porphyrins are discussed and comparisons are made to both the structurally related non-beta,beta'-substituted iron porphyrins and earlier described butano- or benzotetraarylporphyrins containing Cu(II) or Co(II) central metal ions.

The (pyNO(-))(2)GaCl complex was prepared in 85% yield via a salt metathesis route and was characterized by H-1 and C-13 NMR spectroscopies, X-ray diffraction, and theory. UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy and electrochemistry were used to access the optical and electrochemical properties of the complex, respectively. Our discussion focuses primarily on a comparison of the gallium complex to the corresponding aluminum derivative and shows that although the complexes are very similar, small differences in the electronic structure of the complexes can be correlated to the identity of the metal.

Electrochemical oxidation of ciprofloxacin in two different processes: the electron transfer process on the anode surface and the indirect oxidation process in bulk solutions	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS			English	Article							GLASSY-CARBON ELECTRODE; DIAMOND FILM ELECTRODES; RING-DISK ELECTRODE; FLUOROQUINOLONE ANTIBIOTICS; VOLTAMMETRIC DETERMINATION; COMPOSITE FILM; ELECTROCATALYTIC OXIDATION; ORGANIC CONTAMINANTS; TREATMENT PLANTS; PASTE ELECTRODE	Herein, the rotating disk electrode technique was used for the first time to investigate the effects of mass-transfer limitations and pH on the electrochemical oxidation of CPX, to determine the kinetics of CPX oxidation and to explore intrinsic mechanisms during the electron transfer process. Firstly, cyclic voltammetry revealed that an obvious irreversible CPX oxidation peak was observed within the potential window from 0.70 to 1.30 V at all pHs. Based on the Levich equation, the electrochemical oxidation of CPX in the electron transfer process was found to be controlled by both diffusion and kinetic processes when pH = 2, 5, 7 and 9; the diffusion coefficient of CPX at pH = 2 was calculated to be 1.5 x 10(-7) cm(2) s(-1). Kinetic analysis indicated that the reaction on the electrode surface was adsorption-controlled compared to a diffusion process; the surface concentration of electroactive species was estimated to be 1.15 x 10(-9) mol cm(-2), the standard rate constant of the surface reaction was calculated to be 1.37 s(-1), and CPX oxidation was validated to be a two-electron transfer process. Finally, a possible CPX oxidation pathway during the electron transfer process was proposed. The electrochemical degradation of CPX on a Ti-based anode was also conducted subsequently to investigate the electrochemical oxidation of CPX in the indirect oxidation process in bulk solutions. The effects of pH and current density were determined and compared to related literature results. The oxidation of CPX at different pHs is believed to be the result of a counterbalance between favorable and unfavorable factors, namely electromigration and side reactions of oxygen evolution, respectively. The effects of current density indicated a diffusion- and reaction-controlled process at low currents followed by a reaction-controlled process at high currents. The results presented in this study provide better understanding of the electrochemical oxidation of CPX and would enable the development of new treatment methods based on electrochemistry.

The oxidation-and spin state of the iron complexes were characterized using X-ray crystallography, UV-vis absorbance spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and mass spectrometry. Electrochemistry results rank ligand L1-L3 as moderate tetra-azamacrocycle donors to iron between cyclen and Me2EBC-12. Characterization of the iron(III) complexes and subsequent catalytic testing indicates that the complexes enter the C-C coupling catalytic cycle in the highspin iron(III) oxidation state. Furthermore, the results indicate that the iron(III) complexes are essential for catalytic and regioselective production of the 2-phenylpyrrole product. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The complexes were obtained from the reaction of Mn(ClO4)(2)center dot 6H(2)0 with NNO tridentate Schiff base ligands HL1-HL4 synthesized from the condensation reaction of 2-(2-aminoethyl) pyridine and 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (HL1), 5-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (HL2), 5-methoxy- 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (HL3), or 5-nitro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (HL4) respectively. The complexes were characterized by spectroscopic techniques as well as by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Electronic effect of the substituents on epoxide yield was also investigated. The crystal structures of complexes confirm coordination of the manganese ion to the ligands through the NNO atoms of the ligands. The spectral changes observed as a function of time for the reaction of the complexes with aqueous (30%) hydrogen peroxide indicates possible formation of an intermediate product; hydroperoxo-complex implicated in the epoxidation reaction. The complexes catalyzed epoxidation of cyclohexene with low yield at room temperature but higher yield at 0 degrees C in the order complex 3 lower than 1, 1 lower than 2, with the Mn(II) complex 4 recording highest epoxide yield of 9% with turnover of 2.25 at room temperature and yield of 58% with turnover of 14.5 at 0 degrees C in the presence of ammonium acetate-acetic acid system/buffer.

Unlike commercial alkaline batteries with poor cyclic performance, the nanosized beta-MnO2 cathode in the mixture of LiOH and KOH electrolyte enables rechargeable reactions with high capacity. To unveil the underlying reaction mechanisms of nanosized beta-MnO2, we combine thermodynamic frameworks with experimental characterization, including electrochemistry, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results demonstrate a series of proton intercalation reaction (beta-MnO2 -> gamma-MnOOH) and two-phase conversion reactions (gamma-MnOOH -> Mn-(OH)(2) -> lambda-MnO2) during the first cycle and Li and H cointercalation in the host structure of lambda-MnO2 spinel during the 100th cycle. It is remarkable that the addition of Bi2O3 in the nanosized beta-MnO2 cathode exhibits outstanding capacity. After 100 dischargings, the battery demonstrates a capacity of 316 mA h g(-1). Our findings can serve in the tailored cathode design in high capacity and rechargeable Zn/beta-MnO2 alkaline batteries.	[Seo, Joon Kyo; Shin, JaeWook; Meng, Y.

Herein, for the first time, the authors design and fabricate a novel porous nanotube assembled with vertically aligned metallic MoS2 nanosheets by using the scalable solvothermal method. This metallic nanotube has the following advantages: (i) intrinsic high electrical conductivity that promotes the rate performance of battery and eliminates the using of conductive additive; (ii) hierarchical, hollow, porous, and aligned structure that assists the electrolyte transportation and diffusion; (iii) tubular structure that avoids restacking of 2D nanosheets, and therefore maintains the electrochemistry cycling stability; and (iv) a shortened ion diffusion path, that improves the rate performance. This 1D metallic MoS2 nanotube is demonstrated to be a promising anode material for lithium-ion batteries. The unique structure delivers an excellent reversible capacity of 1100 mA h g(-1) under a current density of 5 A g(-1) after 350 cycles, and an outstanding rate performance of 589 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 20 A g(-1). Furthermore, attributed to the material's metallic properties, the electrode comprising 100% pure material without any additive provides an ideal system for the fundamental electrochemical study of metallic MoS2. This study first reveals the characteristic anodic peak at 1.5 V in cyclic voltammetry of metallic MoS2. This research sheds light on the fabrication of metallic 1D, 2D, or even 3D structures with 2D nanosheets as building blocks for various applications.

As a result, the electron transfer, measured by electrochemistry, shows asymmetry in the reduction and oxidation rate constants; this asymmetry is reversed between the two enantiomers. The results can be explained by the chiral induced spin selectivity of the electron transfer. The measured magnetization shows high anisotropy and the "easy axis" of magnetization is along the molecular axis.

The molecular structure of 1 contains two units of S2Fe2(CO)(6) covalently linked to two thiobisbenzene groups to form a 26-membered metallocycle with the benzene substituents on sulfur adopting an ae stereochemistry. The Fe-Fe bond in 1 is 2.5046(5) angstrom which is close to that of the enzyme and related complexes. Crystals of 1 obtained from dichlormethane solution of [Fe-2(CO)(6)](2)(mu-4,4'-thiobisbenzenethiolato)(2) contain two dichloromethane molecules trapped in the cavity of 1. Infrared spectrum of 1 has peaks at 2071, 2030, and 1972 cm(-1) charateristic of the presence of the Fe-2(CO)(6) core.

Controlling Interfacial Properties of Lithium-Ion Battery Cathodes with Alkylphosphonate Self-Assembled Monolayers	ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES			English	Article						alkylphosphonate; lithium-ion battery cathode; lithium manganese oxide; self-assembled monolayers; surface modification	INDIUM-TIN OXIDE; THIN-FILM CATHODES; LI-MN-O; ELECTROLYTE INTERFACE; PHOSPHONIC-ACIDS; AB-INITIO; ELECTROCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION; SURFACE MODIFICATION; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; LIMN2O4	In this work, the preparation and characterization of modified LiMn2O4 (LMO) cathodes utilizing chemisorbed alkylphosphonic acids to chemically modify their surfaces are reported. Electrochemical methods to study ionic and molecular mobility through the alkylphosphonate self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) for different alkyl chain compositions, in order to better understand their impact on the lithium-ion electrochemistry, are utilized. Electrochemical trends for different chains correlate to trends observed in contact angle measurements and solvation energies obtained from computational methods, indicating that attributes of the microscopic wettability of these interfaces with the battery electrolyte have an important impact on ionic mobility. The effects of surface modification on Mn dissolution are also reported. The alkylphosphonate layer provides an important mode of chemical stabilization to the LMO, suppressing Mn dissolution by 90% during extended immersion in electrolytes. A more modest reduction in dissolution is found upon galvanostatic cycling, in comparison to pristine LMO cathodes. Taken together, the data suggest that alkylphosphonates provide a versatile means for the surface modification of lithium-ion battery cathode materials allowing the design of specific interfaces through modification of organic chain functionalities.

Electrochemical Measurement of Dopamine Release and Uptake in Zebrafish Following Treatment with Carboplatin	CHEMPHYSCHEM			English	Article						Brain; dopamine; electrochemistry; voltammetry; zebrafish	COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION; BRAIN; CHEMOTHERAPY; CANCER; IMPAIRMENT; TOXICOLOGY; DISEASE; STRESS; MODEL; FISH	Post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment, also known as chemobrain,' is a neurological condition in which cognitive function is impaired as a result of cancer chemotherapy treatment. In this work, we used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) to measure electrically evoked dopamine release and uptake in whole brain preparations from zebrafish that have been treated with carboplatin, an agent associated with chemobrain. We administered carboplatin by addition to the fish's tank water or their food. One week of treatment with 100M carboplatin in the water was needed to significantly impair dopamine release (approximate to 40% of control); however, only one day of treatment through the zebrafish's food was needed to cause a similar impairment. Atomic absorption spectroscopy measurements suggested that administration through food resulted in higher initial levels of carboplatin compared to water administration, but water administration resulted in an increase over time. Uptake, determined by modeling stimulated release plots, was unaffected. These results are consistent with our previous findings of diminished neurotransmitter release in rats and support a role for zebrafish in chemobrain-related studies.

Dynamics of an excess hole in the 1-methyl-1-butyl-pyrrolidinium dicyanamide ionic-liquid	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							INDUCED REDOX REACTIONS; SENSITIZED SOLAR-CELLS; SOLVATION DYNAMICS; ELECTRON SOLVATION; CONSTITUENT IONS; TIGHT-BINDING; IMIDAZOLIUM; CHARGE; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; PERFORMANCE	In a set of recent publications [C. J. Margulis et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 133, 20186 (2011); C. H. Xu et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 135, 17528 (2013); C. H. Xu and C. J. Margulis, J. Phys. Chem. B 119, 532 (2015); and K. B. Dhungana et al., J. Phys. Chem. B 121, 8809 (2017)], we explored for selected ionic liquids the early stages of excess charge localization and reactivity relevant both to electrochemical and radiation chemistry processes. In particular, Xu and Margulis [J. Phys. Chem. B 119, 532 (2015)] explored the dynamics of an excess electron in 1-methyl-1-butyl-pyrrolidinium dicyanamide. When electrons are produced from an ionic liquid, the more elusive hole species are also generated. Depending on the nature of cations and anions and the relative alignment of their electronic states in the condensed phase, the very early hole species can nominally be neutral radicals-if the electron is generated from anions-or doubly charged radical cations if their origin is from cations. However, in reality early excess charge localization is more complex and often involves more than one ion. The dynamics and the transient spectroscopy of the hole are the main objects of this study. We find that in the case of 1-methyl-1-butyl-pyrrolidinium dicyanamide, it is the anions that can most easily lose an electron becoming radical species, and that hole localization is mostly on anionic nitrogen. We also find that the driving force for localization of an excess hole appears to be smaller than that for an excess electron in 1-methyl-1-butyl-pyrrolidinium dicyanamide. The early transient hole species can absorb light in the visible, ultraviolet, and near infrared regions, and we are able to identify the type of states being connected by these transitions.

Lithiation of Magnetite (Fe3O4): Analysis Using Isothermal Microcalorimetry and Operando X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							LITHIUM-ION BATTERY; ELECTROLYTE INTERPHASE SEI; CRYSTALLITE SIZE CONTROL; GENERAL ENERGY-BALANCE; PARASITIC HEAT-FLOW; IN-SITU; IRREVERSIBLE HEATS; CELLS; CAPACITY; IMPACT	Conversion electrodes, such as magnetite (Fe3O4), offer high theoretical capacities (>900 mAh/g) because of multiple electron transfer per metal center. Capacity retention for conversion electrodes has been a challenge in part because of the formation of an insulating surface electrolyte interphase (SEI). This study provides the first detailed analysis of the lithiation of Fe3O4 using isothermal microcalorimetry (IMC). The measured heat flow was compared with heat contributions predicted from heats of formation for the Faradaic reaction, cell polarization, and entropic contributions. The total measured energy output of the cell (7260 J/g Fe3O4) exceeded the heat of reaction predicted for full lithiation of Fe3O4 (5508 J/g). During initial lithiation (3.0-0.86 V), the heat using polarization and entropic contributions. Heat flow at lower voltage (0.86-0.03 V) exceeded the predicted values for iron oxide reduction, consistent with heat generation attributable to electrolyte decomposition and surface electrolyte interphase (SEI). Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) indicated that the oxidation state of the Fe centers deviated from predicted values beginning at similar to 0.86 V, supportive of SEI onset in this voltage range. Thus, these combined results from electrochemistry, IMC, and XAS indicate parasitic reactions consistent with SEI formation at a moderate voltage and illustrate an approach for deconvoluting Faradaic and non-Faradaic contributions to heat, which should be broadly applicable to the study of energy-storage materials and systems.

The structure of this molybdenum(VI) complex has been determined by X-ray crystallography. The coordination sphere of the Mo center is approximately a trigonal bipyramid. The angles of the imido linkages (Mo-N-C) are 175 degrees and 147 degrees. The tridentate sma ligand binds with the imine nitrogen in the axial position trans to the 175 imido linkage. 1 can be reacted with bidentate aromatic ligands to form six -coordinate complexes of the type Mo (ArN)(sma)(L) (L = catecholate, 2; 2-mercaptophenolate, 3, 1,2-benzenedithiolate, 4; 2-amidophenolate, 5; 3-amidonaphtholate, 6; 1,2-amidonaphtholate, 7; 2-amidothiophenolate, 8). The structures of compounds 2-7 have been determined by X-ray crystallography. In 2, 3, and 4 the bidentate ligand, L, binds in two equatorial positions cis to the imido linkage. In 5, 6 and 7 L binds in an axial and an equatorial position where the amido nitrogen occupies the equatorial position. All complexes have been characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Compounds 2, 3, and 4 can be reversibly reduced with one electron to EPR-active Mo(V) complexes. The EPR spectrum of 4 shows superhyperfine splitting from the imido nitrogen. This indicates that the unpaired electron is located in the d(z)(2) orbital that interacts with the imido nitrogen and the imine nitrogen of the sma ligand and is not influenced by the bidentate aromatic ligand which binds in two equatorial positions. This explains the similar redox potentials of the three complexes. In complexes 5-8 the reduction is not reversible and the potential is influenced by the atom of the bidentate aromatic ligand trans to the imido group. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A Comprehensive Scope of Peripheral and Axial Substituent Effect on the Spectroelectrochemistry of Boron Subphthalocyanines	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	18th Meeting on Time-Resolved Vibrational Spectroscopy (TRVS)	2017	Cambridge, ENGLAND				ELECTRON-ACCEPTORS; BORONSUBPHTHALOCYANINE; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; DERIVATIVES; CHLORIDE; COBALT	An extensive study of the electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical properties of 14 boron subphthalocyanine (BsubPc) derivatives with various axial and peripheral substituents was performed in 1,2-dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) containing 0.1 M tetra-n-butyl-ammonium perchlorate (TBAP) as the supporting electrolyte. From the cyclic voltammetry results, all compounds exhibit one oxidation and at least two reduction processes within the solvent potential window of +1.6 to -1.8 V vs SCE. It was found that the reversibility of the redox reactions depends on the axial and peripheral substituents and the dipole moment of the boron-to-axial substituent. In general, UV-vis absorption spectra of the singly reduced BsubPc derivatives exhibit three equal intensity peaks in the 450 to 650 nm region that are derived from the maximum BsubPc absorbance peak upon reduction. Axial substituents affect the intensity of the three peaks upon reduction, while peripheral substituents shift the position of the peaks to higher wavelengths. Upon oxidation, the UV-vis absorption profile flattens considerably with only a single broad (similar to 300 nm) band apparent. Understanding the effect of substituents on the stability of the redox processes of BsubPcs will aid in further development of these materials for applications in organic electronic devices.

As such, they are developed and optimized using the same physical organic chemistry principles employed during the development of any other organic reaction. Certainly, the electron transfer that triggers the reactions can require a consideration of new "wrinkles" to those principles, but those considerations are typically minimal relative to the more traditional approaches needed to manipulate the pathways available to the reactive intermediates formed downstream of that electron transfer. In this review, three very different synthetic challenges-the generation and trapping of radical cations, the development of site-selective reactions on microelectrode arrays, and the optimization of current in a paired electrolysis-are used to illustrate this point.

The liquid transport performance in porous media can be significantly improved through the use of hierarchical morphology that leverages transport phenomena at different length scales. Traditional surface engineering techniques using chemical or thermal reactions often show nonuniform surface nanostructuring within three-dimensional pore network due to uncontrollable diffusion and reactivity in geometrically complex porous structures. Here, we demonstrate hierarchical architectures on the basis of crystalline copper inverse opals using an electrochemistry approach, which offers volumetric controllability of structural and surface properties within the complex porous metal. The electrochemical process sequentially combines subtractive and additive steps-electrochemical polishing and electrochemical oxidation-to improve surface wetting properties without sacrificing structural permeability. We report the transport performance of the hierarchical inverse opals by measuring the capillary-driven liquid rise. The capillary performance parameter of hierarchically engineered inverse opal (K/R-eff = similar to 5 x 10(-3) mu m) is shown to be higher than that of a typical crystalline inverse opal (K/R-eff = similar to 1 X 10(-3) mu m) owing to the enhancement in fluid permeable and hydrophilic pathways. The new surface engineering method presented in this work provides a rational approach in designing hierarchical porous copper for transport performance enhancements.

The presence of defects, such as cationic vacancies, locally disrupt the long-range order, with the appearance of local structures with order extending only a few nanometers. To probe and describe the electrochemical properties of cation-deficient anatase, we investigated a series of materials having different concentrations of vacancies, i.e., Ti1-x-y square x+yO2-4(x+y)F4x(OH)(4y), and compared their properties with respect to defect-free stoichiometric anatase TiO2. At first, we characterized the series of materials Ti1-x-y square x+yO2-4(x+y)F4x(OH)(4y) by means of pair distribution function (PDF), F-19 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies, to probe the compositional and structural features. Second, we characterized the insertion electrochemical properties vs metallic lithium where we emphasized the beneficial role of the vacancies on the cyclability of the electrode under high C-rate, with performances scaling with the concentration of vacancies. The improved properties were explained by the change of the lithium insertion mechanism due to the presence of the vacancies, which act as host sites and suppress the phase transition typically observed in pure TiO2, and further favor diffusive transport of lithium within the structure. NMR spectroscopy performed on lithiated samples provides evidence for the insertion of lithium in vacancies. By combining electrochemistry and DFT-calculations, we characterized the electrochemical signatures of the lithium insertion in the vacancies. Importantly, we found that the insertion voltage largely depends on the local anionic environment of the vacancy with a fluoride and hydroxide-rich environments, yielding high and low insertion voltages, respectively. This work further supports the beneficial use of defects engineering in electrodes for batteries and provides new fundamental knowledge in the insertion chemistry of cationic vacancies as host sites.

Bathochromic Shifts in Rhenium Carbonyl Dyes Induced through Destabilization of Occupied Orbitals	INORGANIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article							LIGAND SUBSTITUTION-REACTIONS; ELECTRON-TRANSFER; RIBONUCLEOTIDE REDUCTASE; PHENANTHROLINE COMPLEXES; CO2; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; SENSITIZATION; ROUTES; FLOW	A series of rhenium diimine carbonyl complexes was prepared and characterized in order to examine the influence of axial ligands on electronic structure. Systematic substitution of the axial carbonyl and acetonitrile ligands of [Re(deeb)(CO)(3)(NCCH3)](+) (deeb = 4,4'-diethylester-2,2'-bipyridine) with trimethylphosphine and chloride, respectively, gives rise to red-shifted absorbance features. These bathochromic shifts result from destabilization of the occupied dorbitals involved in metal-to-ligand charge-transfer transitions.

X-ray structures of complexes 1 and 2 reveal distorted trigonal-bipyramidal geometries with all nitrogen atoms of the ligand coordinated to the Co(II) center, in contrast to the common six-coordinate cobalt complexes with pentadentate polypyridine ligands, where a monodentate solvent completes the coordination sphere. Under electrochemical conditions, the catalytic current for CO, reduction was observed near the Co(I/0) redox couple for both complexes 1 and 2 at E-1/2 =-1.77 and-1.85 V versus Ag/AgNO3 (or -1.86 and-1.94 V vs Fc /), respectively. Under photochemical conditions with 2 as the catalyst, [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) as a photosensitizer, tri-p-tolylamine (TTA) as a reversible quencher, and triethylamine (TEA) as a sacrificial electron donor, CO and H-2 were produced under visible-light irradiation, despite the endergonic reduction of Co(I) to Co(0) by the photogenerated [Ru(bpy)(3)](+). However, bulk electrolysis in a wet CH3CN solution resulted in the generation of formate as the major product, indicating the facile production of Co(0) and [Co-H]n+ (n = 1 and 0) under electrochemical conditions. The one-electron-reduced complex 2 reacts with CO to produce [Co L-2(CO)] with vco = 1894 cm(-1) together with [(CoL2)-L-II](2+) through a disproportionation reaction in acetonitrile, based on the spectroscopic and electrochemical data. Electrochemistry and time-resolved UV-vis spectroscopy indicate a slow CO binding rate with the [Co1L(2)](+) species, consistent with density functional theory calculations with CoLl complexes, which predict a large structural change from trigonal-bipyramidal to distorted tetragonal geometry. The reduction of CO, is much slower than the photochemical formation of [Ru(bpy)(3)](+) because of the large structural changes, spin flipping in the cobalt catalytic intermediates, and an uphill reaction for the reduction to Co(0) by the photoproduced [Ru(bpy)3]+.

J	Li, Y; Ma, F; Wang, LW				Li, Yan; Ma, Fei; Wang, Lin-Wang			Phosphorene oxides as a promising cathode material for sealed non-aqueous Li-oxygen batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							ANODE MATERIAL; LITHIUM; PERFORMANCE; DIFFUSION; TRANSPORT; DENSITY; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; ELECTROLYTES; OXIDATION; DISCHARGE	A new type of two-dimensional (2D) material, phosphorene oxides (POs) in four surface oxidation states (P4O1, P4O2, P4O3 and P4O4), is evaluated as a potential cathode for sealed Li-oxygen batteries by combining the first-principles method with molecular dynamics simulations and implicit solvent models. The system can be sealed because, unlike open Li-air batteries, there is no need to take oxygen from air. Our simulations reveal that: (1) by forming a maximum number of Li-O bonds, Li can be tightly chemisorbed on the surface of POs with a large binding energy ranging from -2.32 to -3.72 eV and a charge transfer of similar to 0.9e from Li to O. (2) The diffusion of Li on POs is strongly anisotropic as the barrier along the armchair direction is nearly two times higher than that along the zigzag direction. The barrier dramatically decreases to 0.2 eV with increasing oxidation, indicating a high diffusivity. (3) For the P4O4 cathode, the thermodynamically stable, fully discharged product has a stoichiometry of Li : P : O = 1 : 1 : 1, achieving a specific capacity of 570.56 mA h g(-1), an average open-circuit voltage of 2.55 V and an energy density of 1457 W h kg(-1). The energy density can be further increased by considering solvent effects. More polar cyclic ethylene carbonate (EC) solvent brings about a larger energy density enhancement than less polar linear 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME). (4) Semiconductor-to-metal transition occurs within POs after Li adsorption, facilitating the electrical transport in PO-based batteries. A combination of strong Li adsorption, high diffusivity, and good conductivity makes POs great candidates for future fully sealed Li-oxygen batteries.

Here, we report the synthesis and structure of an SW corrole and its (SbX2)-X-v (X = Cl, Br) congeners. Sbui sits above the corrole ring, whereas Sbv resides in the corrole centroid. Electrochemistry suggests interconversion between the Sbm and (SbX2)-X-v species. TD-DFT calculations indicate a HOMO > LUMO+2 parentage for excited states in the Soret spectral region that have significant antibonding character with respect to the Sb X fragment. The photochemistry of 2 and 3 in THE is consistent with the computational results, as steady-state photolysis at wavelengths coincident with the Soret absorption of (SbX2)-X-v corrole lead to its clean conversion to the S13111 corrole. This ability to photoactivate the Sb X bond reflects the proclivity of the pnictogens to rely on the Pnilliv couple to drive the two-electron photochemistry of M X bond activation, an essential transformation needed to develop HX-splitting cycles.

Electrochemical Oxidation of Lithium Carbonate Generates Singlet Oxygen	ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION			English	Article						electrochemistry; lithium batteries; lithium carbonate; reaction mechanisms; singlet oxygen	BATTERY; CO2; ELECTRODES; CHEMISTRY; MECHANISM; CATHODES	Solid alkali metal carbonates are universal passivation layer components of intercalation battery materials and common side products in metal-O-2 batteries, and are believed to form and decompose reversibly in metal-O-2/CO2 cells. In these cathodes, Li2CO3 decomposes to CO2 when exposed to potentials above 3.8V vs. Li/Li+. However, O-2 evolution, as would be expected according to the decomposition reaction 2Li(2)CO(3)4Li(+)+4e(-)+2CO(2)+O-2, is not detected. O atoms are thus unaccounted for, which was previously ascribed to unidentified parasitic reactions. Here, we show that highly reactive singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) forms upon oxidizing Li2CO3 in an aprotic electrolyte and therefore does not evolve as O-2. These results have substantial implications for the long-term cyclability of batteries: they underpin the importance of avoiding O-1(2) in metal-O-2 batteries, question the possibility of a reversible metal-O-2/CO2 battery based on a carbonate discharge product, and help explain the interfacial reactivity of transition-metal cathodes with residual Li2CO3.

However, the progress of rechargeable Mg batteries has been greatly hindered by shortage of electrolytes with wide stability window, high ionic conductivity, and good compatibility with cathode materials. Unlike solid electrolyte interphase on Li metal anode, surface film formed by electrolyte decomposition in Mg batteries was considered to block Mg ion transport and passivate Mg electrode. For this reason, the attention of the community has been mainly focusing on surface layer free electrolytes, while reductively unstable salts/solvents are barely considered, despite many of them possessing all the necessary properties for good electrolytes. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate that the surface film formed by electrolyte decomposition can function as a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Using Mg/S chemistry as a model system, the SEI formation mechanism on Mg metal anode was thoroughly examined using electrochemical methods and surface chemistry characterization techniques such as EDX and XPS. On the basis of these results, a comprehensive view of the Mg/electrolyte interface that unifies both the SEI mechanism and the passivation layer mechanism is proposed. This new picture of surface layer on Mg metal anode in Mg batteries not only revolutionizes current understanding of Mg/electrolyte interface but also opens new avenues for electrolyte development by uncovering the potential of those reductively unstable candidates through interface design.

In this work, we prepare CuAg thin films with controllable compositions using electron beam physical vapor deposition. X-ray diffraction analysis indicates that this fabrication route yields metastable miscibility between these two thermodynamically immiscible metals, with the thin films consisting of a Ag-rich and a Cu-rich phase. Electrochemical testing in 0.1 M potassium hydroxide showed significant ORR activity improvements for the CuAg films. On a geometric basis, the most active thin film (Cu70Ag30) demonstrated a 4-fold activity improvement vs pure Ag at 0.8 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode. Furthermore, enhanced ORR kinetics for Cu-rich (>50 at. % Cu) thin films was demonstrated by a decrease in Tafel slope from 90 mV/dec, a commonly observed value for Ag catalysts, to 45 mV/dec. Surface enrichment of the Ag-rich phase after ORR testing was indicated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and grazing incidence synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements. By correlating density functional theory with experimental measurements, we postulate that the activity enhancement of the Cu-rich CuAg thin films arises due to the non-equilibrium miscibility of Cu atoms in the Ag-rich phase, which favorably tunes the surface electronic structure and binding energies of reaction species.

The SPECM screening study is successfully utilized to determine an optimal Co concentration of 6% to improve the photocatalytic performance of BiVO4. Subsequently, pristine and Co-doped BiVO4 thin film photoanodes are fabricated by spin-coating/drop-casting methods with optimal precursor concentrations of Co, Bi, and V to validate the results of SPECM. Structural characterization by X-ray diffraction shows that 6% Co-BiVO4 contains a photocatalytically active scheelite-monoclinic phase of BiVO4. Scanning electron microscopy images and EDAX show that 6% Co is partly incorporated into the BiVO4 lattice and the remaining accumulates on the surface in the form of cobalt oxide, which is further evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman studies. Co-doped BiVO4 thin film photoanode prepared by spin-coating method exhibits similar remarkable PEC response with similar to 150% increase in photocurrent density at 1.0 V vs RHE with respect to the pristine BiVO4 photoanode. Additionally, such photoanode exhibits a cathodic shift of similar to 200 mV in the onset of water oxidation photocurrent. The Mott-Schottky analysis confirms an increase in charge carrier density of Co-doped BiVO4 photoanode. Thus, the enhanced water splitting performance by Co is attributed to largely due to (1) enhancement in water oxidation kinetics via formation of cobalt oxide (Co3O4) on the surface of BiVO4, and partially due to (2) enrichment in electronic conductivity of BiVO4 in the presence of Co. An unbiased Z-scheme solar water splitting system is demonstrated at the end of this work by combining an optimized Co-doped BiVO4/WO3 photoanode with a CuO/CuBi2O4 photocathode in a two-electrode configuration.

In this report, we, for the first time, observed a magnetic response of the cryptochrome 1 (CRY1) immobilized at a gold electrode with illumination of blue light. These results present the magnetic field-enhanced photoinduced electron transfer of CRY1 to the electrode by voltammetry, exhibiting magnetic responsive rate constant and electrical current changes. A mechanism of the electron transfer, which involves photoinduced radicals in the CRY, is sensitive to the weak magnetic field; and the long-lived free radical FAD(center dot-) is responsible for the detected electrochemical Faradaic current. As a photoreceptor, the finding of a 5.7% rate constant change in electron transfer corresponding to a 50 mu T magnetic field may be meaningful in regulation of magnetic field signaling and circadian clock function under an electromagnetic field.

Pushing the limit of layered transition metal oxide cathodes for high-energy density rechargeable Li ion batteries	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							BINDER-FREE; LITHIUM; LINIO2; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; MORPHOLOGY; STABILITY; LICOO2; PHASE; NI	Development of advanced high energy density lithium ion batteries is important for promoting electromobility. Making electric vehicles attractive and competitive compared to conventional automobiles depends on the availability of reliable, safe, high power, and highly energetic batteries whose components are abundant and cost effective. Nickel rich Li[NixCoyMn1-x-y]O-2 layered cathode materials (x > 0.5) are of interest because they can provide very high specific capacity without pushing charging potentials to levels that oxidize the electrolyte solutions. However, these cathode materials suffer from stability problems. We discovered that doping these materials with tungsten (1 mol%) remarkably increases their stability due to a partial layered to cubic (rock salt) phase transition. We demonstrate herein highly stable Li ion battery prototypes consisting of tungsten-stabilized Ni rich cathode materials (x > 0.9) with specific capacities >220 mA h g(-1). This development can increase the energy density of Li ion batteries more than 30% above the state of the art without compromising durability.

Fluorinated Aryl Sulfonimide Tagged (FAST) salts: modular synthesis and structure-property relationships for battery applications	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							CONDUCTING POLYMER ELECTROLYTES; TRANSFERENCE NUMBER; LITHIUM; METAL; CHALLENGES; SOLVATION; LI-O-2; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; STABILITY; SOLVENTS	Solid-state electrolytes are attracting great interest for their applications in potentially safe and stable high-capacity energy storage technologies. Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) is widely used as a lithium ion source, especially in solid-state polymer electrolytes, due to its solubility and excellent chemical and electrochemical stability. Unfortunately, chemically inert LiTFSI cannot be easily modified to optimize its properties or allow for conjugation to other molecules, polymers, or substrates to prepare single-ion conducting polymer electrolytes. Chemical modifications of TFSI often erode its advantageous properties. Herein, we introduce Fluorinated Aryl Sulfonimide Tagged (FAST) salts, which are derived from successive nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) reactions. Experimental studies and density functional theory calculations were used to assess the electrochemical oxidative stabilities, chemical stabilities, and degrees of ion dissociation of FAST salts as a function of their structures. FAST salts offer a platform for accessing functional sulfonimides without sacrificing many of the advantageous properties of TFSI.

Environmental impact, life cycle analysis and battery performance of upcycled carbon anodes	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-NANO			English	Article							PLUG-IN HYBRID; LITHIUM-ION; ENERGY-STORAGE; GRAPHITE; NANOSPHERES; PYROLYSIS; SYSTEMS	For rechargeable lithium ion batteries, natural and synthetic graphite anodes come with great economic and environmental costs. Carbon microsheets, developed from used starch packing peanuts, are a carbonaceous alternative with great electrochemical performance and quantifiable environmental footprint. This work investigates how synthesis route (e.g., ambient inert gas or vacuum) influences microsheet electrochemistry and environmental impact. Carbon microsheets show gravimetric capacity greater than conventional graphite, with argon-derived microsheets demonstrating gravimetric capacity up to ca. 30% greater than vacuum-derived ones. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is used to examine the environmental impact of synthesis routes across standard midpoint TRACI categories (viz., ozone depletion, global warming, smog, acidification, eutrophication, carcinogenics, non-carcinogenics, respiratory effects, eco-toxicity, and fossil fuel depletion). Midpoint LCA illustrates that the impact of the vacuum process is sensitive to the origin of utilized energy. For instance, with respect to ozone depletion, vacuum pyrolysis produces less emission equivalents than its argon analog - assuming conventional domestic energy profile. In this sense, the context of energy should be considered alongside environmental impact in evaluation of process sustainability.

Fast identification of inorganic and organic gunshot residues by LIBS and electrochemical methods	FORENSIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Gunshot residues; Electrochemistry; LIBS; Firearm discharge residues; Forensic chemistry	INDUCED BREAKDOWN SPECTROSCOPY; ANODIC-STRIPPING VOLTAMMETRY; LEAD DETERMINATION; PERFORMANCE; HANDS; MS	In this study, electrochemical and laser-based spectroscopic methods (LIBS) are proposed as screening methods that are quicker, more selective and more effective than any current field-testing technique. These methods offer superior information by simultaneous detection of organic and inorganic gunshot residues, including a substantial number of elements used in modern ammunition. Moreover, the selected analytical scheme permits subsequent confirmatory analysis (SEM-EDS) on the same sample. The rapid scanning of the laser-beam favors the identification of up to 5 different emission lines per target element in less than one minute, with repeatability better than 11% RSD and limits of detection for the species of interest in the range of 0.2-200 ng. Optimization of the electrochemical sensors demonstrated the feasibility of Square Wave Anodic Stripping Voltammetry (SWASV) for the rapid detection of inorganic and organic target compounds using carbon printed disposable electrodes (repeatability less than 8% RSD, detection limits 0.1-1 ng/mu L, linearity > 0.991). The separation and detection of mixtures of Pb, Sb, Cu, DNT, and NG was possible after LIBS analysis, in approximately 3 min per sample. A set of 112 samples, 20 samples from non-shooters and 92 samples from 28 shooters, were collected as part of the validation study. Pistol (9 mm and .22) and revolver (.357 Magnum) were fired at indoor and outdoor shooting ranges. Metrics of performance, such as error rates (false positives and false negatives), specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy, indicate the combination of LIBS and electrochemical methods are a reliable and promising approach to advance current practice.

As part of an NSF-funded program, 21 graduate students participated in extended research visits to China, completing surveys before and after traveling, and participating in semistructured interviews upon returning to the U.S. These survey and interview data were qualitatively analyzed to determine how graduate student participants defined collaboration and how they positioned their own research experience in an international context. Data were coded using emergent thematic analysis via a first pass open-coding to generate a comprehensive list of descriptive codes for collaboration and then a synthesis of these codes through discussions guided by theories of situated learning in communities of practice. Findings suggest that all graduate students emphasized the importance of effective communication in collaboration. Graduate students also described collaboration as including at least one of the following elements: complementary expertise, shared goals, joint publications, and mutual learning. These findings provide insight into graduate students' experiences with collaboration, and, in turn, how to support graduate students so that they have successful international research experiences and collaborations with international colleagues.

Electrochemical devices like batteries and fuel cells can, in principle, exceed Carnot efficiency for energy conversion. In this novel laboratory experiment, students explore the partitioning of the enthalpy change of a battery's electrochemical reaction between useful electrical work and waste heat, Delta H = w(elec) + q. Work is measured by monitoring cell potential and current during battery discharge; waste heat evolved at the battery is simultaneously measured in a calorimeter. Results from discharging AA-size "alkaline" batteries are presented. Data for nickel-cadmium, nickel-metal hydride; a D-size, single cell, lead-acid storage battery; and Zn/Ag2O watch batteries are also presented in the Supporting Information.

Synergistic wear-corrosion analysis and modelling of nanocomposite coatings	TRIBOLOGY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Nanocomposite coatings; Synergistic wear-corrosion; Wear; Corrosion; Modelling	COMPOSITE COATINGS; STAINLESS-STEEL; NI; TRIBOCORROSION; NICKEL; NANO; DEGRADATION; TEMPERATURE; SIMULATION; MECHANISM	This paper presents analysis and modelling of synergistic wear-corrosion performance of Nickel-Graphene (Ni/ GPL) nanocomposite coating and compares it with un-coated steel 1020 under reciprocating-sliding contact. A novel synergistic wear-corrosion prediction model incorporating Archard description with nano-mechanics and electrochemistry was developed for Ni/GPL and steel 1020. The model is equally applicable to any kind of nanocomposite coating and bulk material like metals. For various nanocomposite coatings; their respective mechanical parameters should be used as inputs such as poisons ratio (v), Elastic Modulus (E), Hardness (H), Coefficient of Thermal Elastic mismatch (CTE) and intrinsic grain size (Do). The synergistic wear-corrosion effects were significantly-prominent in steel compared to Ni/GPL especially under contaminated lubricating oil conditions. This behaviour of Ni/GPL attributes to compact, refined grain structure leading to minimal grain pull-out during wear cycles which was also assured by less severe micro-ploughing in Ni/GPL compared to severe micro cutting in. steel. The predictions and experimental results were in good-agreement. Modelling of synergistic effects of wear-corrosion applied to nano-composite coatings have never been presented prior to this research. The significance of this work in terms of precision based wear-corrosion synergistic analysis, modelling and predictive techniques is evident from various industrial applications. This work will bring impacts for both in-situ and remote sensor based condition monitoring techniques to automotive, locomotive, aerospace, precision manufacturing and wind turbine industries.

Presented herein are early results of our efforts to synthesize beta-octaiodocorrole derivatives. Oxidative condensation of 3,4-diiodopyrrole and aromatic aldehydes failed to yield free-base octaiodocorroles. Treatment of copper meso-tris(p-cyanophenyl)corrole with N-iodosuccinimide and trifluoroacetic acid over several hours, however, yielded the desired beta-octaiodinated product in similar to 22% yield. Single-crystal X-ray structure determination of the product revealed a strongly saddled corrole macrocycle with metrical parameters very close to those of analogous Cu octabromocorrole complexes. The compound was also found to exhibit an exceptionally red-shifted Soret maximum (464 nm in dichloromethane), underscoring the remarkable electronic effect of beta-octaiodo substitution.

Iodine Coulometry of Various Reducing Agents Including Thiols with Online Photocell Detection Coupled to a Multifunctional Chemical Analysis Station To Eliminate Student End Point Detection by Eye	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						Upper-Division Undergraduate; Analytical Chemistry; Laboratory Instruction; Electrochemistry; Instrumental Methods; Hands-On Learning/Manipulatives	TITRATION EXPERIMENT	Multifunctional chemical analysis (MCA) systems provide a viable alternative for large scale instruction while supporting a hands-on approach to more advanced instrumentation. These systems are robust and typically use student stations connected to a remote central computer for data collection, minimizing the need for computers at every student workspace. MCA networks offer multiple measurement capabilities; however, constant-current coulometry is still an uncommon MCA option. The characterization of an assembled teaching coulometry instrument for online data acquisition using an MCA system is described. A constantcurrent source connected to nonisolated Pt electrodes in a 150 mL beaker serving as the reaction cell caused the iodine titrant to be electrochemically generated tor subsequent reaction with the analyte reducing agent. A photoresistor mounted on the stir plate below the beaker monitored the darkening of the solution due to formation of the starch-iodine complex. The change in voltage from an operational amplifier circuit permitted this titration curve to be stored by the MCA system for subsequent graphical analysis by Excel. Characterization of the instrument for direct analyte determination is performed with ascorbic acid, thiols, thiosulfate, and bisulfite. The number of electrons per mole of thiol for iodine titration of glutathione and N-acetylcysteine varied differently as a function of pH, indicating different reaction pathways. Ascorbic acid and the thiols are determined in dietary supplements with a recovery of 90-100%, and % RSDs of triplicate measurements ranged from 0.7% to 5%.	[Mercado, Jeralyne B.

Electron-transfer rates in molecular systems depend on a few fundamental parameters, such as interadsorbate distance, temperature and, in particular, the Marcus reorganization energy(7). This crucial parameter is the energy gain that results from the distortion of the equilibrium nuclear geometry in the molecule and its environment on charging(8,9). The substrate, especially ionic films(10), can have an important influence on the reorganization energy(11,12). Reorganization energies are measured in electrochemistry(13) as well as with optical(14,15) and photoemission spectroscopies(16,17), but not at the single-molecule limit and nor on insulating surfaces. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), with single-charge sensitivity(18-22), atomic-scale spatial resolution(20) and operable on insulating films, overcomes these challenges. Here, we investigate redox reactions of single naphthalocyanine (NPc) molecules on multilayered NaCl films. Employing the atomic force microscope as an ultralow current meter allows us to measure the differential conductance related to transitions between two charge states in both directions. Thereby, the reorganization energy of NPc on NaCl is determined as (0.8 +/- 0.2) eV, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide the atomistic picture of the nuclear relaxations on charging. Our approach presents a route to perform tunnelling spectroscopy of single adsorbates on insulating substrates and provides insight into single-electron intermolecular transport.

A combination of these techniques shows that in the early stage of the degradation process, amorphous arsenic sulfides are more stable than both crystalline forms, while upon longer exposure time, amorphous pigments will fade more than both mineral pigments, making it less suitable. While the stability study was carried out on unbound pigments, the influence of the organic binder on the relative degradation of the arsenic sulfide pigments was investigated through a multi-analytical approach on pigment/binder mock-up paint samples. For this purpose, the formation of arsenic trioxide was assessed by micro Fourier transform infrared (mu-FTIR) spectroscopy while the influence of the binder on the formation of sulfates was studied by means of synchrotron radiation X-ray near edge structure (mu-XANES). Both techniques elucidate a higher stability of all pigments in gum arabic while the use of egg yolk as binder leads to the most degradation, most likely due to its sulfur-rich composition. In the context of the degradation of arsenic sulfide pigments, other binders such as animal glue, egg white or linseed oil show an intermediate impact. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This design consists of multidimensional T-shaped microchannels that allow the effective formation of primary and secondary counter-flow patterns, which are beneficial for both high-performance regenerative H-2/O-2 redox cells and flow batteries at a low electrolyte flow-rate operation. This novel design demonstrates the potential to achieve high overall energy throughput and reactivity because of the full utilization of all available reaction sites.

Insight into Solvent Coordination of an Iron Porphyrin Hydroxylamine Complex from Spectroscopy and DFT Calculations	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Solvent effects; Coordination modes; Electrochemistry; Iron; Porphyrinoids	PICKET FENCE PORPHYRIN; NITRITE REDUCTASE; WEAK ACIDS; MECHANISM; NITROSYLS; NITROXYL	The reduction of Fe(OEP)(NO) in the presence of substituted phenols leads to a three-electron reduction to form Fe(OEP)(NH2OH), which has been characterized by visible spectroscopy and electron stoichiometry. In this work, we have further characterized this species using infrared and H-1 NMR spectroscopy, along with DFT calculations. The infrared bands in the 3400-3600 cm(-1) region, due to hydroxylamine, were significantly downshifted to the 2500-2700 cm(-1) region when 4-[D-1]chlorophenol replaced the normal abundance acid. Using H-1 NMR spectroscopy, the hydroxylamine and the meso-protons were identified. From DFT calculations, the H-1 NMR spectra were most consistent with a six-coordinate complex, Fe(OEP)(NH2OH)(THF).

Here, we first revisit the phase stability and electrochemical performance of LiCoO2 synthesized at different temperatures using density functional theory calculations. Consistent with previous studies, we find that the occurrence of low- and high-temperature structures (i.e., cubic lithiated spinel LT-LiCoO2; or Li2Co2O4 (Fd (3) over barm) vs trigonal-layered HT-LiCoO2 (R (3) over barm), respectively) can be explained by a small difference in the free energy between these 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 26 two compounds. Additionally, the observed voltage profile of a Li/LiCoO2 cell for both cubic and trigonal phases of LiCoO2, as well as the migration barrier for lithium diffusion from an octahedral (O-h) site to a tetrahedral site (T-d) in Fd (3) over barm LT-Li1-xCoO2, has been calculated to help understand the complex electrochemical charge/discharge processes. A search of LiCoxM1-xO2 lithiated spinel (M' = Ni or Mn) structures and compositions is conducted to extend the exploration of the chemical space of Li-Co-Mn-Ni-O electrode materials. We predict a new lithiated spinel material, LiNi0.8125Co0.1875O2 (Fd (3) over barm), with a composition close to that of commercial, layered LiNi0.8Co0.05Al0.05O2, which may have the potential for exploitation in structurally integrated, layered spinel cathodes for next generation lithium-ion batteries.

However, there is no generalizable method for characterizing a broad range of redox-active species in a single living cell at the resolution of cellular compartments. Although nanoelectrodes have been applied in the intracellular detection of redox-active species, the fabrication of nanoelectrodes to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of the probe remains challenging because of the stringent requirements of 3D fabrication. Here, we report an asymmetric nanopore electrode-based amplification mechanism for the real-time monitoring of NADH in a living cell. We used a two-step 3D fabrication process to develop a modified asymmetric nanopore electrode with a diameter down to 90 nm, which allowed for the detection of redox metabolism in living cells. Taking advantage of the asymmetric geometry, the above 90% potential drop at the two terminals of the nanopore electrode converts the faradaic current response into an easily distinguishable bubble-induced transient ionic current pattern. Therefore, the current signal was amplified by at least 3 orders of magnitude, which was dynamically linked to the presence of trace redox-active species. Compared to traditional wire electrodes, this wireless asymmetric nanopore electrode exhibits a high signal-to-noise ratio by increasing the current resolution from nanoamperes to picoamperes. The asymmetric nanopore electrode achieves the highly sensitive and selective probing of NADH concentrations as low as 1 pM. Moreover, it enables the real-time nanopore monitoring of the respiration chain (i.e., NADH) in a living cell and the evaluation of the effects of anticancer drugs in an MCF-7 cell. We believe that this integrated wireless asymmetric nanopore electrode provides promising building blocks for the future imaging of electron transfer dynamics in live cells.

The phenyl-PYA lead structure 1 was modified (i)electronically through introduction of one, two, or three electron-donating methoxy substituents on the aryl ring, (ii)by incorporating long aliphatic chains to the pyridyl fragment of the PYA unit, and (iii)by altering the PYA positions from para-PYA to its ortho- and meta-isomers. Electrochemistry indicated no substantial electronic effect of the aliphatic chains, and only minor changes of the electron density at iridium when modifying the aryl ligand site, yet substantial alteration if the PYA ligand is the ortho- (E-1/2= +0.72 V), para- (E-1/2= +0.64 V), or meta-isomer (E-1/2= +0.56 V vs. saturated calomel electrode; SCE). In water oxidation catalysis, the long alkyl chains did not induce any rate enhancement compared with the phenyl-PYA lead compound, whereas MeO groups incorporated in the aryl group enhanced the catalytic activity from a turnover frequency (TOFmax)=1600 h(-1) in the original Ph-PYA system gradually as more MeO groups were introduced up to a TOFmax= 3300 h(-1) for a tris(MeO)-substituted aryl-PYA system. The variation of the PYA substitution had only a minor impact on catalytic activity and revealed only a weak trend in the sequence ortho > meta > para. The high activity of the tris(MeO) system and the ortho-PYA isomer were attributed to efficient hydrogen bonding, which assists O-H bond activation and proton transfer. Remarkably, merging of the two optimized motifs, that is, an aryl unit with three MeO substituents and the PYA as the ortho isomer, into a single new aryl-PYA ligand system failed to improve the catalytic activity. Computational analysis suggests too much congestion at the active site, which hinders catalytic turnover. These results illustrate the complexity of ligand design and the subtle effects at play in water oxidation catalysis.

Introducing redox-inactive ions on the electrode surface minimizes deleterious side reactions without affecting the bulk properties. A synthetic challenge exists to grow such layers conformally at each primary particle, to fully passivate interfaces that are buried in the final electrode architecture. The development of methods of sequential colloidal growth of complex oxides and overlayers, enabled by surfactant interactions, would provide novel means to advance toward this goal. Here, nanocrystals composed of LiCoO2, a commercially relevant material for high energy devices, were grown with a shell enriched in Al3+, deposited conformally through a one-pot colloidal synthetic method. The effects of synthetic conditions on the composition of the Al-rich shell and the corresponding electrochemical performance were investigated. The modified nanocrystals showed enhanced electrochemical properties, while maintaining carrier transport.

Here, we report direct anodic electrografting of [Ni(alkynyl-cyclam)](2+) catalysts to the surface of GCEs in one simple step using inexpensive earth-abundant chemicals. When modified, these electrodes show reversible electrochemistry in organic solvents with zero peak-to-peak separations (E = 0) and non-diffusive I (V) profiles that are typical for heterogeneous redox materials.

Here, the design, fabrication, and electrochemical performance of fully 3D printed LIBs composed of thick semisolid electrodes that exhibit high areal capacity are reported. Specifically, semisolid cathode and anode inks, as well as UV curable packaging and separator inks for direct writing of LIBs in arbitrary geometries are created. These fully 3D printed and packaged LIBs, which are encased between two glassy carbon current collectors, deliver an areal capacity of 4.45 mAh cm(-2) at a current density of 0.14 mA cm(-2), which is equivalent to 17.3 Ah L-1. The ability to produce high-performance LIBs in customized form factors opens new avenues for integrating batteries directly within 3D printed objects.

Crystallographic Characterization and Non-Innocent Redox Activity of the Glycine Modified DOTA Scaffold and Its Impact on Eu-III Electrochemistry	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Imaging agents; DOTA; Europium; Cyclic voltammetry; Ligand effects	MRI CONTRAST AGENTS; LANTHANIDE COMPLEXES; TETRAAMIDE COMPLEXES; WATER EXCHANGE; NMR; DERIVATIVES; MACROCYCLES; DYNAMICS; KINETICS; BEHAVIOR	EuDOTA-glycine derivatives have been explored as alternatives to typical gadolinium-containing complexes for MRI agents used in diagnostic imaging. Different imaging modalities can be accessed (T-1 or PARACEST) dependent on the oxidation state of the europium ion. Throughout the past 30 years, there have been significant manipulations and additions made to the DOTA scaffold; yet, characterizations related to electrochemistry and structure determined through XRD analysis have not been fully analyzed. In this work, electrochemical analysis using cyclic voltammetry was carried out on EuDOTA derivatives, including the free ligand DOTAGly(4) (4) and the complexes. Effects of glycinate substitution on the DOTA scaffold, specifically, ligand interactions with the glassy carbon electrode were observed. A range of electrochemical investigations were carried out to show that increased glycinate substitution led to increased interaction with the electrode surface, thus implicating a new factor to consider when evaluating the electrochemistry of glycinate substituted ligands. In addition, the solid-state structure of EuDOTAGly(4) (Eu4) was determined by X-ray diffraction and a brief analysis is presented compared to known Ln(3+) structures found within literature. The Eu4 complex crystalizes in a rare polymer type arrangement via bridging side-arms between adjacent complexes.

Accurate Ionization Energies for Mononuclear Copper Complexes Remain a Challenge for Density Functional Theory	CHEMPHYSCHEM			English	Article						copper; density functional calculations; ionization energy; relativistic effects; wave function theory	TRANSITION-METAL-COMPLEXES; GENERALIZED GRADIENT APPROXIMATION; REDOX POTENTIALS; WATER-OXIDATION; COMPUTATIONAL ELECTROCHEMISTRY; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; REDUCTION POTENTIALS; BIOINORGANIC SYSTEMS; ACTIVE-SITES; BASIS-SETS	Copper is ubiquitous and its one-electron redox chemistry is central to many catalytic processes. Modeling such chemistry requires electronic structure methods capable of the accurate prediction of ionization energies (IEs) for compounds including copper in different oxidation states and supported by various ligands. Herein, we estimate IEs for 12 mononuclear Cu species previously reported in the literature by using 21 modern density functionals and the DLPNO-CCSD(T) wave function theory model; we consider extrapolated values of the latter to provide reference values of acceptable accuracy. Our results reveal a considerable diversity in functional performance. Although there is nearly always at least one functional that performs well for any given species, there are none that do so for every member of the test set, and certain cases are particularly pathological. Over the entire test set, the SOGGA11-X functional performs best with a mean unsigned error (MUE) of 0.22eV. PBE0, B97X-D, CAM-B3LYP, M11-L, B3LYP, and M11 exhibit MUEs ranging between 0.23 and 0.34eV. When including relativistic effects with the zero-order regular approximation, B97X-D, CAM-B3LYP, and PBE0 are found to provide the best accuracy.

Improving accuracy of electrochemical capacitance and solvation energetics in first-principles calculations	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS; SINGLE-CRYSTAL ELECTRODES; DOUBLE-LAYER; ELECTRIFIED INTERFACES; CONTINUUM SOLVATION; POTENTIALS; APPROXIMATION; ELECTROLYTES; INTERPHASE; ADSORPTION	Reliable first-principles calculations of electrochemical processes require accurate prediction of the interfacial capacitance, a challenge for current computationally efficient continuum solvation methodologies. We develop a model for the double layer of a metallic electrode that reproduces the features of the experimental capacitance of Ag(100) in a non-adsorbing, aqueous electrolyte, including a broad hump in the capacitance near the potential of zero charge and a dip in the capacitance under conditions of low ionic strength. Using this model, we identify the necessary characteristics of a solvation model suitable for first-principles electrochemistry of metal surfaces in non-adsorbing, aqueous electrolytes: dielectric and ionic nonlinearity, and a dielectric-only region at the interface. The dielectric nonlinearity, caused by the saturation of dipole rotational response in water, creates the capacitance hump, while ionic nonlinearity, caused by the compactness of the diffuse layer, generates the capacitance dip seen at low ionic strength. We show that none of the previously developed solvation models simultaneously meet all these criteria. We design the nonlinear electrochemical soft-sphere solvation model which both captures the capacitance features observed experimentally and serves as a general-purpose continuum solvation model.

Dynamic and Tunable Threshold Voltage in Organic Electrochemical Transistors	ADVANCED MATERIALS			English	Article						organic electrochemical transistors; organic electronics; printed electronics; threshold voltage	TRANSCONDUCTANCE; MODE	In recent years, organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have found applications in chemical and biological sensing and interfacing, neuromorphic computing, digital logic, and printed electronics. However, the incorporation of OECTs in practical electronic circuits is limited by the relative lack of control over their threshold voltage, which is important for controlling the power consumption and noise margin in complementary and unipolar circuits. Here, the threshold voltage of OECTs is precisely tuned over a range of more than 1 V by chemically controlling the electrochemical potential at the gate electrode. This threshold voltage tunability is exploited to prepare inverters and amplifiers with improved noise margin and gain, respectively. By coupling the gate electrode with an electrochemical oscillator, single-transistor oscillators based on OECTs with dynamic time-varying threshold voltages are prepared. This work highlights the importance of electrochemistry at the gate electrode in determining the electrical properties of OECTs, and opens a path toward the system-level design of low-power OECT-based electronics.

Here, a facile method to form plasmonic molecular junctions is reported by utilizing single gold nanoparticle (NP) collision events at a highly curved gold nanoelectrode modified with a self-assembled monolayer. By using time-resolved electrochemical current measurement and surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy, the current changes and the evolution of interfacial chemical bonding are successfully observed in the newly formed molecular tunnel junctions during and after the gold NP hit-n-stay and hit-n-run collision events. The results lead to an in-depth understanding of the single NP motion and the associated molecular level changes during the formation of the plasmonic molecular junctions in a single NP collision event. This method also provides a new platform to study molecular changes at the single molecule level during electron transport in a dynamic molecular tunnel junction.

In this report, we present the fabrication and spectroelectrochemistry characteristics of light-scattering single Au NP at the tip of an electrochemically etched sharp tungsten (W) electrode. Au NPs with a tunable particle size (>= 60 nm) can be obtained at the Wtips by adjusting the Au electrodeposition conditions. Catalyzed electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) from Tris(2,2'-bipyridine) ruthenium (II) (Ru(bpy)(3)(2+))/ Tri-n-propylamine (TPrA) system at single Au NP electrode shows an increase in its intensity with Au NP particle size in the range of 300 nm-500 nm. The potential application of these single Au NP electrodes in the studies of electrocatalytic reaction and spectroelectrochemistry at the nanometer scale is demonstrated using dark-field scattering (DFS) spectroelectrochemistry method. The decrease in DFS intensity upon oxidation of hydrazine at the single Au NP electrode is attributed to the formation of low-refraction-index N-2 near the surface of the Au NP to decrease its light scattering cross-section. Single Au NP electrode presented in this work would help improve instrument capability of scanning electrochemical microscope (SECM) and near-field scanning optical microscope (NSOM) techniques for ultrasensitive electrochemical analysis.

To gain insight into the exfoliation possibility of MAX phases and to identify which MAX phases are promising candidates for successful exfoliation into 2D MXenes, we perform extensive electronic structure and phonon calculations, and determine the force constants, bond strengths, and static exfoliation energies of MAX phases to MXenes for 82 different experimentally synthesized crystalline MAX phases. Our results show a clear correlation between the force constants and the bond strengths. As the total force constant of an A atom contributed from the neighboring atoms is smaller, the exfoliation energy becomes smaller, thus making exfoliation easier. We propose 37 MAX phases for successful exfoliation into 2D Ti2C, Ti3C2, Ti4C3, Ti5C4, Ti2N, Zr2C, Hf2C, V2C, V3C2, V4C3, Nb2C, Nb5C4, Ta2C, Ta5C4, Cr2C, Cr2N, and Mo2C MXenes. In addition, we explore the effect of charge injection on MAX phases. We find that the injected charges, both electrons and holes, are mainly received by the transition metals. This is due to the electronic property of MAX phases that the states near the Fermi energy are mainly dominated by d orbitals of the transition metals. For negatively charged MAX phases, the electrons injected cause swelling of the structure and elongation of the bond distances along the c axis, which hence weakens the binding. For positively charged MAX phases, on the other hand, the bonds become shorter and stronger. Therefore, we predict that the electron injection by electrochemistry or gating techniques can significantly facilitate the exfoliation possibility of MAX phases to 2D MXenes.

Hydrogen evolution by cobalt hangman porphyrins under operating conditions studied by vibrational spectro-electrochemistry	CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							RESONANCE RAMAN-SPECTROSCOPY; ELECTROCATALYTIC OXYGEN REDUCTION; COUPLED ELECTRON-TRANSFER; CYTOCHROME-C-OXIDASE; NEUTRAL AQUEOUS-SOLUTION; WATER OXIDATION; THEORETICAL-ANALYSIS; NICKEL PORPHYRINS; MOLECULAR-SYSTEMS; HEME-PROTEINS	Cobalt hangman complexes are promising catalysts for dihydrogen production, yet their electrocatalytic performance in aqueous environment is still a topic of dispute. Surface-enhanced resonance Raman (SERR) spectro-electrochemistry has a great potential to give insight into the reaction mechanism of such molecular catalysts attached to electrodes under turnover conditions. However, the intrinsic catalytic activity of plasmonic supports and photoinduced side-reactions make the in situ analysis of their structures very challenging. In this work, the structure of hangman complexes attached to electrodes via dip-coating was investigated during catalytic turnover by electrochemistry and SERR spectroscopy. In order to explore the relevance of the hanging group for proton supply, complexes bearing a carboxylic acid and an ester hanging group were compared. For the former, SERR spectra recorded under turnover conditions indicate the reductive formation of a Co-III-H species, followed by laser-induced translocation of a proton to the carboxylic hanging group and the associated formation of the CoI state. Due to the lack of a proton accepting group, hangman complexes with an ester group could not be trapped in the Co-I intermediate state and as a consequence SERR spectra solely reflected the (photo-enriched) Co-II resting state under turnover conditions. These results represent the first Raman spectroscopic insights into intermediates of dihydrogen evolution catalysed by cobalt hangman complexes on electrodes and support the direct involvement of the hanging group as a proton shuttle.

The results obtained highlight the importance of the peptidic sequence on the coordination properties and, consequently, on the redox properties of their Cu-II complexes. For Cu-II-HAH and Cu-II-HWH, no cathodic processes are observed up to -1.2V; that is, the complexes exhibit very high stability towards copper reduction. This behaviour is associated with the formation of very stable square-planar (5,5,6)-membered chelate rings (ATCUN motif), which enclose two deprotonated amides. In contrast, for non-ATCUN Cu-II-Ac-HWH, Cu-II-HHW complexes, simulations seem to indicate that only one deprotonated amide is enclosed in the coordination sphere. In these cases, the main electrochemical feature is a reductive irreversible one electron-transfer process from Cu-II to Cu-I, accompanied with structural changes of the metal coordination sphere and reprotonation of the amide. Finally, for Cu-II-WHH, two major species have been detected: one at low pH (< 5), with no deprotonated amides, and another one at high pH (> 10) with an ATCUN motif, both species coexisting at intermediate pH. The present study shows that the use of CV, using glassy carbon as a working electrode, is an ideal and rapid tool for the determination of the redox properties of Cu-II metallopeptides.

In addition, on-line MS monitoring of the oxidations allowed evaluation of DOPA and Adr oxidation kinetics with approximately 3ms time resolution. Kinetic information was confirmed by on-line electrochemistry/ESI MS (EC/ESI MS). Application of an EC cell voltage in EC/ESI MS increased the oxidation rates and MS detection sensitivity of intermediates. During ESI and EC/ESI MS, oxidation rates were DOPA<Adr<<dopamine(DA), cyclization rates of quinone oxidation products were Adr >> DOPA>DA, and cyclic leucochrome oxidation rates were DA>Adr>DOPA. Formation of radical semiquinones of Adr and DOPA through OH center dot radical-initiated oxidation pathways was indicated, as reported for DA. Images of catecholamine oxidation pathways obtained with high time resolution, using MS, underscore the differences between the reactivity of DOPA, Adr, and DA.

In this work we report some effects of graphene sheet dimensions on the properties of GAs. Nanographene aerogels (nG-AGs) were synthesized using nanographene oxide (nGO) powder with a mean platelet diameter of 90nm. In-situ Fourier tranformation infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy during gelation revealed a longer fast-gelation regime for nG-AGs than for standard graphene aerogels (stdG-AGs). The surface-area-normalized capacitance of nG-AGs calculated from cyclic voltammetry is 16% higher than that of stdG-AGs, and the onset of hydrogen evolution is observed at a lower over-potential. These observations can be attributed to an increased density of edge sites and defects in nanographene sheets. Our results indicate that the diameter of the precursor graphene sheets can be used as a parameter to optimize the electrochemical properties of GAs depending on the application.

To trace the source of these differences, PEDOT(PSS) films were deposited under the same conditions onto Au and Pt electrodes on the surface of 10MHz quartz crystals. During the galvanostatic polymerization, the frequency decrease of the quartz crystal was monitored by an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM). In the initial 15seconds of the electrochemical deposition, the rate of PEDOT(PSS) polymer growth was significantly faster on Au compared to Pt although the current density used for the deposition was the same. Consequently, the total frequency change after a given electrolysis time was always larger on Au compared to Pt, indicating a larger deposited mass or PEDOT(PSS) layer thickness. The differences in the thicknesses of the PEDOT(PSS) films on Au and Pt could be quantitatively confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) etching studies. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of PEDOT(PSS) films on Au and Pt also showed characteristic differences.

J	Chen, HB; An, LJ; Nakamura, I				Chen, Hongbo; An, Lijia; Nakamura, Issei			Water dissolution in ionic liquids between charged surfaces: effects of electric polarization and electrostatic correlation	MOLECULAR SYSTEMS DESIGN & ENGINEERING			English	Article							STATIC DIELECTRIC-CONSTANT; DOUBLE-LAYER; FIELD-THEORY; INTERFACE; CATION; CAPACITANCE; SATURATION; SOLVATION; MECHANISM; MIXTURES	Water dissolved in ionic liquids garners particular attention in electrochemistry, as represented by the case where water molecules cannot be completely removed from ionic liquids. Nevertheless, the effects of such polarizable polar molecules on the energy efficiency of electrochemical devices remain elusive. Thus, we highlight the effects of the spatially varying dielectric response of water and ionic liquid near charged plates using a coarse-grained mean-field theory that simultaneously accounts for both the permanent and induced dipole moments of the species and the strong electrostatic correlation. We show that water can be adsorbed onto electrodes primarily because of the dielectric contrast between the species. Our results predict that linear-dielectric theory is inadequate to account for the correlation between the capacitance and dielectric contrast, which may be fitted by exponential functions. Electronic polarizability can enhance the capacitance. A higher-dielectric component preferentially solvates electrodes, but this effect competes with that of the charge screening. Our theory shows that strong electrostatic correlation causes the dipolar cation and anion to form alternating layers, which in turn yields substantial increases in the capacitance. Our results compare favorably with previous molecular dynamics simulations.

Electrocatalytic transformation of HF impurity to H-2 and LiF in lithium-ion batteries	NATURE CATALYSIS			English	Article							SOLID-ELECTROLYTE INTERPHASE; SURFACE-FILM FORMATION; GRAPHITE NEGATIVE ELECTRODE; HYDROGEN EVOLUTION; RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES; FUNDAMENTAL-ASPECTS; VINYLENE CARBONATE; EDGE PLANE; SEI; ANODES	The formation of solid electrolyte interphase on graphite anodes plays a key role in the efficiency of Li-ion batteries. However, to date, fundamental understanding of the formation of LiF as one of the main solid electrolyte interphase components in hexafluorophosphate-based electrolytes remains elusive. Here, we present experimental and theoretical evidence that LiF formation is an electrocatalytic process that is controlled by the electrochemical transformation of HF impurity to LiF and H-2. Although the kinetics of HF dissociation and the concomitant production of LiF and H-2 is dependent on the structure and nature of surface atoms, the underlying electrochemistry is the same. The morphology, and thus the role, of the LiF formed is strongly dependent on the nature of the substrate and HF inventory, leading to either complete or partial passivation of the interface. Our finding is of general importance and may lead to new opportunities for the improvement of existing, and design of new, Li-ion technologies.

Optimal Load-Tracking Operation of Grid-Connected Solid Oxide Fuel Cells through Set Point Scheduling and Combined L1-MPC Control	ENERGIES			English	Article						solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs); grid-connected fuel cell; power control; set point scheduling; L1 adaptive control; Model Predictive Control (MPC)	MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; DYNAMIC-MODEL; SYSTEMS; OPTIMIZATION; HYDROGEN	An optimal load-tracking operation strategy for a grid-connected tubular solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is studied based on the steady-state analysis of the system thermodynamics and electrochemistry. Control of the SOFC is achieved by a two-level hierarchical control system. In the upper level, optimal setpoints of output voltage and the current corresponding to unit load demand is obtained through a nonlinear optimization by minimizing the SOFC's internal power waste. In the lower level, a combined L1-MPC control strategy is designed to achieve fast set point tracking under system nonlinearities, while maintaining a constant fuel utilization factor. To prevent fuel starvation during the transient state resulting from the output power surging, a fuel flow constraint is imposed on the MPC with direct electron balance calculation. The proposed control schemes are testified on the grid-connected SOFC model.

DNA for Assembly and Charge Transport Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2	ADVANCED SUSTAINABLE SYSTEMS			English	Article						assembly; charge transport; CO2 reduction; DNA; Z-scheme	SHUTTLE REDOX MEDIATOR; VISIBLE-LIGHT IRRADIATION; Z-SCHEME SYSTEM; ELECTRON-TRANSFER; CARBON-DIOXIDE; ARTIFICIAL PHOTOSYNTHESIS; HYBRID PHOTOCATALYSTS; HYDROGEN EVOLUTION; WATER OXIDATION; HOLE-TRANSFER	This report demonstrates the use of DNA to spatially organize photoactive nanocrystals into well-defined Z-scheme architectures to facilitate CO2 reduction to usable fuels upon solar irradiation through electron transfer. Coupling donor (Titanium Oxide, TiO2) and acceptor (Cadmium Sulfide, CdS) nanocrystals with DNA yield a 5.25-fold improvement in CO2 reduction over simply mixing the photocatalysts in solution. In addition, it is demonstrated that electron transfer occurs over distances far greater than those achieved with polyethylene glycol spacer. Efficient Z-scheme photocatalytic reduction of CO2 is observed for DNA lengths of 10-80 bases, which separate the donor and acceptor nanocrystals by 3-24 nm. More significantly, an interparticle distance of 9-10 nm yields the highest conversion of CO2, which is found for nanocrystals spaced using either linear 30mer double strand DNA (dsDNA) or a 40mer DNA composed of both linear and hairpin DNA. When the amount of 30mer DNA linking the photocatalysts is lowered, a corresponding decrease in CO2 reduction yields is seen, showcasing the role of DNA in mediating electron transfer. These results demonstrate the highly unique attributes of DNA as both a templating agent for precise nanoscale assembly and for enabling charge transport. This work uncovers new research directions for nanoelectronics, electrochemistry, and photocatalysis.

Boundary asymptotics for a non-neutral electrochemistry model with small Debye length	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ANGEWANDTE MATHEMATIK UND PHYSIK			English	Article						Oxidation-reduction reaction; Non-neutral phenomenon; Steady-state PNP; Singularly perturbed elliptic problem; Boundary blow-up behavior	POISSON-BOLTZMANN EQUATION; SEMILINEAR ELLIPTIC PROBLEMS; NERNST-PLANCK; LAYERS	This article addresses the boundary asymptotics of the electrostatic potential in non-neutral electrochemistry models with small Debye length in bounded domains. Under standard physical assumptions motivated by non-electroneutral phenomena in oxidation-reduction reactions, we show that the electrostatic potential asymptotically blows up at boundary points with respect to the bulk reference potential as the scaled Debye length tends to zero. The analysis gives a lower bound for the blow-up rate with respect to the model parameters. Moreover, the maximum potential difference over any compact subset of the physical domain vanishes exponentially in the zero-Debye-length limit. The results mathematically confirm the physical description that electrolyte solutions are electrically neutral in the bulk and are strongly electrically non-neutral near charged surfaces.

In the present study, a nano-system was developed for simultaneous detection of HPV and HIV targeting E6-HPV16 and Gag-HIV genes respectively. The target sequences from the samples of the patients suffering from head and neck cancer were isolated by magnetic glass particles (MGPs) and subsequently were hybridized with a mixture of the complementary probes attached to cadmium telluride quantum dots (CdTe QDs). Finally, the specific and successful binding was determined by an easy fluorescence analyses and was corroborated by PCR and electrochemistry. Red and green CdTe QDs were used for the dual-color detection of HPV and HIV respectively. Our nano-system can be applied as a proficient tool for the identification of HPV, HIV or both diseases simultaneously, getting a successful and high sensitivity system of detection.

All metal complexes have square planar geometries and crystallize in the P2(1)/c space group. Structural characterization of the ligand shows contribution of the bis(ketone) tautomer in the crystalline phase, in agreement with density functional theory (DFF) computations. However, according to the UV-vis spectrum, there is a stronger influence of the bis(phenol) tautomer in solution. Cyclic experiments showed that the ligand undergoes a single irreversible oxidation process at 0.434 V (vs Fc/Fc(+)) while the complexes with Co2+, Ni2+ and Cu2+ suffer electroxidative process on the surface of the working electrode in addition to solution-assigned redox processes. The CoL oxidation is localized on the metal center, however, the CuL and NiL oxidations are considered as metal-ligand based processes. DFT calculations confirmed our experimental findings. The UV-vis spectra of the complexes illustrate ligand characteristic bands: in the case of the Cu2+ complex, the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) band is present at 385 nm, while in the case of Co2+ complex this same type of MLCT band appears at 377 nm.

Single-Nanoflake Photo-Electrochemistry Reveals Champion and Spectator Flakes in Exfoliated MoSe2 Films	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							SEMICONDUCTOR ELECTRODES; TUNGSTEN DISELENIDE; HYDROGEN EVOLUTION; WSE2; EFFICIENCY; N-MOSE2; N-WSE2; IODIDE; PHOTOELECTROCHEMISTRY; CONVERSION	Semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanoflake thin films are promising large-area electrodes for photo-electrochemical solar energy conversion applications. However, their energy conversion efficiencies are typically much lower than those of bulk electrodes. It is unclear to what extent this efficiency gap stems from differences among nanoflakes (e.g., area, thickness, and surface structural features). It is also unclear whether individual exfoliated nanoflakes can achieve energy conversion efficiencies similar to those of bulk crystals. Here, we use a single-nanoflake photo-electrochemical approach to show that there are both highly active and completely inactive nanoflakes within a film. For the exfoliated MoSe2 samples studied herein, 7% of nanoflakes are highly active champions, whose photocurrent efficiency exceeds that of the bulk crystal. However, 66% of nanoflakes are inactive spectators, which are mostly responsible for the overall lower photocurrent efficiency compared to the bulk crystal. The photocurrent collection efficiency increases with nanoflake area and decreases more at perimeter edges than at interior step edges. These observations, which are hidden in ensemble-level measurements, reveal the underlying performance issues of exfoliated TMD electrodes for photo-electrochemical energy conversion applications.

This bacterium secretes a unique, redox-active molecule known as pyocyanin that can serve as a useful biomarker for identification and detection of this opportunistic pathogen. This current study investigates the impact to pyocyanin production and ability to electrochemically distinguish pyocyanin when P. aeruginosa is co-cultured with other bacterial pathogens. To accomplish this, P. aeruginosa was co-cultured with up to four different clinically-relevant bacteria typically found in a wound infection. P. aeruginosa's production of pyocyanin was electrochemically monitored over a three day period and the results demonstrated that pyocyanin can be readily measured and that there were no observed enhancements or inhibitory effects to the production of pyocyanin. This information is valuable in the development of this sensing platform for clinical point-of-care diagnostics, where polymicrobial growth at the site of infection is common.

Collision and oxidation of single-Ag NPs are studied under higher positive potentials (>= 1 V versus Ag/AgCl electrode) on a gold UME than previously used. The use of higher potentials allows us to observe several unique features not seen at lower potentials (0.60.8 V), including a greatly increased collision frequency and the appearance of subcollision peaks with a long current tail. Moreover, the average charge transferred in a collision event is 3-5 times more than that estimated from a complete NP oxidation. Our results suggest that the enhanced charge transfer is due to coupled water oxidation catalyzed by Ag oxide transiently formed upon NP collision. A pH-dependence study was further performed to reveal a characteristic feature of water oxidation, and the formation of silver oxide was directly confirmed by single-NP fluorescence microscopy. This study offers a deeper insight into the collision electrochemistry of single-metal NPs and provides a new method for studying the electrocatalytic activity of silver oxide toward water oxidation on an electrode surface.

Precise modulation of neural activity may be achieved by controlled delivery of neurochemicals directly from coatings on MEA electrode sites. In this study, a novel dual-layer conductive polymer/acid functionalized carbon nanotube (fCNT) microelectrode coating is developed to better facilitate the loading and controlled delivery of the neurochemical 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX). The base layer coating is consisted of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene/fCNT and the top layer is consisted of polypyrrole/fCNT/DNQX. The dual-layer coating is capable of both loading and electrically releasing DNQX and the release dynamic is characterized with fluorescence microscopy and mathematical modeling. In vivo DNQX release is demonstrated in rat somatosensory cortex. Sensory-evoked neural activity is immediately (<1s) and locally (<446 mu m) suppressed by electrically triggered DNQX release. Furthermore, a single DNQX-loaded, dual-layer coating is capable of inducing effective neural inhibition for at least 26 times without observable degradation in efficacy. Incorporation of the novel drug releasing coating onto individual MEA electrodes offers many advantages over alternative methods by increasing spatial-temporal precision and improving drug selection flexibility without increasing the device's size.

Size-and composition-selected clusters can also serve as models of the catalytic active site, where an addition or removal of a single atom can have a dramatic effect on their activity and selectivity. In this perspective, we provide an overview of studies performed under both ultra-high vacuum and realistic reaction conditions aimed at the interrogation, characterization, and understanding of the performance of supported size-selected clusters in heterogeneous and electrochemical reactions, which address the effects of cluster size, cluster composition, cluster-support interactions, and reaction conditions, the key parameters for the understanding and control of catalyst functionality. Computational modeling based on density functional theory sampling of local minima and energy barriers or ab initio molecular dynamics simulations is an integral part of this research by providing fundamental understanding of the catalytic processes at the atomic level, as well as by predicting new materials compositions which can be validated in experiments. Finally, we discuss approaches which aim at the scale up of the production of well-defined clusters for use in real world applications. Published by AIP Publishing.

Dynamics of singlet fission and electron injection in self-assembled acene monolayers on titanium dioxide	CHEMICAL SCIENCE			English	Article							EXTERNAL QUANTUM EFFICIENCY; EXCITON-FISSION; CHARGE-TRANSFER; EXCEEDING 100-PERCENT; TETRACENE; PENTACENE; FLUORESCENCE; DERIVATIVES; STATES; MODEL	We employ a combination of linear spectroscopy, electrochemistry, and transient absorption spectroscopy to characterize the interplay between electron transfer and singlet fission dynamics in polyacene-based dyes attached to nanostructured TiO2. For triisopropyl silylethynyl (TIPS)-pentacene, we find that the singlet fission time constant increases to 6.5 ps on a nanostructured TiO2 surface relative to a thin film time constant of 150 fs, and that triplets do not dissociate after they are formed. In contrast, TIPS-tetracene singlets quickly dissociate in 2 ps at the molecule/TiO2 interface, and this dissociation outcompetes the relatively slow singlet fission process. The addition of an alumina layer slows down electron injection, allowing the formation of triplets from singlet fission in 40 ps. However, the triplets do not inject electrons, which is likely due to a lack of sufficient driving force for triplet dissociation. These results point to the critical balance required between efficient singlet fission and appropriate energetics for interfacial charge transfer.

Here, we present a new design of macroscale membraneless redox flow battery capable of recharging and recirculation of the same electrolyte streams for multiple cycles and maintains the advantages of the decoupled power and energy densities. The battery is based on immiscible aqueous anolyte and organic catholyte liquids, which exhibits high capacity retention and columbic efficiency during cycling. The aqueous anolyte consists of iron(II) sulfate (FeSO4) as active species, which is immiscible with the catholyte, having iron(III) acetylacetonate (Fe(acac)(3)) as active species dissolved in water-immiscible ethyl acetate, supported by ionic liquid (1-butyl-l-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide). Over 60% of initial discharge capacity was retained and over 80% of columbic efficiency was sustained after 25 cycles in a test flow cell, which is among the highest reported thus far.

Since boron has one electron less than carbon, the presence of boron on C-60 cages is expected to generate electron deficiency in C-60, and thereby to enhance its electron affinity. By using density functional theory (DFT), we studied the redox potentials and electronic properties of C-60 and C59B. We have found that doping C-60 with one boron atom results in a substantial increase in redox potential from 2.462V to 3.709V, which was attributed to the formation of an open shell system. We also investigated the redox and electronic properties of C59B functionalized with various redox-active oxygen containing functional groups (OCFGs). For the combination of functionalization with OCFGs and boron doping, it is found that the enhancement of redox potential is reduced, which is mainly attributed to the open shell structure being changed to a closed-shell one. Nevertheless, the redox potentials are still higher than that of pristine C-60. From the observation that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of closed-shell OCFG- functionalized C59B is correlated well with the redox potential, it was confirmed that the spin state is crucial to be considered to understand the relationship between electronic structure and redox properties.

Here we introduce a simple polyoxomolybdate, [(Mo4O8)-O-V(OH)(2)(H2O)(2)(C4O4)(2)](2-) (MoS), as reducing and stabilizing agent for the facile and one-pot syntheses of large quantity of highly stable MoS/rGO and MoS/Au NPs nanohybrids in aqueous solution without any catalyst or toxic co-solvent. They were characterized by various physical techniques and electrochemistry which confirm strong interaction between MoS and rGO sheets. We also used DFT calculations to investigate the affinity between MoS or its neutral form with graphene. The adsorption energy for the most stable configuration is -1.97 eV, indicating a strong adsorption process of MoS, which can also be confirmed by the distance (3.04 angstrom) and the charge transfer (0.86 e) between MoS and graphene. These observations are also consistent with the electrochemical results which underscore the excellent redox properties and high stability of MoS/rGO. Importantly, the MoS/rGO nanohybrids are excellent noble metal-free electrocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide reduction with high sensitivity, large detection range and low detection limit. Finally, the preliminary tests reveal that the electrode materials based on MoS/rGO and a low-cost carbon cloth (CC) composite MoS/rGO/CC may have a potential for an application in energy storage as performant and flexible supercapacitor, showing specific capacitance as high as 870 F g(-1) at 10 mV s(-1) and excellent stability after 5000 cycles.

Particularly, lithium-ion batteries show significant capacity loss at higher discharging rates (C-rates). In this work, we develop computational models incorporating coupled electrochemical mechanical thermal factors in order to reveal the relationship between the experimentally observed capacity loss and predicted mechanical stresses during electrochemical (dis)charging. Specifically, a multiphysics finite element model consisting of electrochemistry, heat generation, mass transport, and solid mechanics is developed to investigate thermal- and diffusion-induced stresses with the reconstructed porous microstructures of commercial LiFePO4 batteries. It has been suggested that porous microstructures in electrodes could mitigate the electrolyte reactivity for an improved battery life and safety. Therefore, the reconstructed porous microstructures from focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) images are adopted. The integrated experimental measurements and computational simulations show that: (1) Lithium-ion cells electrochemically tested at 3.6C have 30% capacity loss versus cells tested at 1.2C; a corresponding stress increase of 150% is observed from the multiphysic simulations. (2) The thermal models verified by in operando temperature measurement via the fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor demonstrate that increasing temperature results in larger thermal stresses during (dis)charging. However, increases in thermal stress due to higher temperature played a lesser role at higher C-rates. (3) Lithium-ion concentration distribution is location dependent; that is, at any time and at any given C-rate, the outer layer of the particle exhibits a higher concentration than that inside the particle. (4) Higher diffusiim-induced stresses are observed at the connecting areas between particles, suggesting that the higher stresses may result from higher concentration variations in the connecting area. This study presents results that include evolutions of lithium-ion concentration and mechanical stresses and could help to provide insight into the decreasing electrochemical performance of lithium-ion batteries at higher C-rates.

Here, a facile nondestructive multiscale assembly of multicomponent nanomaterials using self-assembled tyrosine-rich peptide nanofibers (TPFs) as a biological glue is reported. The versatile functionalities of the rationally devised tyrosine-rich short peptide allow for (1) self-assembly of the peptide into nanofibers using noncovalent interactions, followed by (2) immobilization of spatially distributed metal nanoparticles on the nanofiber surface, and (3) subsequent assembly with graphitic nanomaterials into a percolated network-structure. This percolated network-structure of silver nanoparticle (AgNP)-decorated peptide nanofibers with imbedded single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) proves to be a versatile nanoelectrode platform with excellent processability. The SWNT-TPF-AgNP assembly, when utilized as a flexible and transparent multicomponent electronic film, was quite effective for enhancing direct electron transfer (DET) as verified for a third-generation glucose sensor composed of this film. The simple solution process used to produce the functional nanomaterials could provide a new platform for scalable manufacturing of novel nanoelectrode materials forming effective electrical contacts with molecules from diverse biological systems.

However, materials showing this chemical reactivity are scarce. Suitable candidates require small particles to shorten transport lengths, together with chemically complex structures that promote cation mobility, such as spinel. These goals pose a challenge for materials chemists. Here, nanocrystals of spinel-type Mg0.5Mn2.5O4 were prepared using colloidal synthesis, and their electrochemical activity is presented. Cycling in an aqueous Mg2+ electrolyte led to a reversible transformation between a reduced spinel and an oxidized layered framework. This reaction involves large amounts of capacity because of the full oxidation to Mn4+, through the extraction of both Mg2+ and, in the first cycle, Mn2+ ions. Re-formation of the spinel upon reduction resulted in enrichment with Mg2+, indicating that its insertion is more favorable than that of Mn2+. Incorporation of water into the structure was not indispensable for the transformation, as revealed by experiments in non-aqueous electrolytes and infrared spectroscopy. The findings open the door for the use of similar nanocrystals in Mg batteries provided that electrolytes with suitable anodic stability are discovered, thereby identifying novel routes toward electrode materials for batteries with high energy.

Here we elucidate the interplay between intrinsic carrier transport, domain-boundary-induced conductivity, and PEC water oxidation in the model photoanode of bismuth vanadate (BiVO4). In particular, epitaxial single-domain BiVO4 and c-axis-oriented multidomain BiVO4 thin films are fabricated using pulsed laser deposition to decouple the intrinsic and extrinsic carrier transport. In addition to the low intrinsic conductivity that is due to the small-polaron transport within BiVO4 domains, we identify anomalously high electrical conductivity arising from vertical domain boundaries for multidomain BiVO4 films. Local domain-boundary conduction compensates the inherently poor electron transport by shortening the transport distance for electrons diffused into the domain-boundary region, therefore suppressing the photocurrent difference between front and back illumination. This work provides insights into engineering carrier transport through coordinating structural domain boundaries and intrinsic material features in designing modulated water-splitting photoelectrodes.

Herein, a series of chalcogenodiazolo [3,4-c]pyridine and alkyl substituted 3,4-propylenedioxythiophenes (ProDOTs) bearing D-A-type conjugated precursors were synthesized by Stille coupling, and electropolymerized to yield the corresponding polymers. The electrochemistry behavior and electrochromic properties of the polymers were comparatively investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and spectroelectrochemistry in detail. All the precursors revealed strong orange/purple/pink/bluish violet light emission with fluorescence quantum yields ranging from 0.09 to 0.60. Electrochromic results demonstrated that chalcogenodiazolo [3,4-c]pyricline-ProDOTs polymers revealed relatively good transmittance changes (311) of 38%, high coloration efficiency of 370 cm(2) C-1. in the near infrared (NIR) region and excellent switching stability (less than 4% after 2000 cycles). In comparison with polymers from chalcogenodiazolo [3,4-c]pyridine and thiophene, 3-alkylthiophene and EDOT, these polymers displayed higher coloration efficiency and better stability, resulting from the introduction of ProDOTs donor units. From these results, chalcogenodiazolo [3,4-c]pyridine-ProDOTs can be further explored as green and NIR electrochromic materials towards indoor electrochromic products and flexible displays.

Here, conjugated-polymer-based electrochromic devices (ECDs) that switch on-demand are demonstrated using transparent wood coated with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as a transparent conducting electrode. These ECDs exhibit a vibrant magenta-to-clear color change that results from a remarkably colorless bleached state. Furthermore, they require low energy and power inputs of 3 mWh m(-2) at 2 W m(-2) to switch due to a high coloration efficiency (590 cm(2)C(-1)) and low driving voltage (0.8 V). Each device component is processed with high-throughput methods, which highlights the opportunity to apply this approach to fabricate mechanically robust, energy-efficient smart windows on a large scale.

Of these candidates, ether-containing electrolytes have emerged as a promising material as a result of their electrochemical stability and utility in tuning the pertinent electrochemistry. The ability for ethers to chelate metal ions provides a unique feature to ion solvation structure; however its role in changing the association of ions in solution has not been fully explored. By using computational simulations validated by FTIR and NMR spectroscopy, detailed descriptions of the changes to solvation structure as a result of chelation and concentration were investigated for a series of ethers (monoglyme to tetraglyme). From these simulations it can clearly be seen that with increasing chelation, ion association is diminished in a nonlinear fashion. For a monoglyme solvent, sodiums are entirely coordinated by triflates in solution, even at low concentrations. In contrast, tetraglymes retain a significant solvent separation of sodium cations from high concentrations. The former implies that the utility of monoglyme and diglyme solvents for sodium-air batteries in specific is likely linked to their favoring ion association, while the poor performance of tetraglyme is a result of its excessive binding to sodium. Finally, triglyme was shown to produce anomalous behavior as a result of a mismatch between sodium coordination and steric interactions.

Photoelectrochemical Performance of BiVO4 Photoanodes Integrated with [NiFe]-Layered Double Hydroxide Nanocatalysts	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Artificial photosynthesis; Bismuth; Vanadium; Nanoparticles; Photocatalysis; Electrochemistry	BISMUTH VANADATE PHOTOANODES; WATER-OXIDATION; SURFACE MODIFICATION; CHARGE-TRANSPORT; PULSED-LASER; SOLAR FUELS; EFFICIENT; CATALYST; DISCOVERY	We immobilized laser-made nickel iron layered double hydroxide ([NiFe]-LDH) nanocatalysts on BiVO4 photoanodes. We compared photoelectrochemical performance of integrated [NiFe]-LDH-BiVO4 photoanodes in sulfite-free aqueous electrolyte with photocurrent generation of neat BiVO4 photoanodes in aqueous electrolyte with sulfite added as sacrificial hole acceptor. We optimized catalyst mass loading, which is a tradeoff between most efficient depletion of photogenerated holes that drive catalytic turnover and parasitic light absorption by the catalyst particles. We also mitigated nanocatalyst aggregation on the BiVO4 surface by a surfactant that selectively ligated the catalysts or by dispersing the catalyst suspension more rapidly on the photoanode surface. Our rational optimization strategies enhanced photoelectrochemical performance of integrated nanocatalyst photoanodes: Two thirds of all photogenerated holes escaped loss processes in our optimized integrated [NiFe]-LDH-BiVO4 photoanodes under 100 mWcm(-2) of simulated air mass 1.5 G illumination in aqueous pH 9.2 buffered electrolyte. Our systematic optimization strategies for integration of highly efficient water oxidation nanocatalysts with a visible-light absorber provide a path towards functional artificial photosynthesis devices.

Development and testing of a novel micro-Raman probe and application of calibration method for the quantitative analysis of microfluidic nitric acid streams	ANALYST			English	Article							PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES; 3 LICL-2 CSCL; EUROPIUM(III) CHLORIDE; MULTIVARIATE-ANALYSIS; WATER; SPECTROELECTROCHEMISTRY; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; SPECTROSCOPY; NACL; PERFORMANCE	To simplify and improve the safety of reprocessing used nuclear fuel, an initial assessment was made of Raman microscopy applied to microfluidic volumes with a view toward the on-line spectroscopic measurement of highly radioactive solutions. This study compares a microscopic Raman probe (excitation focal point diameter 70 mu m) to a larger, well studied probe (excitation focal point diameter 125 mu m) used in prior investigations. This was done by chemometrically modeling and predicting concentrations of HNO3 solutions (0 M to 8 M) as they flowed through microfluidic cells based upon spectra from each probe. Spectra recorded for each probe using the same static HNO3 solution set contained in 2 dram glass vials were used as training sets to produce models for the respective probes. Modeling required baseline, normalization and smoothing preprocessing to compensate for a reduced path length between the static glass vial training set (4 cm) and the reduced path length flow cell (1 cm), wide ranging solution concentrations, and the associated non-linear spectral changes, and abrupt and uneven concentration changes of flowing solutions. The micro-Raman probe is able to produce spectra that may be analyzed chemometrically to accurately predict the concentration of flowing HNO3 solutions down to microliter volumes. Based upon RMSECV and RMSEP modeling statistics concentration predictions of the microRaman probe are comparable to those obtained for a macro-Raman on identical samples.

The most studied complex electrolytes based on Lewis acid-base chemistry are expensive, difficult to be synthesized, and show limited anodic stability. Conventional electrolytes using simple salts such as Mg(TFSI)(2) can be readily synthesized, but Mg deposition/stripping in these simple salt electrolytes is accompanied by a large overpotential due to the formation of a surface layer on the Mg metal with a low Mg ion conductivity. Here the overpotential for Mg deposition/stripping in a simple salt, Mg(TFSI)(2)-1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME), electrolyte is significantly reduced by adding a small concentration of iodine (<= 50 x 10(-3) M) as an additive. Mechanism studies demonstrate that an Mg ion conductive solid MgI2 layer is formed on the surface of the Mg metal and acts as a solid electrolyte interface. With the Mg(TFSI)(2)-DME-I-2 electrolyte, a very small voltage hysteresis is achieved in an Mg-S full cell.

Here a high-performance sodium-selenium cell is presented by coupling a binder-free, self-interwoven carbon nanofiber-selenium cathode with a light-weight carbon-coated bifunctional separator. With this strategy, electrodes with a high Se mass loading (4.4 mg cm(-2)) render high reversible capacities of 599 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C rate and 382 mA h g(-1) at 5C rate. In addition, this novel cell offers good shelf-life with a low self-discharge, retaining 93.4% of its initial capacity even after resting for six months. As evidenced by experimental and density functional theory analysis, the remarkable dynamic (cycle life) and static (shelf-life) stabilities originate from the high electrical conductivity, improved Na-ion accessibility through the 3D interconnected open channels, and highly restrained polyselenide shuttle. The results demonstrate the viability of high-performance sodium-selenium batteries with high selenium loading.

Polyimide-polyurea copolymer coating with outstanding corrosion inhibition properties	JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE			English	Article						coatings; electrochemistry; structure-property relationships	ALUMINUM-ALLOY; CONVERSION COATINGS; B-POLYUREA; RESISTANCE; POLYANILINE; PROTECTION; MECHANISM; CHROMATE; 2024-T3; STEEL	A novel class of copolymers containing polyimide and polyurea blocks with unique physical properties and capable of providing effective protection to aluminum alloy 2024-T3 substrate against corrosion has been prepared. The structure and properties of polyurea-b-polyimide (PUI) copolymers were controlled by varying the co-monomer concentration. The PUI block copolymer can reorganize into a supra-molecular structure by forming intra-and inter-hydrogen bonding interactions between adjacent copolymer chains, resulting in a dense and compact structure capable of protecting the imide ring from hydrolysis when exposed to a corrosive environment. Apart from minimized surface hydrolysis, the establishment of compacted morphology also leads to a drastically improved barrier property and reduced diffusivity. The corrosion rate and polarization resistances of PUI-coated aluminum alloys were measured by using direct current polarization technique. Increasing polyurea concentration resulted in a remarkable decrease in diffussivity and surface energy, consistent with the measured remarkable increase in the coatings durability and corrosion performance. Corrosion inhibition tests were carried out for more than 30 weeks in a saturated NaCl solution containing 3.5 wt % of salt. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Investigation of alpha-MnO2 Tunneled Structures as Model Cation Hosts for Energy Storage	ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH			English	Review							SILVER HOLLANDITE; LITHIUM BATTERIES; CATHODE MATERIALS; ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; CATALYTIC-ACTIVITY; MANGANESE-DIOXIDE; NANORODS; OXIDATION; INSERTION; IMPACT	CONSPECTUS: Future advances in energy storage systems rely on identification of appropriate target materials and deliberate synthesis of the target materials with control of their physiochemical properties in order to disentangle the contributions of distinct properties to the functional electrochemistry. This goal demands systematic inquiry using model materials that provide the opportunity for significant synthetic versatility and control. Ideally, a material family that enables direct manipulation of characteristics including composition, defects, and crystallite size while remaining within the defined structural framework would be necessary. Accomplishing this through direct synthetic methods is desirable to minimize the complicating effects of secondary processing. The structural motif most frequently used for insertion type electrodes is based on layered type structures where ion diffusion in two dimensions can be envisioned. However, lattice expansion and contraction associated with the ion movement and electron transfer as a result of repeated charge and discharge cycling can result in structural degradation and amorphization with accompanying loss of capacity. In contrast, tunnel type structures embody a more rigid framework where the inherent structural design can accommodate the presence of cations and often multiple cations. Of specific interest are manganese oxides as they can exhibit a tunneled structure, termed alpha-MnO2, and are an important class of nanomaterial in the fields of catalysis, adsorption separation, and ion-exchange. The alpha-MnO2, structure has one-dimensional 2 x 2 tunnels formed by corner and edge sharing manganese octahedral [MnO6] units and can be readily substituted in the central tunnel by a variety of cations of varying size. Importantly, alpha-MnO2 materials possess a rich chemistry with significant synthetic versatility allowing deliberate synthetic control of structure, composition, crystallite size, and defect content. This Account considers the investigation of alpha-MnO2, tunnel type structures and their electrochemistry. Examination of the reported findings on this material family demonstrates that multiple physiochemical properties influence the electrochemistry. The retention of the parent structure during charge and discharge cycling, the material composition including the identity and content of the central cation, the surface condition including oxygen vacancies, and crystallite size have all been demonstrated to impact electrochemical function. The selection of the alpha-MnO2 family of materials as a model system and the ability to control the variables associated with the structural family affirm that full investigation of the mechanisms related to active materials in an electrochemical system demands concerted efforts in synthetic material property control and multimodal characterization, combined with theory and modeling. This then enables more complete understanding of the factors that must be controlled to achieve consistent and desirable outcomes.

Hydrogen Evolution at the Buried Interface between Pt Thin Films and Silicon Oxide Nanomembranes	ACS CATALYSIS			English	Article						electrocatalysis; membrane-coated electrocatalyst; membrane; silicon dioxide; platinum; mass transport; catalyst poisoning	HIGHLY STABLE ELECTROCATALYSTS; ELECTROLYTE FUEL-CELLS; PLATINUM NANOPARTICLES; CATHODE CATALYSTS; LAYER DEPOSITION; PORE-SIZE; TRANSPORT; OXIDATION; SURFACE; ELECTROCHEMISTRY	This paper reports the performance of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts based on Pt thin film electrodes that are encapsulated by silicon oxide (SiOx) nanomembranes. This membrane-coated electrocatalyst (MCEC) architecture offers a promising approach to enhancing electrocatalyst stability while incorporating advanced catalytic functionalities such as poison resistance and tunable reaction selectivity. Herein, a room temperature ultraviolet (UV) ozone synthesis process was used to systematically control the thickness of SiOx overlayers with nanoscale precision and evaluate their influence on the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and HER performance of the underlying Pt thin films. Through detailed characterization of the physical and electrochemical properties of the SiOx-encapsulated electrodes, it is shown that proton and H-2 transport occur primarily through the SiOx coating such that the HER takes place at the buried Pt vertical bar SiOx interface. Increasing the thickness of the SiOx overlayers results in monotonic increases in the overpotential losses of the MCEC electrodes. These overpotential losses were fit using a one-dimensional diffusion model, from which the H+ and H-2 permeabilities through SiOx were obtained. Importantly, the SiOx nanomembranes were found to exhibit high selectivity for proton and H2 transport in comparison to Cu2+, a model HER poison. Leveraging this property, we show that SiOx encapsulation can enable copper resistant operation of Pt HER electrocatalysts. It is expected that a more complete understanding of the structure property performance relationships of the SiOx overlayers will enable the design of stable MCECs capable of multifunctional catalysis with minimal loss in efficiency from concentration overpotential losses associated with mass transport through SiOx. .

Performances of Ir-Ni and Ir-Co nanowires for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) have been measured in rotating disk electrode half-cells and single-cell electrolyzers and compared with commercial baselines and literature references. The nanowire catalysts showed improved mass activity, by more than an order of magnitude compared with commercial Ir nanoparticles in half-cell tests. The nanowire catalysts also showed greatly improved durability, when acid leached to remove excess Ni and Co. Both Ni and Co templates were found to have similarly positive impacts, although specific differences between the two systems are revealed. In single-cell electrolysis testing, nanowires exceeded the performance of Ir nanoparticles by 4-5 times, suggesting that significant reductions in catalyst loading are possible without compromising performance.

To target these issues, a double-coating synthetic route has been developed to prepare a yolk-shell-structured gamma-Fe2O3/nitrogen-doped carbon composite, in which spindle-like gamma-Fe2O3 cores are encapsulated in the highly conductive carbon shell. Through precisely controlling the void space between the gamma-Fe2O3 core and the carbon shell, volume variation in gamma-Fe2O3 during (de)lithiation is well accommodated, while the composite maintains an intact and relatively dense structure, which stabilizes the solid-electrolyte interface and is beneficial for improving the practical energy density of the material. With a stabilized (de)lithiation electrochemistry and a synergistic storage effect between the two active components, the composite enables excellent lithium storage performance, in terms of reversible capacity, cycling ability, and rate capability.

Raman spectrometry confirmed that CPTPP chemical structure was preserved in MAPLE-deposited thin films at 200 mJ/cm(2) laser fluence. Atomic force microscopy topography revealed that MAPLE-deposited thin films have a better coverage on the working electrode made of carbon compared to the ones obtained by dropcasting. Cyclic voltammetry demonstrated that CPTPP is an appropriate mediator for histamine detection in trichloroacetic acid solution. We proved that MAPLE serves as a soft technique in fabrication of porphyrin thin films and patterns. (C) 2017 Academie des sciences. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

The cell is comprised of a bipolar electrode fabricated using photolithography that spans sensing and reporting compartments constructed using a 3D printer. The square-wave technique allows an electroactive analyte to be regenerated by applying a reverse potential, thus allowing significant S/N gains by accumulating ECL signals over multiple measure-regenerate cycles. The working principles of the SW-BPE sensor were demonstrated using Fe(CN)(6)(3-) as a representative analyte. Using DNA self-assembled monolayers as a model for the electrochemical proximity assay co-developed in our laboratories, we demonstrate the ability to detect ca. 300 fmol/cm(2) of MB-conjugated DNA. The square wave ECL sensor described herein is capable of detecting a wide variety of analytes over broad concentration ranges, and shows great promise for a variety of analytical applications.

On the mechanism of the electrochemical conversion of ammonia to dinitrogen on Pt(100) in alkaline environment	JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS			English	Article						Single-crystal electrochemistry; Electrocatalysis; Physical electrochemistry; Nitrogen cycle; Ammonia oxidation	OXYGEN REDUCTION; ELECTROCATALYTIC OXIDATION; SURFACE CHARACTERIZATION; PLATINUM NANOPARTICLES; INFRARED-SPECTROSCOPY; HYDROGEN-PRODUCTION; CYCLIC VOLTAMMETRY; ANODIC-OXIDATION; NITRIC-OXIDE; FUEL-CELL	The electrochemical oxidation of ammonia to dinitrogen is a model reaction for the electrocatalysis of the nitrogen cycle, as it can contribute to the understanding of the making/breaking of N-N, N-O, or N-H bonds. Moreover, it can be used as the anode reaction in ammonia electrolyzers for H-2 production or in ammonia fuel cells. We study here the reaction on the N-2-forming Pt(1 0 0) electrode using a combination of electrochemical methods, product characterization and computational methods, and suggest a mechanism that is compatible with the experimental and theoretical findings. We propose that N-2 is formed via an *NH + *NH coupling step, in accordance with the Gerischer-Mauerer mechanism. Other N-N bond forming steps are considered less likely based on either their unfavourable energetics or the low coverage of the necessary monomers. The N N coupling is inhibited by strongly adsorbed *N and *NO species, which are formed by further oxidation of *NH. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

It is found that doping C-60 with one nitrogen atom results in a slight increase in redox potential. Next, we have also studied C59N functionalized with various redox-active oxygen containing functional groups and strongly electron withdrawing functional groups. It is found that the intrinsic electronic structure of the molecule is the major determinant of the redox potential. Our DFT calculations show that the electron affinity to redox potential of functionalized C59N is correlated with the LUMO of the systems very well. This is the first systematic study on the redox properties and electronic structures of N-doped C-60 systems.

It has promising applications in the fields of catalysis, bio/chemical sensing, drug delivery, biomolecules separation and purification, fuel cell development, surface-chemistry-driven actuation, and supercapacitor design. Many chemical and electrochemical procedures are known for the preparation of np-Au. Recently, researchers are focusing on easier and controlled ways to tune the pores and ligaments size of np-Au for its use in different applications. Electrochemical methods have good control over fine-tuning pore and ligament sizes. The np-Au electrodes that are prepared using electrochemical techniques are robust and are easier to handle for their use in electrochemical biosensing. Here, we review different electrochemical strategies for the preparation, post-modification, and characterization of np-Au along with the synergistic use of both electrochemistry and np-Au for applications in biosensing.

Among these TMD materials, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has shown promising applications in electronics, photonics, energy, and electrochemistry. In particular, the defects in MoS2 play an essential role in altering the electronic, magnetic, optical, and catalytic properties of MoS2, presenting a useful way to engineer the performance of MoS2. The mechanisms by which lattice defects affect the MoS2 properties are unsettled. In this work, we reveal systematically how lattice defects and substrate interface affect MoS2 electronic structure. We fabricated single-layer MoS2 by chemical vapor deposition and then transferred onto Au, single-layer graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and CeO2 as substrates and created defects in MoS2 by ion irradiation. We assessed how these defects and substrates affect the electronic structure of MoS2 by performing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopies, and scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy measurements. Molecular dynamics and first-principles based simulations allowed us to conclude the predominant lattice defects upon ion irradiation and associate those with the experimentally obtained electronic structure. We found that the substrates can tune the electronic energy levels in MoS2 due to charge transfer at the interface. Furthermore, the reduction state of CeO2 as an oxide substrate affects the interface charge transfer with MoS2. The irradiated MoS2 had a faster hydrogen evolution kinetics compared to the as-prepared MoS2, demonstrating the concept of defect controlled reactivity in this phase. Our findings provide effective probes for energy band and defects in MoS2 and show the importance of defect engineering in tuning the functionalities of MoS2 and other TMDs in electronics, optoelectronics, and electrochemistry.

Nanopore Opening at Flat and Nanotip Conical Electrodes during Vesicle Impact Electrochemical Cytometry	ACS NANO			English	Article						simulation; disk electrode; nanotip electrode; catecholamine; nanometer vesicles; electrochemistry; collection efficiency	INCREASES QUANTAL SIZE; CHROMAFFIN CELLS; VESICULAR EXOCYTOSIS; SECRETORY VESICLES; SINGLE CELLS; RELEASE; EVENTS; TRANSMITTERS; KINETICS; FUSION	The oxidation of catecholamine at a micro electrode, following its release from individual vesicles, allows interrogation of the content of single nanometer vesicles with vesicle impact electrochemical cytometry (VIEC). Previous to this development, there were no methods available to quantify the chemical load of single vesicles. However, accurate quantification of the content is hampered by uncertainty in the proportion of substituent molecules reaching the electrode surface (collection efficiency). In this work, we use quantitative modeling to calculate this collection efficiency. For all vesicles except those at the very edge of the electrode, modeling shows that similar to 100% oxidation efficiency is achieved when employing a 33 pm diameter disk microelectrode for VIEC, independent of the location of the vesicle release pore. We use this to experimentally determine a precise distribution of catecholamine in individual vesicles extracted from PC12 cells. In contrast, we calculate that when a nanotip conical electrode (similar to 4 mu m length, similar to 1.5 mu m diameter at the base) is employed, as in intracellular VIEC (IVIEC), the current-time response depends strongly on the position of the catecholamine-releasing pore in the vesicle membrane. When vesicle release occurs with the pore opening occurring far from the electrode, lower currents and partial oxidation (similar to 75%) of the catecholamine are predicted, as compared to higher currents and 100% oxidation, when the pore is close to/at the electrode surface. As close agreement is observed between the experimentally measured vesicular content in intracellular and extracted vesicles from the same cell line using nanotip and disk electrodes, respectively, we conclude that pores open at the electrode surface. Not only does this suggest that electroporation of the vesicle membrane is the primary driving force for catecholamine release from vesicles at polarized electrodes, but it also indicates that IVIEC with nanotip electrodes can directly assess vesicular content without correction.

Electrochemical Investigation of the Kinetics of Chloride Substitution upon Reduction of [Ru(porphyrin)(NO)Cl] Complexes in Tetrahydrofuran	CHEMELECTROCHEM			English	Article						Kinetics; Nitrogen oxides; Nitrosyl; Porphyrinoids; Ruthenium	INFRARED REFLECTANCE SPECTROELECTROCHEMISTRY; RUTHENIUM NITROSYL PORPHYRINS; (POR)RU(NO)CL COMPOUNDS POR; NITRIC-OXIDE; SWEEP VOLTAMMETRY; REDOX PROPERTIES; HYDRIDE ATTACK; ZONE DIAGRAM; METAL; IRON	The electrochemistry of several ruthenium porphyrin nitrosyl chloride complexes [Ru(por)(NO)Cl] have been examined in tetrahydrofuran (THF). The complexes undergo one-electron irreversible reductions, which result in diffusion-limited substitutions of the chloride ligands for THF. This chloride metathesis is reversible in the presence of added NBu4Cl, and equilibrium constants and rate constants for chloride loss have been estimated. These parameters correlate with the NO stretching frequencies of the parent complexes, with more electron-donating porphyrin ligands favoring chloride loss from the reduced complexes. The [Ru(por)(NO)(THF)] products of the reductions can be detected by IR, EPR, and visible spectroscopies. These species undergo three further reductions, with good reversibility at scan rates >0.40Vs(-1). The [Ru(por) (NO)(THF)](+/0) couples have also been determined, and the rate constants and equilibrium constants for recombination with chloride have been estimated. One-electron reductions of the [Ru(por)(NO)Cl] complexes result in approximately 10(18) enhancement of the rates of chloride loss.

However, schematic diagrams, which are often used in many publications, lack quantified changes in potential across junction interfaces. This is especially true as the energetics become increasingly unintuitive when incorporating the effects of dielectric layers and applying ferroelectric and piezoelectric charges, such as the case of piezotronics. In the paper, a quantitative band diagram computation of a series of complex heterojunctions often seen in piezotronic systems is provided. The computation is conducted by using fundamental semiconductor and electrochemical equations, idealizing metals, insulators, and ferroelectrics, and treating ferro- and piezoelectric dipoles as surface charges at their respective interfaces. A Mathematica code is used to produce potential profiles and energy band diagrams of sections of semiconductor-based electrochemical electrodes. It is illustrated that the ferro- and piezoelectric properties have a profound effect on solid-solid heterojunctions and solid-electrolyte interfaces, offering a guideline for piezotronic system design and development.

Silver ferrite/maghemite composites and mixtures: Impact of one-pot composite preparation on battery-relevant electrochemistry	APPLIED MATERIALS TODAY			English	Article						Silver ferrite; Delafossite; Lithium battery; Composite; Onepot synthesis	IRON-OXIDE NANOPARTICLES; LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES; LI-ION; MAGHEMITE; FERRITE; ANODE; INTERCALATION; SPECTROSCOPY; ELECTRODES; IMPEDANCE	A series of silver ferrite/maghemite composite materials (AgxFeOy, where AgxFeOy = composites of xAgFeO(2) + [(1 - x)/2] gamma-Fe2O3 and y = 2 - (1 - x)/2) have been prepared via a non-stoichiometric, one-pot co-precipitation strategy. The impact of a one-pot composite preparation on electrochemistry was determined by comparison to a mechanical mixture of nanocrystalline AgFeO2 and gamma-Fe2O3 powders, which were combined to afford an overall composition of Ag0.2FeO1.6. Notably, following 30 discharge-charge cycles, the one-pot Ag0.2FeO1.6 composite delivers an energy density (156 mWh/g) profoundly higher than the mechanical mixture Ag0.2FeO1.6(67 mWh/g). AgxFeOy composites with the lowest Ag (x) content and smallest crystallite size, Ag0.2FeO1.6, deliver twice the discharge energy density (169 mWh/g) of stoichiometric AgFeO2 with no maghemite component and exhibited good capacity retention over 50 cycles. The notable electrochemistry of one-pot AgxFeOy composites may involve reduced AgFeO2 and gamma-Fe2O3 aggregate sizes and a concomitant increase in AgFeO2/gamma-Fe2O3 crystallite contact not achievable through mechanical mixing.

The reference electrode potential is determined by the concentrations of Ag+ and S2-, which are established by the solubility of the Ag2S coating on the Ag wire. While potential shifts of > 100 mV during an experiment have been reported when using silver or platinum wire quasi-reference electrodes, the reference electrode reported here provides a stable potential over several months of experimental use. Additionally, our reference electrode can be prepared and used in a normal air atmosphere, and does not need to be assembled and used in a glovebox, or protected from light. The reference electrode has been characterized by voltammetry measurements of ferrocene and cobaltocenium hexafluorophosphate, and was found to slowly drift to more positive potentials at a rate of < 1 mV/day for five of the six ionic liquids investigated.

All major automotive companies are having well-funded plans for mass market affordable branded EV product line models, which can open the floodgates. A rapid growth of battery energy density, accompanied by an aggressive progress of reduction of costs of lithium-Ion batteries, brings safety concerns. While more energy stored in the battery pack of an EV translates to a longer range, the downside is that accidents will be more violent due to battery inevitable explosion. With today's technology, severe crashes involving intrusion into the battery pack will potentially result in a thermal runaway, fire, and explosion. Most of research on lithium-ion batteries have been concerned with the electrochemistry of cells. However, in most cases failure and thermal runaway is caused by mechanical loading due to crash events. There is a growing need to summarize the already published results on mechanical loading and response of batteries and offer a critical evaluation of work in progress. The objective of this paper is to present such review with a discussion of many outstanding issues and outline of a roadmap for future research.

Artificial Metalloproteins Containing Co4O4 Cubane Active Sites	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							OXYGEN-EVOLVING CATALYST; WATER OXIDATION CATALYSTS; EVOLUTION REACTION; PHOTOSYSTEM-II; TERMINAL OXO; NEUTRAL PH; COBALT; INTERMEDIATE; CO(IV); MECHANISM	Artificial metalloproteins (ArMs) containing Co4O4 cubane active sites were constructed via biotin-streptavidin technology. Stabilized by hydrogen bonds (H-bonds), terminal and cofacial Co-III-OH2 moieties are observed crystallographically in a series of immobilized cubane sites. Solution electrochemistry provided correlations of oxidation potential and pH. For variants containing Ser and Phe adjacent to the metallocofactor, 1e(-)/1H(+) chemistry predominates until pH 8, above which the oxidation becomes pH-independent. Installation of Tyr proximal to the Co4O4 active site provided a single H-bond to one of a set of cofacial Co-III-OH2 groups. With this variant, multi-e(-)/multi-H+ chemistry is observed, along with a change in mechanism at pH 9.5 that is consistent with Tyr deprotonation. With structural similarities to both the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II (H-bonded Tyr) and to thin film water oxidation catalysts (Co4O4 core), these findings bridge synthetic and biological systems for water oxidation, highlighting the importance of secondary sphere interactions in mediating multi-e(-)/multi-H+ reactivity.

Owing to the high overall conductivity, large electrochemical surface area and abundant active sites, this novel electrode exhibits an excellent performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Remarkably, the composite electrode shows a low Tafel slope of 41.7 mV/dec, and an ultrahigh cathodic current density of 550 mA/cm(2) at a very low overpotential of 0.25 V. This work presents a new universal strategy for the construction of effective, durable, scalable, and inexpensive electrodes that can be extended to other electrocatalytic systems.

Ercan; Hu, Michael; Zhao, Jiyong; Lehnert, Nicolai			The Semireduced Mechanism for Nitric Oxide Reduction by Non-Heme Diiron Complexes: Modeling Flavodiiron Nitric Oxide Reductases	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							IRON-OXO PROTEINS; RIBONUCLEOTIDE REDUCTASE; THEORETICAL DESCRIPTION; METHANE MONOOXYGENASE; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; O-2 ACTIVATION; NO; REACTIVITY; OXYGEN; INSIGHTS	Flavodiiron nitric oxide reductases (FNORs) are a subclass of flavodiiron proteins (FDPs) capable of preferential binding and subsequent reduction of NO to N2O. FNORs are found in certain pathogenic bacteria, equipping them with resistance to nitrosative stress, generated as a part of the immune defense in humans, and allowing them to proliferate. Here, we report the spectroscopic characterization and detailed reactivity studies of the diiron dinitrosyl model complex [Fe-2(BPMP)(OPr)(NO)(2)](OTf)(2) for the FNOR active site that is capable of reducing NO to N2O [Zheng et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2013, 135, 4902-4905]. Using UV vis spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and spectro-electrochemistry, we show that one reductive equivalent is in fact sufficient for the quantitative generation of N2O, following a semi-reduced reaction mechanism. This reaction is very efficient and produces N2O with a first-order rate constant k > 10(2) s(-1) Further isotope labeling studies confirm an intramolecular N-N coupling mechanism, consistent with the rapid time scale of the reduction and a very low barrier for N-N bond formation. Accordingly, the reaction proceeds at 80 degrees C, allowing for the direct observation of the mixed-valent product of the reaction. At higher temperatures, the initial reaction product is unstable and decays, ultimately generating the diferrous complex [Fe-2(BPMP)(OPr)(2)](OTf) and an unidentified ferric product. These results combined offer deep insight into the mechanism of NO reduction by the relevant model complex [Fe-2(BPMP)(OPr)(NO)(2)](2+) and provide direct evidence that the semireduced mechanism would constitute a highly efficient pathway to accomplish NO reduction to N2O in FNORs and in synthetic catalysts.

SEC possesses interdisciplinary advantages and can further expand the scopes in the fields of analysis and other applications, emphasizing the hot issues of analytical chemistry, materials science, biophysics, chemical biology, and so on. Considering the past and future development of SEC, a review on the recent progress of SEC is presented and selected examples involving surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis), near-infrared (NIR), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), fluorescence, as well as other SEC are summarized to fully demonstrate these techniques. In addition, the optically transparent electrodes and SEC cell design, and the typical applications of SEC in mechanism study, electrochromic device fabrication, sensing and protein study are fully introduced. Finally, the key issues, future perspectives and trends in the development of SEC are also discussed.

Measurements that probe oxide-electrolyte interfaces in situ provide important details of ion and solvent arrangements, but atomically precise structural models do not exist for common oxide-electrolyte interfaces far from equilibrium. Using a novel cell, the structure of the hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) (1 (1) over bar 02)-electrolyte interface is measured under controlled electrochemical bias using synchrotron crystal truncation rod X-ray scattering. At increasingly cathodic potentials, charge-compensating protonation of surface oxygen groups increases the coverage of specifically bound water while adjacent water layers displace outwardly and became disordered. Returning to open circuit potential leaves the surface in a persistent metastable state. Therefore, the flux of current and ions across the interface is regulated by multiple electrolyte layers whose specific structure and polarization change in response to the applied potential. The study reveals the complex environment underlying the simplified electrical double layer models used to interpret electrochemical measurements and emphasizes the importance of condition-specific structural characterization for properly understanding catalytic processes at functional transition metal oxide-electrolyte interfaces.

Multivariate Analysis To Quantify Species in the Presence of Direct Interferents: Micro-Raman Analysis of HNO3 in Microfluidic Devices	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							3 LICL-2 CSCL; EUROPIUM(III) CHLORIDE; SPECTROSCOPY; SPECTROELECTROCHEMISTRY; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; EUTECTICS; RBCL; NACL; KCL	Microfluidic devices are a growing field with significant potential for applications to small scale processing of solutions. Much like large scale processing, fast, reliable, and cost-effective means of monitoring streams during processing are needed. Here we apply a novel micro-Raman probe to the online monitoring of streams within a microfluidic device. For either macro- or microscale process monitoring via spectroscopic response, interfering or confounded bands can obfuscate results. By utilizing chemometric analysis, a form of multivariate analysis, species can be accurately quantified in solution despite the presence of overlapping or confounding spectroscopic bands. This is demonstrated on solutions of HNO3 and NaNO3 within microflow and microfluidic devices.

Complete synthesis, structural characterization, and electrochemistry, in addition to static and dynamic photophysical properties of [Cu(sbmpep)(2)](+), are reported on all relevant time scales. UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy revealed significant increases in oscillator strength along with a concomitant bathochromic shift in the MLCT absorption bands with respect to structurally related model complexes (epsilon = 16 500 M-1 cm(-1) at 491 nm). Strong red photoluminescence Phi = 2.7%, lambda(max) = 687 nm) was observed from [Cu(sbmpep)(2)](+), which featured an average excited-state lifetime of 1.4 ps in deaerated dichloromethane. Cyclic and differential pulse voltammetry revealed similar to 300 mV positive shifts in the measured one-electron reversible reduction and oxidation waves in relation to a Cu(I) model complex possessing identical structural elements without the pi-conjugated 4,7-substituents. The excited-state redox potential of [Cu(sbmpep)(2)](+) was estimated to be -1.36 V, a notably powerful reductant for driving photoredox chemistry. The combination of conventional and ultrafast transient absorption and luminescence spectroscopy successfully map the excited-state dynamics of [Cu(sbmpep)(2)](+) from initial photoexcitation to the formation of the lowestenergy MLCT excited state and ultimately its relaxation to the ground state. This newly conceived molecule appears poised for photosensitization reactions involving energy and electron-transfer processes relevant to photochemical upconversion, photoredox catalysis, and solar fuels photochemistry.

Despite many efforts made to understand the fundamental Li-O-2 electrochemistry, the kinetic process of cathodic reactions, associated with the formation and decomposition of a solid Li2O2 phase during charging and discharging, remains debate. Here we report direct visualization of the charge/discharge reactions on a gold cathode in a non-aqueous lithium-oxygen micro-battery using liquid-cell aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) combining with synchronized electrochemical measurements. The real-time and real-space characterization by time-resolved STEM reveals the electrochemical correspondence of discharge/charge overpotentials to the nucleation, growth and decomposition of Li2O2 at a constant current density. The nano-scale operando observations would enrich our knowledge on the underlying reaction mechanisms of lithium-oxygen batteries during round-trip discharging and charging and shed lights on the strategies in improving the performances of lithium-oxygen batteries by tailoring the cathodic reactions.

High capacity lithium ion batteries composed of cobalt oxide nanoparticle anodes and Raman spectroscopic analysis of nanoparticle strain dynamics in batteries	NANOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						nanoparticles; lithium ion battery; Raman spectroscopy; electrophoretic deposition	ELECTROPHORETIC DEPOSITION; THIN-FILMS; ELECTRODE MATERIALS; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; BINDER-FREE; GRAPHENE; CARBON; NANOCRYSTALS; CU2-XS	Cobalt nanoparticle thin films were electrophoretically deposited on copper current collectors and were annealed into thin films of hollow Co3O4 nanoparticles. These thin films were directly used as the anodes of lithium ion batteries (LIBs) without the addition of conducting carbons and bonding agents. LIBs thus fabricated show high gravimetric capacities and long cycle lives. For approximate to 1.0 mu m thick Co3O4 nanoparticle films the gravimetric capacities of the batteries were more than 800 mAh g(-1) at a current rate of C/15, which is about 90% of the theoretical maximum. Additionally, the batteries were able to undergo 200 charge/discharge cycles at a relatively fast rate of C/5 and maintain 50% of the initial capacity. In order to understand the electrochemistry of lithiation in the context of nanoparticles, Raman spectra were collected at different stages of the electrode cycles to determine the chemical and structural changes in the nanomaterials. Our results indicate that initially the electrode nanoparticles were under significant strain and as the battery underwent many cycles of charging/discharging the nanoparticles experienced progressive strain relaxation.

This MAPbI(3)/rGO composite is shown to be an outstanding visible-light photocatalyst for H-2 evolution in aqueous HI solution saturated with MAPbI(3). Powder samples of MAPbI(3)/rGO (100 mg) show a H-2 evolution rate of 93.9 mu mol h(-1), which is 67 times faster than that of pristine MAPbI(3), under 120 mW cm(-2) visible-light (lambda >= 420 nm) illumination, and the composite is highly stable showing no significant decrease in the catalytic activity after 200 h (i.e., 20 cycles) of repeated H-2 evolution experiments. The electrochemiluminescence performance of MAPbI(3) is investigated to explore the charge transfer process, to find that the photogenerated electrons in MAPbI(3) are transferred to the rGO sites, where protons are reduced to H-2.
