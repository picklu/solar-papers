Biomolecular photosensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells: Recent developments and critical insights	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS			English	Review						Biomolecular dyes; DSSCs; Sensitizers; Solar energy; Protein; Bacteria; Carotenoid	FREE COUNTER ELECTRODES; NANOCRYSTALLINE TIO2 FILMS; STRUCTURE-PROPERTY RELATIONSHIPS; PHOTOSYNTHETIC REACTION CENTERS; POWER CONVERSION EFFICIENCY; EXCITED-STATE PROPERTIES; OPEN-CIRCUIT VOLTAGE; THIN-FILM; LOW-COST; RECOMBINATION DYNAMICS	Dye-sensitized solar cells based on bacterial-based photosensitizers (bio-sensitized DSSCs) are promising bio-photoelectronic molecular devices exhibiting enhanced electron excitation, injection, and dye regeneration for efficient photon-to-electron quantum-conversion. Achieving high DSSCs performance via environmentally sustainable, cost-effective, and naturally-sensitized plant-based or bacterial-based biomolecules remains a challenge. Here, we provide a comprehensive study on the mechanisms involved in the utilization of biomolecular bacterial-based pigments (e.g. proteins and carotenoids) for an improved bio-sensitized DSSCs performance. Protein complexes and chlorophyll a/carotenoids are among many bio-photosensitizers demonstrating high incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE). Pigments molecular structure, donor-pi-acceptor conjugation, and anchoring groups have been discussed and attributed to theoretical dye HOMO-LUMO bandgaps and their corresponding bio-sensitized DSSCs IPCE. This review provides critical understanding of advancements towards natural photosensitization: (i) carboxyl/hydroxyl groups attached to acceptor segments provide firm attachment and rapid electron injection, (ii) proteins/carotenoids hybrid dyes induce visible-light photosensitivity and broaden absorbance, (iii) increased conjugated pi-bonds (n > 13) develop pigment visible-NIR absorption with intensified photoactivity, (iv) chromatophores integrated with bio-electrolyte provide a unidirectional flow of electrons, (v) reaction center (RC)-sensitized DSSCs have better optoelectronic properties than light-harvesting complex (LH2) due to its efficient charge separation, (vi) antioxidants hinder degradation of pigmented-photoanodes from UV radiation, (vii) solid-state redox improves device stability and dye neutralization; which all together would boost the dye sensitization performance in bio-sensitized DSSCs. The highest recorded IPCEs are found for TiO2-based DSSCs using plant-based coumarin (9%) and from [A. amentacea + P. pterocarpum] pigments (8.22%). Futuristically, we anticipate that these biologically-derived photosensitizers can be integrated into photoanodes for photoelectronic applications including DSSCs, multi junction cells, photodiodes, phototransistors, photodetectors, flexible bioelectronic films and clothes, bio-LEDs, and photo-tunneling junctions.

For the simulation of the realistic environment, some important parameters, including energy levels, energy gaps, electron density, projected density of states (PDOS), absorption, vertical dipole moment, first hyperpolarizability, light-harvesting efficiency (LHE), evaluation on electron injection, are calculated for each dye molecule. The relevant electron transfer (ET) and dynamic processes were studied by using the charge different density (CDD) and Newns-Anderson model. The relationship between structure and performance are established. Furthermore, six dyes are designed and examined on the basis of AN-11 to improve optical response and electron injection. It is expected that this study will give theoretical guidance and ideas for finding potential solar cell materials. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Electron-Withdrawing Boron Dipyrromethene Dyes As Visible Light Absorber/Sensitizers on Semiconductor Oxide Surfaces	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						carbazole; BODIPY; electron injection; organic alcohol oxidation; dye-sensitized photoelectrosynthesis cell	CHROMOPHORE-CATALYST ASSEMBLIES; WATER-OXIDATION; ORGANIC SENSITIZERS; SINGLE-SITE; PORPHYRIN	The synthesis, characterization, and electrochemical and photophysical properties of the phosphonate-derivatized carbazole (CBZ) and boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) chromophores in the dyes, BODIPY(CBZ)(2)PO3H2 (8) and BODIPY(Tol)(2)PO3H2 (7), are described. The oxide-bound dyes have been explored as light absorbers in dyesensitized photoelectrosynthesis cell (DSPEC) applications. The BODIPY-CBZ phosphonate ester (6) features a broad, intense UV-visible absorption spectrum with absorptions at 297 and 650 nm that arise from mixed transitions at the CBZ and BODIPY units. Electrochemical measurements on BODIPY(CBZ)(2)Br (4) in 0.1 M [nBu(4)N] [PF6] in dichloromethane, vs normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), reveal reversible oxidations at 1.19 and 1.41 V and a reversible reduction at -0.59 V. On indium tin oxide (ITO) and TiO2, a reversible one-electron oxidation appears for 7 at 0.86 and 0.90 V vs NHE in dichloromethane, respectively, which demonstrates the redox stability on metal oxide surfaces. The results of nanosecond transient absorption measurements on SnO2/TiO2 electrodes provide direct evidence for excited-state electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2 following 590 nm excitation. A longer lifetime for 8(+) compared to 7(+) is consistent with extensive intramolecular charge separation between the CBZ and BODIPY units on the surface. Photoelectrochemical studies on 8 on a SnO2/TiO2 photoanode resulted in sustained photocurrents with current maxima of similar to 200 mu A/cm(2) with hydroquinone added as a reductant under 1 sun (AM1.5 100 mWcm(-2)) illumination at pH 4.5 in 0.1 M acetate buffer and 0.4 M LiClO4. On mixed SnO2/TiO2 electrode surfaces, with the added catalyst [Ru(Mebimpy)((4,4'-(OH)(2)PO-CH2)(2)bpy)(OH2)](2+) and chromophores 7 and 8, addition of 0.1 M benzyl alcohol resulted in sustained photocurrents of 12 and 35 mu A/cm(2), consistent with oxidation to benzaldehyde.

In this work, Erbium tungstate, Er-2(WO4)(3), has been synthesized and used as a novel counter electrode for the DSSCs. A facile method has been utilized to introduction oxygen vacancies in Er-2(WO4)(3) via doping different weight percentages (0-15 wt%) of urea-pretreatment under air or N-2 gas atmosphere. The structural investigation of pristine and urea-treated Er-2(WO4)(3) films using different techniques. The SEM micrograph images revealed the creation of pores and voids are introduced in the morphology surface of Er-2(WO4)(3) films after urea pretreatment which confirms the creation of oxygen vacancies. This may facilitate the charge transfer at Er-2(WO4)(3) counter electrode/electrolyte interface. The optical band gap of the Er-2(WO4)(3) film reduced from 2.05 to 1.57 eV attributed to the creation of vacancies. Different electrical aspects were used to evaluate the electrocatalytic performance of Er-2(WO4)(3) as a counter electrode. The addition of urea (5 wt%) to Er-2(WO4)(3) as counter electrode in presence N-2 environment jumped the power conversion efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) from similar to 0.12% to 4.18% revealed an efficient catalytic performance of urea-treated Er-2(WO4)(3) as counter electrode for the present DSSCs.

Within the framework of the time-dependent density functional theory, the proposed computational studies focus on the precise evaluation of pivotal factors controlling the rates of photoinduced charge-transfer and energy-transfer processes, including electronic coupling, reorganization energy, and threshold energy barrier in the semiclassical Marcus formalism. The estimation of the fluorescent state appears to be the crucial step while explaining the ultrafast electron injection process and the charge recombination at the Marcus inverted region, as revealed by the obtained results. The retardation of charge recombination is facilitated by the insertion of a thiophene moiety between the pi-bridge and the acceptor units. The estimated cold electron injection efficiencies deploying the Onsager-Braun theory, which rely on the computations of cold electron injection lifetime and cold electron lifetime, show a linear correlation with the experimental photovoltaic parameters of the DSSC comprising short-circuit current density, open-circuit voltage, and power conversion efficiency. The outcomes of the present investigation establish a basis for unraveling the mechanism of intricate dynamical processes upon photoexcitation of the sensitizers, as well as devising plausible routes for functional DSSC materials.

Electron Transfer in Rhodamine-TiO2 Complexes Studied as a Function of Chalcogen and Bridge Substitution	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							SENSITIZED SOLAR-CELLS; SEMICONDUCTOR SURFACE; INJECTION DYNAMICS; QUANTUM DYNAMICS; TRANSFER RATES; TIO2; DYES; AGGREGATION; SPECTROSCOPY; PERSISTENCE	Many emerging light-harvesting systems for solar-energy capture depend on absorption of light by molecular dyes and subsequent electron transfer to metal-oxide semiconductors. However, the inhomogeneous electron-transfer process is often misunderstood when analogies from bimolecular electron transfer are used to explain experimental trends. Here, we develop and apply a theoretical methodology that correctly incorporates the semiconductor density of states and the system reorganization energies to explain observed trends in a series of molecular sensitizers. The effects of chalcogen and bridge substitution on the electron transfer in rhodamine-TiO2 complexes are theoretically investigated by combining density functional theory (DFT)/time-dependent DFT calculations and Fermi's golden rule for the rate constant. It is shown that all dyes exhibit tau(eT) < 4 ps. Dyes with thiophene bridges exhibit shorter tau(eT) (similar to 1 ps) than dyes with phenylene bridges (similar to 4 ps). When the planes of the dye core and bridge are fixed at coplanarity, the dye-TiO2 coupling strength is found to increase by a factor of similar to 2 when compared with the Franck-Condon geometry. However, the donor energy level of coplanar dyes falls significantly below the TiO2 conduction band edge so that, despite enhanced coupling, electron transfer is slowed to similar to 20 ps. Similar results appear for the excited triplet states of these dyes, showing that the intersystem crossing to low energy triplet states can increase electron-transfer time constants to 60-240 ps. These results are compared to the results of previous photocatalytic hydrogen generation and dye-sensitized solar cell experiments.

In this work, CaWO4 nanocrystals were prepared by a hydrothermal method. Nanoparticles, nanowires, and micro-sized structures were obtained by controlling the reaction temperature, Ca2+-to-WO42- ratio and type of dopant. The influence of rare earth ions on the morphology and luminescence properties was investigated. Upconversion and downconversion luminescence behaviors showed CaWO4 to be an excellent host for rare earth doping. CaWO4:Er3+ nanowires were also used in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) to improve device performance. Increased light harvesting caused by improved dye loading capacity and enhanced light scattering led to improved cell efficiency. Moreover, reduced charge recombination due to the additional energy levels of CaWO4:Er3+ was another reason for the improved cell efficiency. Therefore, in this work, we demonstrated the synthesis of CaWO4 nanocrystals and the control of their morphology and luminescence by rare earth doping, which has significant future applications in lighting and display. The applications in DSSCs provide a new strategy to achieve high-performance solar cells by using nanocrystals via increased light harvesting and reduced charge recombination. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Using this method, electrodes with a push-pull dye were assembled and characterized by photoelectrochemistry and transient absorption spectroscopy. The dye-sensitized electrodes exhibited hole injection into NiO and good photoelectrochemical stability in water, highlighting the stability of the silatrane anchoring group and the amide linkage. The amide-coupling protocol was further applied to electrodes that contain a molecular proton reduction catalyst for use in photocathode architectures. Evidence for catalyst reduction was observed during photoelectrochemical measurements and via photocathodes.

Influence of Electrolyte Composition on Ultrafast Interfacial Electron Transfer in Fe-Sensitized TiO2-Based Solar Cells	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							INITIO MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; CHARGE-TRANSFER; EXCITATION-ENERGIES; ORBITAL METHODS; DYE; TIO2; COMPLEXES; INJECTION; EFFICIENCY	TiO2-based dye-sensitized solar cells employing Fe(2,2'-bipyridine-4,4'-dicarboxylic acid)(2)(CN)(2)(F2CA) have been studied by spectroscopic, electrochemical, photoelectrochemical, time-resolved spectroscopic, and computational methods in an effort to assess how intercalating and passivating electrolyte additives influence photovoltaic performance in this class of devices. Ru(2,2'-bipyridine-4,4'-dicarboxylic acid)(2)(NCS)(2)(N3)-sensitized titanium dioxide (TiO2) devices were also studied by similar methods to provide a comparative standard. Ground-state spectroscopic and electrochemical measurements show that the dye electronic structure was influenced in a nonsystematic way by the presence of various electrolyte components such as lithium (Li+), tetrabutylammonium (TBA(+)), and pyridyl additives, whereas the conduction band edge of TiO2 was impacted in a systematic way. An order-of-magnitude increase in short-circuit current (J(sc)) and cell efficiency (eta) was observed for F2CA-sensitized devices with our selected electrolytes as compared to electrolyte compositions that are typically employed. These substantial gains in F2CA-sensitized device performance correlated with conduction band edge stabilization attributed to electrolyte cation intercalation. Time-resolved spectroscopic and computational studies explain how stabilization of the conduction band edge, which allows for better dye-conduction band overlap, increases the injection yield for F2CA-TiO2 assemblies. These studies serve to elevate our understanding of how electrolyte composition may affect injection and photovoltaic performance in sensitizer assemblies with short-lived charge-separated excited states.

Initially, a series of (MoxTi1-2xO2-delta)(1-y)(RGO)(y) [x=0.5 to 3.0 mol %; y=0.75 wt.%] NCs was prepared by using in-situ chemical approach. XRD Rietveld refinement reveals the formation of single phase only with substitution of two Ti(IV) ions by single Mo(VI) ions in the ternary NCs. After the well characterizations, these NCs are deposited on the FTO substrate using binder-free doctor blade technique and then these are sensitized with N719 dyes (model protocol) as well as natural pigments and measured under solar simulator for knowing the photovoltaic performances. Among the different photoelectrodes, I-V and IPCE measurements of (Mo0.100Ti0.980O1.990)(0.925)(RGO)(0.075) NCs sensitized with N719 showing the highest power conversion efficiency of 7.58% which is higher to that of TiO2/RGO (eta=5.81%) based photoelectrodes. For the optimized photoelectrode composition with N719, natural pigment Betalain based dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) show the highest efficiency of 2.23% which opposes to an efficiency of 0.38, 1.29, and 1.13% for Lawsone, Curcumin and Anthocyanin sensitized DSSCs, respectively.

High-Redox-Potential Chromophores for Visible-Light-Driven Water Oxidation at Low pH	ACS CATALYSIS			English	Article						chromophores; high redox potentials; photochemical water oxidation; kinetic isotope effect; PCET; homoleptic; oxidative quenching; quantum yields	IRO2 NANOPARTICLE CATALYSTS; EXCITED-STATE PROPERTIES; PHOTOSYSTEM-II; MN4CA CLUSTER; MANGANESE; INSIGHTS; COMPLEX; MECHANISM; LIGANDS; TIO2	Photochemical water oxidation at low pH requires chromophores with adequate photophysical properties and high redox potentials capable of oxidizing the catalysts. We report here a series of homoleptic Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes and their performances in photochemical water oxidation at pH 1 using persulfate as the sacrificial electron acceptor. These chromophores incorporate CF3 or PO3H2 groups to increase the Ru-III/II standard potentials to 1.3-1.6 V versus NHE, while their homoleptic nature retains photophysical properties (absorption spectra, lifetimes, emission energies, emission quantum yields) comparable to [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+). With [(bda)Ru(isq)(2)] as the catalyst, the chromophores promote visible-light-driven water oxidation with high activity at low pH. The chromophores with phosphonate groups as substituents showed higher activity than expected based on driving force arguments. In addition, kinetic isotope effects as high as similar to 3 were measured, suggesting the involvement of concerted proton-coupled transfer pathways between the catalyst and the chromophores with the phosphonate group acting as the proton acceptor. These chromophores therefore carry out the light absorption, charge migration, and proton transfer roles of P-680, Tyr161, and His190 in Photosystem II on a single molecule and are good candidates for photoelectrochemical water oxidation at low pH in dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells.

Dye Aggregation, Photostructural Reorganization and Multiple Concurrent Dye center dot center dot center dot TiO2 Binding Modes in Dye-Sensitized Solar Cell Working Electrodes Containing Benzothiadiazole-Based Dye RK-1	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						DSSC dyes; RK-1; DFT; TDDFT; binding mode; FTIR	NANOCRYSTALLINE TIO2 FILMS; ORGANIC SENSITIZERS; HIGH-EFFICIENCY; ABSORPTION; COMPLEXES	Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are widely considered to be promising contenders for the next generation of photovoltaic devices. The light-harvesting component in the DSSCs, that is, the sensitizers, are adsorbed onto the semiconductor layer to form the photoelectrode that absorbs solar energy and converts it into electrical power. The choice of dye has a profound impact on the DSSC performance. Thus, substantial research efforts have been devoted to the development and testing of a large variety of sensitizers during the past decades. We, herein, focus our attention on the metal-free benzothiadiazole-based dye, 2-cyano-3-(4-(7-(5-(4-(diphenylamino)phenyl)-4-octylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[c] [1,2,5]-thiadiazol-4-yl)phenyl) acrylic acid (RK-1), which exhibits excellent power conversion efficiency and high stability. Simulations and experiments were combined to conduct a systematic study of its optical and structural properties. RK-1 shows a broad absorption band over the visible region and the formation of H aggregates in solution. Deprotonation of the cyanoacrylic acid group in RK-1 occurs upon dye adsorption onto TiO2. This induces a hypsochromic shift of the absorption band. The emission spectrum of RK-1 shows a broad band and a large Stokes shift (6949 cm(-1)), indicating the presence of several different structural reorganization processes during excitation. Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations reveal that intramolecular charge transfer in RK-1 molecules should be predominantly attributed to the HOMO- LUMO transition. DFT modeling also reveals the involvement of the cyano group of RK-1 in anchoring to TiO2, which makes the dye--TiO2 binding structure more stable. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy data prove that bridging bidentate (BB) and COO/CN (A2) binding modes coexist in the RK-1 center dot center dot center dot TiO2 interfacial structure.

Dye Nanoaggregate Structures in MK-2, N3, and N749 Dye center dot center dot center dot TiO2 Interfaces That Represent Dye-Sensitized Solar Cell Working Electrodes	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						dye-sensitized solar cell; X-ray reflectometry; grazing-incidence X-ray scattering (GIXS); nanoaggregate size and separation; sensitization concentration; dye self-assembly; lateral and longitudinal short-range order; coherence length	X-RAY-SCATTERING; RECOMBINATION DYNAMICS; MOLECULAR-ORIENTATION; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; TIO2; INJECTION; OXIDE; ZNO; ADSORPTION; COMPLEXES	The working electrode of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) consists of dye molecules adsorbed onto nanoparticles of a semiconductor such as TiO2. A reliable prediction of the DSSC photovoltaic performance of a given dye requires in-depth knowledge about the precise structure of the dye center dot center dot center dot TiO2 interface. X-ray reflectometry (XRR) and grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) are herein employed to determine the dye center dot center dot center dot TiO2 interfacial structure and associated dye aggregation behavior of three high-performance DSSC dyes, i.e., a metal-free organic dye, MK-2, and the two archetypal ruthenium-based organometallic dyes, N3 and N749 (Black Dye). Results show that all three dyes form nanoaggregates in dye center dot center dot center dot TiO2 interfaces. We determine the dye nanoaggregate separations, sizes, distribution densities, and the extent of short-range order within each dye self-assembly in the longitudinal and lateral directions. Dye center dot center dot center dot TiO2 composites fabricated using dye solutions of varying concentrations are analyzed. We find that nanoaggregates of the three dyes are separated by several hundred nanometers (158-203 nm) in dye center dot center dot center dot TiO2 interfaces that have been fabricated using concentrated dye solutions (0.5 mM or 1.0 mM). MK-2 and N749 dyes also display smaller interparticle separations. Dye nanoparticle diameters are of the order of 156-198 nm, sizes that are comparable to the largest interparticle separations. Thus, no extraneous dye particles can be fitted into gaps between particles, so the dye self-assembly is saturated. Self-assemblies of all three dyes exhibit both lateral and longitudinal short-range order; N3 displays a particularly short coherence length along the TiO2 surface, with extensive structured disorder along the longitudinal direction. The operation of DSSC working electrodes would therefore seem to be dependent on a dye self-assembly that may exhibit several levels of structural granularity and dye aggregation effects.

J	Abdellah, IM; El-Shafei, A				Abdellah, Islam M.; El-Shafei, Ahmed			The molecular engineering, synthesis and photovoltaic studies of a novel highly efficient Ru(ii) complex incorporating a bulky TPA ancillary ligand for DSSCs: donor versus pi-spacer effects	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							SENSITIZED SOLAR-CELLS; OPEN-CIRCUIT VOLTAGE; CHENODEOXYCHOLIC ACID; ELECTRON INJECTION; ENERGY-TRANSFER; LOW-COST; CHROMOPHORES; PERFORMANCE; DESIGN; POWER	A novel Ru(ii) complex, denoted as IA-7, incorporating a bulky donor antenna, was synthesized and characterized as a promising inexpensive alternative to conventional p-n junction solar cells to study the influence of a bulky donor antenna on the light harvesting efficiency (LHE), ground and excited state oxidation potentials and total conversion efficiency of sunlight to electricity (% eta) for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), and the device performance was compared to devices with MH-12 and MH-13 dyes. The incorporation of the bulky donor enriched triphenylamine (TPA) antenna resulted in a considerable increase in J(SC) and eta values for DSSCs, where IA-7 outperformed MH-12 and MH-13 in terms of the total conversion efficiency and achieved a power conversion efficiency (eta) of 8.86% under full sunlight irradiation (100 mW cm(-2)), compared to 8.09% for MH-12 and 8.53% for MH-13, which can be ascribed to the high open circuit voltage (V-OC) of IA-7. Molecular engineering utilizing DFT/TD-DFT was employed to calculate the electronic properties of IA-7, including the HOMO/LUMO isosurfaces, the lowest singlet-singlet electronic transitions (E0-0), and the ground and excited state oxidation potentials, which were in ideal agreement with the empirical results. The electronic distribution of IA-7 indicated that the HOMO is delocalized not only on Ru and NCS, but also on the substituted TPA, and the LUMO is delocalized over 4,4 ' -bipyridyl dicarboxylic acid.

Self-Assembled Chromophore-Catalyst Bilayer for Water Oxidation in a Dye-Sensitized Photoelectrosynthesis Cell	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							INTRAMOLECULAR ELECTRON-TRANSFER; HYDROGEN-PRODUCTION; PHOTOELECTROCHEMICAL CELL; SOLAR FUELS; ORGANIC-DYE; H-2; STATE; PHOTOCATHODE; GENERATION; PHOTOANODE	A new approach is described here for the preparation of water-oxidation photoanodes in a dye-sensitized photoelectrosynthesis cell for water splitting. It is based on a chromophore (C)-catalyst (Cat) assembly prepared by a self-assembled bilayer on a mesoporous SnO2/TiO2 core/shell electrode, FTOISnO2/TiO(2)l-C-Cat. A key feature in the resulting assembly is the in situ "synthesis" by utilization of noncovalent interactions between long alkyl substituents of the chromophore and catalyst components. The photoanode carries out photoelectrochemical water oxidation for more than 3 h with similar to 86% faradaic efficiency for oxygen generation. At pH 7 under 1 sun illumination, the photoanode reaches a photocurrent density of similar to 2.2 mA/cm(2) with an incident photon to current efficiency of 29% at 450 nm. With an injection yield of only similar to 42%, the efficiency of the cell, excluding the losses at the core/shell interface, is a remarkable 67%.

Herein, we report the syntheses, characterization, crystal structures and electronic properties of four [Cu(R(2)Dt(0))(2)](+/2+) (R = Me, iPr) complexes, [Cu(iPr(2)Dt(0))(2)][PF6] (1a), [Cu(iPr(2)Dt(0))(2)][PF6](2) (1b), and [Cu(Me(2)Dt(0))(2)][PF6] (2a), [Cu(Me(2)Dt(0))(2)][PF6](2) (2b), where iPr(2)Dt(0) = N,N '-diisopropyl-1,2-piperazine dithione and Me(2)Dt(0) = N,N '-dimethyl-1,2-piperazine dithione. In addition, the molecular structure of [Cu(iPr(2)Dt(0))(2)][BF4](2)(1c) is also reported. Complexes 1a and 2a crystallized in the triclinic, P1 space group, and 1c crystallized in the monoclinic crystal system, space group C2/(c.) The single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements show that the Cu(I) complexes have a distorted tetrahedral geometry, whereas the Cu(II) complex exhibits a true square-planar geometry. Cu(I) complexes exhibit a low energy charge-transfer band (450-650 nm), which are not observed in Cu(II) complexes. Electrochemical studies of these complexes show both ligand- and metal-based redox couples.

Tailoring the Photoelectrochemical Activity of TiO2 Electrodes by Multilayer Screen-Printing	CHEMCATCHEM			English	Article; Early Access						Photocatalysis; Photoelectrocatalysis; Solar energy conversion; Photoelectrochemistry; Titanium dioxide	THIN-FILM; PHOTOCATALYTIC PROPERTIES; MESOPOROUS TIO2; OXIDATION; METHANOL; WATER; DEGRADATION; THICKNESS; DYNAMICS; ACID	Screen-printing is a commonly used method for the preparation of photoelectrodes. Although previous studies have explored the effect of the number of printed layers on the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells, its interplay with the photoelectrocatalytic properties of the electrodes has rarely been examined. This study focuses on this issue by studying the photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of methanol over TiO2 electrodes. Incident photon-to-current efficiencies reached 87 % at the optimal conditions of monochromatic (338 nm) irradiation of one-layer films at 0.2 V vs NHE. However, the irradiation wavelength and applied bias strongly influenced the relative behavior of the films. For instance, at 0.5 V and 327 nm irradiation, the one-layer electrode was 6 times more efficient than the four-layer one, while at 385 nm the four-layer electrode was 3.5 times more efficient. The results were explained on the basis of differing light absorption properties and charge carrier lifetimes. Modelling and quantification of the electron diffusion length (5.7 mu m) helped to explain why the two-layer electrode (4.89 mu m thick) showed the most consistent efficiencies across all conditions. Complementarily, transient absorption spectroscopy was used to correlate the thicknesses with charge carrier lifetimes. Electron transfer to FTO was apparent only for the thinner electrode. Our work shows that the optimization of photoelectrocatalytic processes should include the number of layers as a key variable.	[Guennemann, Carsten; Curti, Mariano; Eckert, J.

In this Review, we survey the latest advances and examine the key factors affecting upconversion performance, such as spectral overlap, core-shell design and the management of triplet excitons and quenchers at the interface between materials. Although issues such as stability, triplet-state quenching, concentration quenching and reabsorption must still be overcome, smart designs of hybrid nanosystems offer exciting opportunities for applications such as solar photovoltaic devices, deep-tissue biomedical imaging, optogenetics and nanomedicine among others.

The molecular structures of all four photosensitizers were confirmed using FT-IR, H-1 NMR and mass spectrometry. Photovoltaic characteristics of the photosensitizers were evaluated under 1.5 a.m. standard illumination condition, in presence of deoxycholic acid as co-adsorbent, and subsequently compared to the performance of the benchmark, Z907. SD-22 showed an IPCE of 52% and 50% at 440 nm and 550 nm, respectively, a short-circuit photocurrent density (J(SC)) of 17.37 mA cm(-2), open-circuit photovoltage (V-OC) of 0.63 V and fill factor (FF) of 0.66, producing an overall conversion efficiency (eta) of 7.31%, which outperformed Z907 (7.02%) under the same experimental device conditions. The eta of the other photosensitizers is in the following order: SD-22 > SD-28 > SD-26 > SD-24. Photosensitizer SD-22 has N,N'-dialkyl group attached to a benzene ring while SD-24 has N,N'-dialkyl without a benzene ring. The extended conjugation in SD-22 translated into higher overall solar-to-electric conversion efficiency. Substitution of dialkylamino-based ancillary ligands of Ru(II) dyes SD-26 and SD-28 with -OCH3 and -OC6H13 also demonstrated that the photovoltaic performance of polypyridyl ruthenium photosensitizers is a function of the donating power of ancillary ligands as well as the steric effect of alkoxy auxochromes at -ortho position.

The effect of different push-pull molecular motifs containing various donors and attachment of long alkyl chains on photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic performances, along with theoretical calculations were studied comprehensively. In particular, LY03-based DSSCs showed the highest efficiency of 7.04% with a short-circuit photocurrent density (J(SC)) of 14.32 mA cm(-2), an open-circuit photovoltage (V-OC) of 910 mV and a fill factor (FF) of 0.54% under AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm(-2)). The results confirm that improving the molecular rigidity of sensitizer and incorporation of long alkyl chains into an auxiliary acceptor and donor is one of the most effective pathways to prevent "trade-off" effect, which translated into remarkable improvement in open-circuit photovoltage of 0.91 V, hence, enhancing the photovoltaic performance.

Although defects existing at an oxide surface have a significant impact on the electron injection efficiency from the excited state dye-molecule into the oxide, the effects of defects on the electron injection process have not been fully understood in any dye-sensitized system. In this study, we present a systematic evaluation of electron injection into defects using emissive Ru(II) complexes adsorbed on oxide substrates (HCa2Nb3O10 nanosheets and nonstoichiometric SrTiO3-delta), which had different defect densities. Using these oxides, electron injection from adsorbed Ru(II) complexes was observed by time-resolved emission spectroscopy. It was shown that electron injection from the excited state Ru(II) complex into an oxide was influenced by the defect density of the oxide as well as by the excited state oxidation potential (E-ox*) of the Ru(II) complex. Electron injection was clearly accelerated with increasing defect density of the oxide, and was inhibited with increasing electron density of the oxide because of a trap-filling effect. Even though the E-ox* of the Ru(II) complex was more positive than the conduction band edge potential of the oxide, electron injection into defects could be identified when a defective oxide was employed. The electron injection event is discussed in detail, on the basis of the defect density and the energy levels of oxides as well as the E-ox* values of the Ru(II) complexes. Overall, the results suggest that it is possible to estimate the potential of surface defect states in oxide by changing E-ox* of an emissive complex dye.

Inhibiting Charge Recombination in cis-Ru(NCS)(2) Diimine Sensitizers with Aromatic Substituents	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						DSSC; recombination; hole-hopping; regeneration; electron transfer; steric effects	ELECTRON-TRANSFER PROCESSES; SELF-EXCHANGE REACTIONS; METAL-OXIDE SURFACES; RUTHENIUM(II) COMPLEX; DYE REGENERATION; HOLE TRANSPORT; SOLAR-CELLS; ENERGY; TIO2; SPECTROSCOPY	A series of cis-[Ru(LL)(dcbH(2))(NCS)(2)] compounds, where dcbH(2) = 2,2'-bipyridine-4,4'-dicarboxylic acid and LL = 1,10-phenanthroline (Ru(phen)), 4,7-dipyrrole-1,10-phenanthroline (Ru(pyr)), 4,7-diindole-1,10-phenanthroline (Ru(ind)), or 4,7-dicarbazole-1,10-phenanthroline (Ru(cbz)), was investigated for application as sensitizers in mesoporous TiO2 dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). A systematic increase in the number of rings of the aromatic substituents at the 4,7-positions of the 1,10-phenanthroline allowed tuning of the molecular size of the sensitizers and the energy stored in the excited state while maintaining the same ground-state Ru3+/2+ reduction potentials. These small structural changes had a significant influence on the rates and/or efficiencies of electron injection, back-electron transfer, recombination to oxidized mediators, lateral self-exchange electron transfer, and regeneration through iodide oxidation that were reflected in distinct photoelectrochemical performance of full operating DSSCs. The global efficiencies, open-circuit voltages, and short-circuit current densities of the DSSCs consistently followed the trend Ru(pyr) < Ru(ind) < Ru(phen) < Ru(cbz), and the most optimal performance of Ru(cbz) was ascribed to dramatically slower recombination to the oxidized redox mediators. Transient photovoltage and transient absorption experiments both revealed significantly slower recombination as the size of the aromatic substituents increased with Ru(cbz) providing the most promising behavior for application in dye sensitization.

Systematic characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the advanced structural and electronic properties of Mo2C/NCNTs@Co heterostructure, in which the Coembedded and N-doped CNTs with tunable diameters present electron-donating effect and the work function is correspondingly regulated from 4.91 to 4.52 eV, and the size-controlled Mo2C nanoparticles exhibit Pt-like 4d electronic structure and the well matched work function (4.85 eV) with I-/I-3(-) redox couples (4.90 eV). As a result, the conductive NCNTs@Co substrate with fine-tuned energy level alignment accelerates the electron transportation and the electron migration from NCNTs@Co to Mo2C, and the active Mo2C shows high affinity for I-3(-) adsorption and high charge transfer ability for I-3(-) reduction, which reach a decent synergetic catalytic effect in Mo2C/NCNTs@Co heterostructure. The DSSC with Mo2C/NCNTs@Co CE achieves high photoelectric conversion efficiency of 8.82% and exceptional electrochemical stability with a residual efficiency of 7.95% after continuous illumination of 200 h, better than Pt-based cell. Moreover, the synergistic catalytic mechanism toward I-3(-) reduction is comprehensively studied on the basis of structure-activity correlation and DFT calculations. The advanced heterostructure engineering and electronic modulation provide a new design principle to develop the efficient, stable, and economic hybrid catalysts in relevant electrocatalytic fields.

However, the typical efficiency of these solar cells incorporating graphene is below 16%. Therefore, the photovoltaic potential of graphene has not yet been shown. In this work, the use of graphene for concentration applications on III-V multijunction solar cells, which indeed are the solar cells with the highest efficiency, is demonstrated. First, a wide optoelectronic characterization of graphene layers is carried out. Then, the graphene layer is incorporated onto triple-junction solar cells, which decreases their series resistance by 35% (relative), leading to an increase in fill factor of 4% (absolute) at concentrations of 1000 suns. Simultaneously, the optical absorption of graphene produces a relative short-circuit current density decrease in the range of 0% to 1.8%. As a result, an absolute efficiency improvement close to 1% at concentrations of 1000 suns was achieved with respect to triple-junction solar cells without graphene. The impact of incorporating one and two graphene monolayers is also evaluated.

The resultant PPEDOT was employed as counter electrode (CE) in dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). The effect of changing DBEDOT/ZIF-8 ratio was studied and results showed that PPEDOT as CE with DBEDOT/ZIF-8 (1 : 1/3) at 80 degrees C demonstrates comparable performance with traditional Pt (CE) in DSSC. Platinum (Pt) and PPEDOT (1 : 1/3) as CEs showed 5.72 and 5.42% efficiency, respectively. The electrochemical and photo-electrochemical as well as impedance spectra measurements revealed that ZIF-8 as template by simple hydrothermal method is a effective way for preparing PPEDOT (CE) in DSSC, which may open up an alternative choice for the future industrial application. In DSSC, PPEDOT (1 : 1/3) is one of the most promising material used for nano-porous thin film when, it serves as counter electrode due to its appropriate low cost, and easy preparation.

Both F-TiO2 and TiOF2 have been studied extensively for this purpose. However, fabrication of fluorine doped titanium oxide requires the use of dangerous fluorinated chemicals such as trifluoroacetic acid, hydrofluoric acid and fluorine gas which are both difficult to handle and create significant waste detrimental for the environment. Additionally, current procedures for fabrication of FTiO2 and TiOF2 require long heating times which are inefficient, wasting large amounts of energy. Because of these factors, fabrication of F-TiO2, TiOF2 and of other important fluorine doped metal oxides is expensive and dangerous to make. In this work, two new methods were used to greatly improve the safety and efficiency of synthesis. First, the fluorinated waste was eliminated by using the safe and inert polymer, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), as the fluorine source. Second, microwave (MW) irradiation was used to reduce the time and energy required for synthesis by addition of the MW absorber, graphene, into the precursor material. The results show that when using the PVDF fluorine source with conventional oven heating it results in low levels of F-TiO2 which are dependent on heating temperatures. However, when using microwave irradiation high levels of doping were achieved creating both F-TiO2 and TiOF2 in as little as 6 min compared to several hours. This work has shown that by combining both PVDF and microwave irradiation fabrication of F-TiO2 and TiOF2 can now be done safely and efficiently with greatly reduced environmental impact.

Here, a highly elastic and sustainable power source is fabricated for harvesting and storing energy simultaneously from ambient sunshine and human movement. Flexible fiber-shaped dye-sensitized solar cells are smartly integrated with triboelectric nanogenerators and serve as generating set. The supercapacitors as energy storage devices can store direct current energy for the solar cells and alternating current energy from the triboelectric nanogenerators after rectified at the same time. Furthermore, the supercapacitors are easily integrated with generating set due to the same electrode materials with triboelectric nanogenerators. Due to the all flexible devices, the size of the whole power system can be easily tuned and connected with electronic devices to create self-powered wearable electronics.

Factors that Control the Direction of Excited-State Electron Transfer at Dye-Sensitized Oxide Interfaces	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							TRANSFER DYNAMICS; CHARGE INJECTION; THIN-FILMS; TIO2; ENERGY; SNO2; PORPHYRIN; RUTHENIUM; COMPLEX; PHOTOCATHODE	Molecular excited states at conductive and semiconductive interfaces were found to transfer an electron to the oxide (injection) or accept an electron from the oxide (hole transfer). The direction of this electron transfer was determined by the energetic overlap of the metal oxide and sensitizer redox-active states and their electronic coupling. Potentiostatically controlled mesoporous thin films based on a nanocrystalline conductive metal oxide [tin-doped indium oxide (ITO)] and semiconducting metal oxides (TiO2 and SnO2) were utilized with the sensitizers (S) [Ru(bpy)(2) (P)]Br-2 and [Ru(bpz)(2) (P)]Br-2, where bpy is 2,2'-bipyridine, bpz is 2,2'-bipyrazine, and P is 2,2'-bipyridyl-4,4'-diphosphonic acid. For dye-sensitized TiO2, excited-state injection [TiO2 vertical bar S* -> TiO2 (e(-))vertical bar S+] was exclusively observed, and the injection yield decreased at negative applied potentials. In contrast, evidence for both injection [ITO vertical bar S* -> ITO(e(-))vertical bar S+] and hole transfer ([ITO vertical bar S* -> ITO(h(+))vertical bar S-] is reported for ITO and SnO2. Hole transfer became more efficient with negative applied potentials. The direction of electron flow between the metal oxide and excited state sensitizer was correlated with the energetic overlap and the electronic coupling as predicted by Marcus-Gerischer theory. The data reveal that control of the Fermi level enables conductive oxides to function as a photocathode or as a photoanode for solar energy conversion applications.

SnO2 Transparent Printing Pastes from Powders for Photon Conversion in SnO2-Based Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells	CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL			English	Article						dyes; pigments; metal oxide films; reduced photon losses; solar cells; tin	EFFICIENT SCATTERING LAYER; HOLLOW MICROSPHERES; ELECTRON-TRANSPORT; CHARGE-TRANSPORT; LIGHT-SCATTERING; REDOX MEDIATORS; ORGANIC-DYES; FABRICATION; NANOFIBERS; FILM	Tin oxide (SnO2) is the most attractive alternative to titanium oxide (TiO2) with the aim of identifying a more positive conduction band material for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). This study puts forward a protocol based on grinding, sonication, and centrifuge to generate transparent SnO2 pastes to minimize light reflectance losses from the metal oxide. Under optimized conditions, a highly transparent film with substantially enhanced light penetration depth through active layer SnO2 is realized for efficient light harvesting from two different commercially available powders (18 and 35 nm nanoparticle sizes). A ruthenium sensitizer (B11) and two organic sensitizers (NL3 and MK2) are shown to achieve higher or comparable photocurrent densities with SnO2 relative to standard TiO2-based DSCs. SnO2-based DSCs show minimum recombination losses, comparable charge collection efficiencies, and minimal photovoltage losses relative to TiO2 DSCs. Thus, the option of a transparent metal oxide, which can facilitate high photocurrents (>16 mA cm(-2) observed) and lower recombination rates than TiO2 is an attractive material for DSC applications.

Robust, Scalable Synthesis of the Bulky Hagfeldt Donor for Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells	CHEMSUSCHEM			English	Article						amines; dyes; solar cells; Hagfeldt donor; redox shuttles	REDOX SHUTTLES; SILYL-ANCHOR; BATTERY	The bulky triarylamine group commonly referred to as the "Hagfeldt donor" is a key building block found in many of the organic dyes used in dye-sensitized applications such as dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). This building block has gained popularity owing to its presence in many of the best-performing DSC devices reported to date, which use dyes containing this donor group. The Hagfeldt donor provides a desirable 3-dimensional structure that aids in surface protection of electrons injected into the semiconductor from oxidants in the electrolyte, allowing for record-setting cobalt- and copper-based redox shuttles to be utilized more frequently. However, the synthesis of this molecule has proven unreliable for many routes. This study concerns a novel, reliable and scalable five-step synthesis of the Hagfeldt donor.

The nanohybrid with a mass ratio of 1 : 0.50 (i.e., NiSe/GN(0.50)) exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity and electrolyte diffusion. Thus, NiSe/GN(0.50) exhibited an improved photo-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12% (eta = 8.62%) compared to a standard Pt (eta = 7.68%)-based dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). This improved PCE mainly originated from the catalytic ability of NiSe and the multiple interfacial electron transfer pathways of graphene, resulting in enhanced charge transfer and fast tri-iodide reduction kinetics at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface. The results obtained from the cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical AC-impedance (EIS) and Tafel polarization studies validated the synergistic effects of NiSe and GN and the high potential of this nanohybrid as an efficient counter electrode (CE) for DSSCs.

In the present work, all the bianchoring dyes were subjected to photophysical, electrochemical, thermodynamic, photoelectrochemical, and theoretical studies. All of them displayed characteristic lambda(abs) and lambda(emi) in the range of 415-480 and 570-680 nm, respectively. Their optical and electrochemical band gaps were calculated to be in the order of 2.1 to 2.3 eV. The calculated driving forces for electron injection (Delta G(inj)), recombination (Delta G(inj)), and regeneration (Delta G(reg)) processes were found to be negative, showing the feasibility of these processes, while their DFT studies clearly indicated the directional flow of electrons within the dye in the cell. The devices with DDC as sensitizer displayed the highest conversion efficiency of 2.53%, whereas DDB exhibited the maximum of 7.69% when employed as a cosensitizer along with Ru (II) based HD-2 dye. Finally, EIS circuit fitting was carried out in order to obtain different interface resistance values to study the fundamental processes of energy conversion.

Photoinduced Charge Separation in Retinoic Acid on TiO2: Comparison of Three Anchoring Modes	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							ELECTRON-PARAMAGNETIC-RESONANCE; SENSITIZED SOLAR-CELLS; CARBOXYLIC-ACID; N719 SENSITIZER; ANATASE 101; ADSORPTION; DFT; EFFICIENCY; SURFACE; FILMS	A complete understanding of the interaction between the dye and the semiconductor is essential for the design of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) because the chemical interactions and the electron coupling between semiconductor and dye directly impact electron transfer and the performance of the dye-sensitized photoanode. Three anchoring modes of retinoic acid (RA), which contains a carboxylic acid group adsorbed on TiO2, were studied by DFT calculations. Of the three anchoring modes, the mode involving surface Ti-OH groups has the highest driving force for photoinduced electron transfer. The mixing of the RA's lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) with the conduction band states of TiO2 is also the highest. The calculated results are supported by EPR measurements, which show enhanced light-driven charge separation from increasing the density of the Ti-OH groups on the surface of TiO2. The anchoring modes affect the bond length, degree of conjugation, energies of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and LUMO, and the mixing of the dye's excited states with the conduction band states of a semiconductor.

In this work, we present a halogen element (chlorine) doping strategy to design low-cost perovskite-type electrocatalysts with enhanced IRR activity and stability. The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) assembled by the LaFeO2.965-delta Cl0.035 cathode delivers an attractive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.4% with a remarkable PCE enhancement factor of 23% compared with Pt, which is higher than most of the reported non-Pt DSSC cathodes. Attractively, LaFeO2.965-delta Cl0.035 displays superior IRR activity/stability and structural stability in the I-3(-)/I--based electrolyte compared to pristine LaFeO3 because chlorine doping facilitates the creation of oxygen vacancies (active sites) and enhances surface acidity simultaneously. This study provides a new way for designing outstanding IRR electrocatalysts, which could be applied to many redox couple-mediated photo/electrochemical devices.

Atomic layer deposition of SnOx onto mesoporous, nanocrsytalline TiO2 and SnO2 thin films	POLYHEDRON			English	Article						Atomic Layer Deposition; Tetrakisdimethylamidotin; Mesoporous thin film; Orthorhombic SnO2; Dye-sensitized photoelectrosynthesis cell	X-RAY; ORTHORHOMBIC SNO2; ELECTRON-TRANSFER; RAMAN-SPECTRUM; STRUCTURAL-CHARACTERIZATION; RECOMBINATION DYNAMICS; NANOCRYSTALLINE SNO2; ULTRATHIN SNO2; SOLAR-CELLS; TIN	The atomic layer deposition of tetrakisdimethylamidotin(IV) and water on mesoporous thin films of nanocrystalline anatase TiO2, rutile SnO2, and rutile TiO2 was investigated. For all deposition conditions tested, highly oxygen deficient coatings were created; purge time and temperature were found to be the factors most affecting the stoichiometry. Long purge times and a 180 degrees C deposition temperature produced the least oxygen-deficient coatings. Under these conditions, crystalline rutile SnO2 deposited epitaxially on rutile SnO2 substrates. As-deposited SnOx coatings on anatase TiO2 and rutile TiO2 substrates were mostly smooth and amorphous, but contained various SnOx nanocrystals along the surface of the substrate nanocrystals. Post-deposition annealing at 450-500 degrees C results in the delamination of the SnOx shells from the nanocrystalline cores concomitant with the formation of SnO2 nanocrystals that are speckled along the periphery of the substrate nanocrystals. On anatase substrates the SnOx coatings form the rare orthorhombic phase of SnO2 after annealing, while rutile SnO2 nanocrystals are formed on rutile TiO2 substrates. The emergence of orthorhombic SnO2 on anatase TiO2 substrates and rutile SnO2 on rutile TiO2 substrates is rationalized by interfacial lattice mismatch and strain between the core and shell materials.

Surface anchored self-assembled reaction centre mimics as photoanodes consisting of a secondary electron donor, aluminium(iii) porphyrin and TiO2 semiconductor	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							PHOTOSYNTHETIC REACTION-CENTER; CHARGE SEPARATION; WATER-OXIDATION; TETRATHIAFULVALENE; CATALYST; INJECTION; ANTENNA; STATES	A series of vertically assembled photoanodes, consisting of 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(3,4,5-trifluorophenyl)aluminum(iii) porphyrin (AlPorF(3)), a pyridine appended electron donor (PTZ-Py, PTZ = phenothiazine; TTF-Py, TTF = tetrathiafulvalene), and semiconductor TiO2, have been fabricated by exploiting the unique axial properties of AlPorF(3). The new photoanodes were characterized by steady-state and transient spectroscopic techniques. Transient-absorption studies show that in the absence of a donor, both the photoanodes (AlPorF(3)-TiO2 and AlPorF(3)-Ph-TiO2) exhibit electron injection from AlPorF(3) into the conduction band of TiO2 and the injection efficiencies are strongly dependent on the linker. Faster electron injection and recombination is revealed when AlPorF(3) is directly bound to TiO2. Although a secondary electron donor is coordinated to AlPorF(3) (viz., Donor-Py-AlPorF(3)-TiO2 and Donor-Py-AlPorF(3)-Ph-TiO2), the primary charge separation occurs in the form of electron injection from AlPorF(3) to TiO2 followed by a secondary process involving photooxidation of the donor (PTZ and TTF) with AlPorF(3)(+). The estimated electron injection lifetimes and the AlPorF(3)(+) decay lifetimes strongly depend on the electron richness of the donor; the higher the electron density of the donor, the faster the electron injection and photooxidation witnessed. The photoanodes with TTF (TTF-Py-AlPorF(3)-TiO2 and TTF-Py-AlPorF(3)-Ph-TiO2) show faster injection and shorter decay lifetimes of AlPorF(3)(+) over their PTZ counterparts (PTZ-Py-AlPorF(3)-TiO2 and PTZ-Py-AlPorF(3)-Ph-TiO2). The observed trends suggest that the strong secondary electron donor enhances the injection and the subsequent photooxidation processes in the investigated photoanodes. The successful mimicking of a sequential charge-separation process makes aluminum(iii) porphyrins potential sensitizers for the construction of photoanodes, especially for photocatalytic and dye-sensitized solar cells for conversion and storage of solar energy.

One hurdle to overcome regarding the use of native membranes in these devices is their limited lifespans. In this study, we used stabilizers to increase the long-term viability of biomolecules in vitro, thereby alleviating this challenge. In this regard, it is known that osmolytes, such as glycine betaine (GB) and sucrose, preserve photosynthetic activity in isolated photosystems. Upon investigation of the thermal protection properties of GB and sucrose in thylakoid-based dye-sensitized solar cells, we report that the addition of GB and sucrose to the thylakoid photosensitizer maintains nonzero photocurrent in the thylakoid-based solar cell upon heating to 50 degrees C. At 50 degrees C, the GB-containing cell displayed about a fourfold increase in photocurrent than the control cell, in which the photocurrent was decreased to nearly zero. The addition of 0.5M and 1M sucrose has respectively caused nearly 40% and 70% increases in photoinduced electron transfer activity over the control at 35 degrees C. Similarly, though to a lesser extent, 1M GB caused an approximate 40% increase in electron transfer activity as well. Moving forward, this approach will be extended to alternative membrane protein isolation strategies, allowing for an accurate comparison with traditional detergent-isolated complexes, with the ultimate goal of developing a cost-effective and sustainable solar cell.

Dye-sensitized solar cells are a promising third-generation photovoltaic technology that can add functionality and lower costs to enhance the value proposition of solar power generation in the early years of the 21st century. Through a series of technological forecasting studies analyzing the R&D patterns and trends in Dye-sensitized solar cells technology over the past several years, we have come to realize that validating previous forecasts is useful for improving ST&I policy processes. Yet, rarely do we revisit forecasts or projections to ascertain how well they fared. Moreover, few studies pay much attention to assessing FTA techniques. In this paper, we compare recent technology activities with previous forecasts to reveal the influencing factors that led to differences between past predictions and actual performance. Beyond our main aim of checking accuracy, in this paper we also wish to gain some sense of how valid those studies were and whether they proved useful to others in some ways.

J	Wang, JY; Cui, Y; Wang, D				Wang, Jiangyan; Cui, Yi; Wang, Dan			Design of Hollow Nanostructures for Energy Storage, Conversion and Production	ADVANCED MATERIALS			English	Review						dye-sensitized solar cells; hollow nanostructure design; rechargeable batteries; structure-performance correlation; supercapacitors	SENSITIZED SOLAR-CELLS; LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; SOLUTION-PHASE SYNTHESIS; TEMPLATE-FREE SYNTHESIS; CORE-SHELL; HYDROGEN EVOLUTION; FACILE SYNTHESIS; HIGH-CAPACITY; COMPLEX NANOMATERIALS; GALVANIC REPLACEMENT	Hollow nanostructures have shown great promise for energy storage, conversion, and production technologies. Significant efforts have been devoted to the design and synthesis of hollow nanostructures with diverse compositional and geometric characteristics in the past decade. However, the correlation between their structure and energy-related performance has not been reviewed thoroughly in the literature. Here, some representative examples of designing hollow nanostructure to effectively solve the problems of energy-related technologies are highlighted, such as lithium-ion batteries, lithium-metal anodes, lithium-sulfur batteries, supercapacitors, dye-sensitized solar cells, electrocatalysis, and photoelectrochemical cells. The great effect of structure engineering on the performance is discussed in depth, which will benefit the better design of hollow nanostructures to fulfill the requirements of specific applications and simultaneously enrich the diversity of the hollow nanostructure family. Finally, future directions of hollow nanostructure design to solve emerging challenges and further improve the performance of energy-related technologies are also provided.

The complex microscopic essence of sensitization effect induced by additive can be revealed successfully by an in-depth interpretation on the inherent relations of the open-circuit photovoltage with fundamental electronic properties, i.e. Fermi energy, molecular orbital, dipole moment, electrostatic potential and work function. There is an explicit inverse correlation between the change of energy gap (E Delta(LUMO-HOMO)) and Fermi energy shift (E-Delta Fermi) through the comparison among different additives adsorption under the same conditions of surface and solvent, namely, the smaller E Delta(LUMO-HOMO) corresponds to the bigger E-Delta Fermi. The more positive E-Delta Fermi (i.e. negative potential shift) results in the higher open-circuit photovoltage of dye-sensitized solar cells. Moreover, the E Delta(LUMO-HOMO) is in the order TiO2 (1 0 1) < (1 0 0) < (0 0 1) for every additive adsorption, exactly opposite to the order of surface stability. Total dipole moment is more suitable than its component normal to the TiO2 surface for measuring the sensitization performances of different species of additives. The smaller work function contributes to the bigger E-Delta Fermi of the sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2. The influences of acetonitrile on the sensitization performances of five additives are diversified, better for MPN, NBB and NMB, general for GNCS, and the worst for TBP.

The hydrangea MoS2 powder is composited with rGO to serve as a low-cost and non-platinum counter electrode (CE) to improve photovoltaic performance for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The Tafel polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) indicate that the MoS2/rGO counter electrode has exceptional electrocatalytic ability and reduction reaction kinetics for the I-/I-3(-) couples on the counter electrode, which is due to hydrangea structure MoS2 formed on rGO surface and matrix as well as the MoS2/rGO composite strongly attached on FTO substrate. The DSSC with novel MoS2/rGO CE achieves a higher power conversion efficiency of 6.72% than that with Pt CE (5.74%) under standard sunlight illumination.

J	Abdelnasser, S; Sakr, MA; Serry, M				Abdelnasser, Shady; Sakr, Mahmoud A.; Serry, Mohamed			Nanostructured graphene-platinum-PEDOT electrode materials for enhanced Schottky performance and power conversion applications	MICROELECTRONIC ENGINEERING			English	Article							COUNTER-ELECTRODE; HIGH-EFFICIENCY; LOW-COST; FILMS; NANOTUBES	Counter electrode are crucial components in determining the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells. An ideal electrode material would have high conductivity (i.e. high electron mobility) and excellent catalytic activity for electrolyte reduction. Various electrode materials have been investigated, however most materials demonstrate either the catalytic activity or the conductivity. In this paper, we investigated combining the catalytic and electrical conductivity for enhanced electrode materials by fabricating of a hybrid structure consisting of PEDOT/graphene/Pt/semiconductor heterojunction. A hybrid structure was successfully fabricated by atomic layer deposition of Pt over the surface of n-silicon followed by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition of graphene sheets and then an immediate spin coating of PEDOT prepared by solution casting polymerization. The hybridstructure showed a noticeable difference in the reflection/absorption measurements where the absorption drastically increased upon PEDOT deposition. The photoluminescence emission spectra showed two main peaks at 525 nm and 700 nm, with an enhancement in the band-to-band PL process attributed to the separation of the photo-generated charges and the excitonic PL signal related to surface defects and states. Moreover, the electrical characterization of the hybrid electrodes showed a response of about 7.15 x 10(-6) A, which is nearly 7 times that of the bare graphene, as well as electrical stability for a period of 300 s under dark conditions.

The effects of hydrophobic chain length of the co-adsorbent and the effects of tetrazole anchoring group on the properties of DSSCs containing the previously reported dye HD-2 were compared with the benchmark deoxycholic acid (DCA). The charge-transfer resistance of the dye/TiO2 interface followed the order HD-2-DCA > HD-2-LTz-2 > HD-2-LTz-3 > HD-2-LTz-1. However, the V-oc of the dye HD-2 with co-adsorbent DCA was 0.66 V, for the dye HD-2 with co-adsorbent LTz-1, it was 0.70 V, for the dye HD-2 with co-adsorbent LTz-2, it was 0.68 V and for the dye HD-2 with co-adsorbent LTz-3, it was 0.67 V. Co-adsorbents LTz-1, LTz-2 and LTz-3 achieved a mean solar-to-power conversion efficiency (%eta), for the three devices, of 8.29, 7.63 and 8.49, respectively, compared to 7.76 for DCA under the same experimental device conditions. For the LTz-3 co-adsorbent, the results can be attributed to the repellent effect of the long alkyl chain. For LTz-1 and LTz-2 co-adsorbents, it is possible that the more compact layer formed improves electron-injection efficiency into TiO2.

However, its utilization is largely hindered by poor cyclability and mechanical rigidity due to the lack of a flexible and durable catalyst electrode. Herein, flexible fiber-shaped Li-CO2 batteries with ultralong cycle-life, high rate capability, and large specific capacity are fabricated, employing bamboo-like N-doped carbon nanotube fiber (B-NCNT) as flexible, durable metal-free catalysts for both CO2 reduction and evolution reactions. Benefiting from high N-doping with abundant pyridinic groups, rich defects, and active sites of the periodic bamboo-like nodes, the fabricated Li-CO2 battery shows outstanding electrochemical performance with high full-discharge capacity of 23328 mAh g(-1), high rate capability with a low potential gap up to 1.96 V at a current density of 1000 mA g(-1), stability over 360 cycles, and good flexibility. Meanwhile, the bifunctional B-NCNT is used as the counter electrode for a fiber-shaped dye-sensitized solar cell to fabricate a self-powered fiber-shaped Li-CO2 battery with overall photochemical-electric energy conversion efficiency of up to 4.6%. Along with a stable voltage output, this design demonstrates great adaptability and application potentiality in wearable electronics with a breath monitor as an example.

Thienopyrroledione-Based Photosensitizers as Strong Photoinduced Oxidants: Oxidation of Fe(bpy)(3)(2+) in a > 1.3 V Dye-Sensitized Solar Cell	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						high voltage solar cells; photoinduced oxidant; thienopyrroledione sensitizer; dye-sensitized solar cells; organic sensitizer	ORGANIC-DYES; PHOTOVOLTAIC PROPERTIES; CHARGE-TRANSFER; REDOX SHUTTLES; ENERGY-LEVELS; RECOMBINATION; ACCEPTOR; OPTIMIZATION; REGENERATION; DYNAMICS	The design of visible light absorbing organic dyes as strong photoinduced oxidants is needed for many potential applications in energy production and storage. To access more positive potentials, the electron deficient thienopyrroledione building block is promising as a pi-bridge combined with weak aryl-ether donor groups and the phenyl-cyanoacetic acid acceptor group. The thienopyrroledione (TPD) building block is compared to the ubiquitous benzothiadiazole (BTD) building block, which was recently used in a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) device with >1.4 V photovoltage output. The variation in dye donor group is studied through UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and electrochemical methods both in solution and on TiO2 films. The TPD building block resulted in a more positive ground state and excited state oxidation potential, a higher photocurrent (up to 3.5 mA/ cm(2)), and a higher power conversion efficiency (up to 2.9%) than a BTD analogue while retaining comparable photovoltages (similar to 1.3 versus similar to 1.4 V). Computational analysis was used to better understand the optical properties of the thienopyrroledione-based dyes showing overlap of orbitals at the TPD bridge in the S-0 and S-1 states. The dyes were analyzed in high voltage-DSC devices with a challenging to oxidize redox shuttle, Fe(bpy)(3)(2+), at 1.37 V versus NHE.

The dyes' photophysical and electrochemical properties, theoretical calculations, and dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) performances have been investigated. Electrochemical measurement data indicate that varying the pi-conjugacy system can tune the HOMO and LUMO energy levels. A high molar extinction coefficient combined with a broad absorption spectrum helps to reinforce the dyes' light harvesting ability; therefore, it could help to increase the J(SC) of the DSSCs. Among the four dyes, AFL7 bearing the bithiophene bridge achieves the best photocurrent performance with a J(SC) value of 16.94 mA cm(-2), corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency eta of 7.92% under standard AM 1.5 G conditions (that of N719 dye was 8.53% under the same conditions). The results show that the dyes based on the triarylamine donor containing fluorenyl and biphenyl moieties are promising candidates for improving the performance of DSSCs.

Effects of changes on temperature and fluorine concentration in the structural, optical and electrical properties of SnO2:F thin films	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS			English	Article							SPRAY-DEPOSITED FLUORINE; TIN OXIDE-FILMS; SOL-GEL; TRANSPARENT; THICKNESS; PYROLYSIS; CONSTANTS	Thin films of SnO2:F (FTO) were deposited on glass substrates using the spray pyrolysis technique. Tin dichloride (SnCl2 center dot 2H(2)O) was used as a precursor in the starting solution. The first group of samples was prepared adding ammonium fluoride (NH4F) to the previous mixture in different amounts with respect to tin weight concentration (F/Sn = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15 and 0.20) and deposited at 475 degrees C. The second group of films was deposited at different temperatures, from T = 475 to 550 degrees C with a step of Delta T = 25 degrees C and F/Sn = 0.15 wt. The fluorine and deposition temperature dependencies cause notable changes in the FTO system. The effects on the structure (phase, crystallite size, and microstrain) were investigated using X-ray diffraction associated with Rietveld refinement. The optical properties were studied using the UV-Visible spectrum, and it was fit using the Drude-Lorentz classical dispersion model. The electrical measurements were obtained by four-point Van der Pauw technique. Also, electrical parameters calculated through the Drude contribution, such as resistivity and mobility, were compared with those found in Hall-effect measurements. The FTO with the best figure of merit was integrated as a transparent electrode in a dye-sensitized solar cell.

Activated coconut shell charcoal based counter electrode for dye-sensitized solar cells	ORGANIC ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Dye-sensitized solar cell; Activated coconut shell charcoal; Counter electrode	CATALYSTS; GRAPHITE	Current studies on dye-sensitized solar cells are mainly focus on fabricating low-cost cell with high performances. Cost of dye-sensitized solar cells depends mainly on the counter electrode material where the best catalyst for triiodide reduction at the counter electrode is platinum, which is highly expensive. Among various non-platinum counter electrode catalysts, carbon-based materials stand out to be the best alternative as far as low-cost and ready abundance are concerned. A simple procedure is described for producing high electrical conductivity activated charcoal from coconut shells and depositing it on conducting tin oxide glass as a thin film, to be used as the counter electrode for dye-sensitized electrolytic solar cells. The activated coconut shell charcoal catalytic layer which is subjected to this work had very good adhesion between the particles as well as to the conducting tin oxide glass substrate. The efficiency of 7.85% obtained exceeds, values obtained from other forms of activated carbon derived from bio-materials.	[Kumarasinghe, K. D. M. S. P. K.; Kumara, G. R. A.; Liyanage, D.

An Insulating Al2O3 Overlayer Prevents Lateral Hole Hopping Across Dye-Sensitized TiO2 Surfaces	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						dye-sensitized; ruthenium polypyridyl; anisotropy; hole hopping; lateral self-exchange	SELF-EXCHANGE REACTIONS; INTERFACIAL ELECTRON-TRANSFER; MOLECULAR WATER-OXIDATION; ATOMIC LAYER DEPOSITION; TRANSFER DYNAMICS; POLYPYRIDYL DYES; SOLAR-CELLS; ENERGY; CATALYST; DEPENDENCE	Three chromophores of the general form [Ru(bpy')(2)(4,4'-(PO3H2)2-2,2'-bipyridine)](2+), where bpy' is 4,4'-(C(CH3)(3))2-2,2'-bipyridine (Ru(dtb)(2)P); 4,4'-(CH3O)2-2,2'-bipyridine (Ru(OMe)(2)P), and 2,2'-bipyridine (RuP) were anchored to mesoporous thin films of TiO2 nanocrystallites at saturation surface coverages to investigate lateral self-exchange Ru-III/(II) intermolecular hole hopping in 0.1 M LiClO4/CH3CN electrolytes. Hole hopping was initiated by a potential step 500 mV positive of the E-1/2 (Ru-III/(II)) potential or by pulsed laser (532 nm, 8 ns fwhm) excitation and monitored by visible absorption chronoabsorptometry and time-resolved absorption anisotropy measurements, respectively. The hole hopping rate constant k(R) extracted from the potential step data revealed self-exchange rate constants that followed the trend: TiO2[Ru(OMe)(2)P (k(et) = 1.4 x 10(6) s(-1)) > TiO2 vertical bar RuP (7.1 X 10(5) s(-1)) > TiO2 vertical bar Ru(dtb)(2)P (6.5 x 10(4) s(-1)). Analysis of the anisotropy data with Monte Carlo simulations provided hole hopping rate constants for TiO2 vertical bar RuP and TiO2 vertical bar Ru(dtb)(2)P that were within experimental error the same as that measured with the potential step. The hole hopping rate constants were found to trend with the TiO2(e(-))vertical bar Ru-III -> TiO2 vertical bar Ru-II charge recombination rate constants. The atomic layer deposition of an similar to 10 angstrom layer of Al2O3 on top of the dye-sensitized films was found to prevent hole hopping by both initiation methods even though the chromophore surface coverage exceeded the percolation threshold and excited-state injection was efficient. The dramatic hole hopping turnoff was attributed to a larger outer-sphere reorganization energy for self-exchange due to the restricted access of electrolyte to the redox active chromophores. The implications of these findings for solar energy conversion applications are discussed.

The spectral and electrochemical redox properties of these new dyes were studied and compared with trans-A(2)BC Zn(II) porphyrin dyes under similar experimental conditions. Red-shifted, broadened absorption peaks, lower fluorescence quantum yields, and shortened lifetimes were observed for the A(3)B dyes as compared to zinc tetraphenylporphyrin control, ZnTPP. DFT optimized structures suggested effective charge separation related to enhanced charge injection efficiency. Driving force for electron injection (Delta G(inj)) and dye regeneration (Delta G(reg)) calculated from the spectral and electrochemical studies predicted facile electron injection from excited dye into semiconductor TiO2 in the constructed solar cells. Phenothiazine appended dye (KP-TriPTZ-Zn) showed the highest eta value of 7.3 % for PCE with greater J(sc) and V-oc values due to its better light harvesting ability and reduced dye aggregation as compared to other dyes. Our studies demonstrate that the dyes having multiple electron-donating groups exhibit higher photon-to-current conversion efficiency.

The structural changes and the corresponding electrocatalytic properties in terms of cathodic peak current density and charge transfer resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface for Co0.50Ni0.50Se/GN nanohybrid with respect to the mass ratio between Co0.50Ni0.50Se nanoparticles and graphene nanosheets have been investigated. Co0.50Ni0.50Se/GN(0.50) exhibits higher electrocatalytic activity and lower charge transfer resistance than other Co0.50Ni0.50Se/GN nanohybrids and std. platinum (Pt) counter electrodes. Finally, the DSSC fabricated with Co0.50Ni0.50Se/GN(0.50) as the counter electrode delivered photo-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.42%, which is higher than that of DSSC fabricated with Co0.50Ni0.50Se (7.59%) and std. Pt (7.68%) counter electrodes. This improved electrochemical performance and higher PCE incited by the synergistic effect of Co and Ni in Co0.50Ni0.50Se nanoparticles, as well as Co0.50Ni0.50Se and graphene, could make Co0.50Ni0.50Se/GN(0.50) nanohybrid as a promising low-cost Pt-free counter electrode for DSSC.

These molecules can serve as molecular building blocks with application in light emitting diodes, catalysts, and dye-sensitized solar cells. A study of the effect changes in aromatic structure might have on their relative photophysical responses is therefore of interest. Steady-state absorption and emission spectra, Lippert-Mataga plots, fluorescence lifetimes, and absolute quantum yields were used in tandem with time dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations to investigate solvatochromism, excited state decay, and the relative energies of singlet and triplet excited states. It was found that changes in aromaticity affect the energetic order and character of the excited singlet and triplet states differently among these fluorenones as solvent polarity is varied. The observed fluorescence emission from all these molecules can be understood in terms of their relative ability to undergo intersystem crossing. Additional calculations on the related benzo[c]fluorenone predict that its solvatochromic behavior should resemble that of benzo[a]fluorenone.

Synthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles at low hydrothermal temperature and its performance for DSSC sensitized using natural dye extracted from Melastoma malabathricum L. seeds	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH			English	Article						dye-sensitized solar cell; Melastoma malabathricum L; natural dye; power conversion efficiency; solvent extraction	SOLAR-CELLS; PIGMENTS; EFFICIENCY	Efficiency of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) device depends on its semiconductor layer and the sensitizing dye to absorb the light. This work seeks to obtain the best solvent for the natural dye extraction from Melastoma malabathricum L. seeds. The extracted dye is used as sensitizer on TiO2 nanoparticles produced via hydrothermal but optimized at relatively low temperature. Infrared characterization of the extracted dyes showed differences in functional groups using different solvents, whereas ultraviolet visible examination of the dyes showed differences in intensity along the spectrum ranges of 600 to 400 nm with maximum absorption around 550 to 500 nm. Thermal analysis revealed that the natural dye should be stable around room temperature. Analysis on the synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles showed that the average crystallite size reported in the previous work is consistent with crystallite sizes observed in the transmission electron microscope images. Photoactivity examination showed that the DSSC sensitized using natural dye extracted with ethanol containing 20% distilled water on TiO2 synthesized at 150 degrees C has an efficiency of 5.7%, whereas the one on commercial TiO2 P25 Degussa has an efficiency of 3.0%. The DSSC device sensitized using commercial dye on TiO2 synthesized at 150 degrees C has an efficiency of 4.4%, whereas the one on TiO2 P25 Degussa has an efficiency of 4.0%. This result is promising for further development of the DSSC device using TiO2 nanoparticles synthesized at low hydrothermal temperature and sensitized with the natural dye.

Heterodimetallic Ferrocenyl Dithiophosphonate Complexes of Nickel(II), Zinc(II) and Cadmium(II) as Sensitizers for TiO2-Based Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells	CHEMISTRYSELECT			English	Article						Crystal structures; DSSC; Electrical impedance spectroscopy; Ferrocenyl-dithiophosphonates; Group 12 elements	LIGHT-HARVESTING PROPERTIES; TRANSITION-METAL-COMPLEXES; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; ENERGY-CONVERSION; PHOTOCHEMISTRY; SPECTROSCOPY; EFFICIENCY; PHOTOREACTIVITY; RECOMBINATION; NANOCLUSTER	The formation, characterization, and dye sensitized solar cell application of nickel(II), zinc(II) and cadmium(II) ferrocenyl dithiophosphonate complexes were investigated. The multidentate monoanionic ligand [S(2)PFc(OH)](-) (L1) was synthesized. The reaction between metal salt precursors and L1 produced Ni(II) complexes of the type [Ni{S2P(Fc)(OH)}(2)] (1) (molar ratio 1:2), and a tetranickel(II) complex of the type [Ni-2{S2OP(Fc)}(2)](2) (2) (molar ratio (1:1). It also produced a Zn(II) complex [Zn{S2P(Fc)(OH)}(2)](2) (3), and a Cd(II) complex [Cd{S2P(Fc)(OH)}(2)](2) (4). Complexes 1-4 were characterized by H-1 and P-31 NMR, FTIR and elemental analysis, and complexes 1 and 2 were additionally analyzed by X-ray crystallography. The first examples of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) co-sensitized with ferrocenyl dithiophosphonate complexes 1-4 are reported. Co-sensitization with the ruthenium dye N719, produced the dye materials (3)-N719 (eta=8.30%) and (4)-N719 (eta=7.78%), and they were found to have a better overall conversion efficiency than the pure Ru N719 dye standard (eta=7.14%) under the same experimental conditions. The DSSCs were characterized using UV/vis, cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), photovoltaic- (I-V curves), and performing incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) measurements.

A Silicon-Based Heterojunction Integrated with a Molecular Excited State in a Water-Splitting Tandem Cell	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							HYDROGEN GENERATION; H-2 EVOLUTION; P-SI; SOLAR; CATALYSTS; ELECTRODES; EFFICIENCY; COMPLEXES; CO2; PHOTOREDUCTION	Semiconductor-based photocathodes with high light-absorption capability are of interest in the production of solar fuels, but many of them are limited by low efficiencies due to rapid interfacial back electron transfer. We demonstrate here that a nanowire-structured p-type Si (p-Si) electrode, surface-modified with a perylene-diimide derivative (PDI'), can undergo photoreduction of a surface-bound, water reduction catalyst toward efficient H-2 evolution under a low applied bias. At the electrode interface, the PDI' layer converts green light into high-energy holes at its excited state for extraction of photogenerated electrons at the photoexcited p-Si. The photogenerated electrons at the reduced PDI' are subsequently transferred to the molecular H-2-evolution catalyst. Involvement of the photoexcited PDI' enables effective redox separation between the electrons at the reduced catalyst and the holes at the valence band of p-Si. The heterojunction photocathode was used in a tandem cell by coupling with a dye-sensitized photoanode for solar-driven water splitting into H-2 and O-2.	[Shan, Bing; Brenneman, M.

Various composition of potassium iodide (KI)-based nanocomposite (PEO/PMMA/KI/I-2/x wt% ZnO nanorods, x = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10) polymer solid electrolytes (NCPSEs) films were prepared by solution casting technique. Structural properties of the prepared solid electrolytes are studied by X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Among the prepared NCPSEs, 6 wt% sample of solid electrolyte showed high conductivity of 4.698 x 10(-5) S/cm. The relaxation and dynamics of charge carriers are studied by analyzing complex conductivity and dielectric permittivity through power law along with the contribution of electrode polarization and Havriliak-Negami formalism, respectively, for the prepared polymer solid electrolytes to find out their usefulness for dye-sensitized solar cell applications.

The doping is done in a two-stage cost effective process and is found to result in uniform doping concentration, without any surface layer formation, in the nanotubes. Detailed structural, compositional, optical and electrical analyses are done on the nanotubes doped with copper metal. The cu metal doping is found to produce tuning of the electrical and optical properties. The doped tubes with increased conductivity are better suited in dye sensitized solar cells (dsscs) whereas enhanced visible light absorbing capacity makes them better candidates for photocatalytic applications. Further the success of this method in doping TiO2 nanotubes with any metal of choice is demonstrated by testing aluminum metal doping in the nanotubes.

Their ability to be fabricated on flexible substrates, or as fibers, also makes them attractive as passive energy harvesters in wearable devices and textiles. Cosensitization has emerged as a method that affords efficiency gains in DSCs, being most celebrated via its role in nudging power conversion efficiencies of DSCs to reach world-record values; yet, cosensitization has a much wider potential for applications, as this review will show. Cosensitization is a chemical fabrication method that produces DSC working electrodes that contain two or more different dyes with complementary optical absorption characteristics. Dye combinations that collectively afford a panchromatic absorption spectrum emulating that of the solar emission spectrum are ideal, given that such combinations use all available sunlight. This review classifies existing cosensitization efforts into seven distinct ways that dyes have been combined in order to generate panchromatic DSCs. Seven cognate molecular-engineering strategies for cosensitization are thereby developed, which tailor optical absorption toward optimal DSC-device function.

By investigating the use of the porphyrin-based YD2-o-C8 and YDD6, and the organic chromophore TTAR, which can act as complementary absorbers, we are able to enhance the capture of incoming light across the solar spectrum. This is demonstrated first by using a conventional DSSC architecture with a liquid electrolyte and performed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.2%, representing an improvement over cells based on each of the independent dyes. Next, we used Cs2SnI6 as an encapsulating layer over the sensitizing molecules to reduce charge leakage across the dye layers and also added to the absorption of longer wavelengths up to one micron. Finally, we fabricated a cell utilizing a Cs2SnI6/succinonitrile solid hole-transport electrolyte and achieved a PCE of similar to 8.5%. It is expected that the all solid-state design will go a long way toward improving long-term device stability.	[Lee, Byunghong; Lee, Woongkyu; Marks, Tobin J.; Chang, Robert P.

Reaction-Transport Coupling in a Nanostructured Porous Electrode	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							SENSITIZED SOLAR-CELLS; RECOMBINATION LOSSES; CHARGE-TRANSFER; TIO2 FILMS; KINETICS; IODIDE; ADSORPTION; PLATINUM	The function of nanoporous electrodes involves chemical reactions coupled to transport of reactants and products into and out of the solid matrix. To understand how this coupling can depend on electrode structure and chemistry, a general multiscale, molecular-level computational framework is introduced and applied to a model system containing a nanoporous photoanode, the dye-sensitized solar cell. The pore structure and electrolyte composition are systematically varied to probe this coupling, revealing that in most cases the photocurrent density depends on dye coverage within the anode matrix, the specific architecture of an individual pore, and electrolyte gradients in between the anode and cathode. The large electrolyte gradients that develop in the anode are not kinetically controlling. The computational framework demonstrated is general and can be applied to other electrochemical, photochemical, and thermally driven nanoporous systems to evaluate the fundamental characteristics of their function.

Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a versatile energy carrier and can be produced by reduction of O-2 on a dye-sensitized photocathode, in which the design of dye molecules is crucial for the conversion efficiency and electrode stability. Herein, using a hydrophobic donor-double-acceptor dye (denoted as BH4) sensitized NiO photocathode, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) can be produced efficiently by reducing O-2 with current density up to 600 mu A cm(-2) under 1 sun conditions (Xe lamp as sunlight simulator, lambda > 400 nm). The DSPECs maintain currents greater than 200 mu A cm(-2) at low overpotential (0.42 V vs. RHE) for 18 h with no decrease in the rate of H2O2 production in aqueous electrolyte. Moreover, the BH4 sensitized NiO photocathode was for the first time applied in an aprotic electrolyte for oxygen reduction. In the absence of a proton source, the one-electron reduction of O-2 generates stable, nucleophilic superoxide radicals that can then be synthetically utilized in the attack of an available electrophile, such as benzoyl chloride. The corresponding photocurrent generated by this photoelectrosynthesis is up to 1.8 mA cm(-2). Transient absorption spectroscopy also proves that there is an effective electron transfer from reduced BH4 to O-2 with a rate constant of 1.8 x 10(6) s(-1). This work exhibits superior photocurrent in both aqueous and non-aqueous systems and reveals the oxygen/superoxide redox mediator mechanism in the aprotic chemical synthesis.

The interesting optical properties of CDOTs make it vital to explore its potential in the development of sustainable energy. In this work, one-step hydrothermally synthesized CDOTs were used as sensitizing agent in the fabrication of dye sensitized solar cell. The fabrication of the CDOT-based dye sensitized solar cell and its performance characteristics are explored in depth. The fabricated dye sensitized solar cell performance in terms of efficiency, voltage, and current was evaluated using a standard illumination of air-mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5 G) having an irradiance of 100 mW/cm [2]. The photon-to-current conversion efficiency (eta) of only the carbon dot sensitized solar cell was 0.10% whereas the efficiency of the solar cell fabricated with a sensitizing dye made up of CDOT and N719 was 0.19%. As compared with the performance DSSCs fabricated with only 719 dye, it was observed that when CDOT was used in combination with N719 as sensitizing dye, the open circuit voltage increases yet the overall efficiency of the resulting solar cells decreases. It is clear from the result that CDOT could be used as a sensitizing dye in DSSCs. However, it is not very useful when used in combination with other sensitizing dyes due to energy transfer.

Crossing the bridge from molecular catalysis to a heterogenous electrode in electrocatalytic water oxidation	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						electrocatalytic water oxidation; homogenous and heterogenous; silane surface functionalization; surface electropolymerization; grafting-through	RUTHENIUM(II) POLYPYRIDYL CHROMOPHORES; SINGLE-SITE; SILICA NANOPARTICLES; COMPLEXES; STABILIZATION; INSTABILITY; ASSEMBLIES; MECHANISM; EFFICIENT	Significant progress has been made in designing single-site molecular Ru(II)-polypyridyl-aqua catalysts for homogenous catalytic water oxidation. Surface binding and transfer of the catalytic reactivity onto conductive substrates provides a basis for heterogeneous applications in electrolytic cells and dye-sensitized photoelectrosynthesis cells (DSPECs). Earlier efforts have focused on phosphonic acid (-PO3H2) or carboxylic acid (-CO2H) bindings on oxide surfaces. However, issues remain with limited surface stabilities, especially in aqueous solutions at higher pH under conditions that favor water oxidation by reducing the thermodynamic barrier and accelerating the catalytic rate using atom-proton transfer (APT) pathways. Here, we address the problem by combining silane surface functionalization and surface reductive electropolymerization on mesoporous, nanofilms of indium tin oxide (ITO) on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates (FTO vertical bar nanoITO). FTO vertical bar nanoITO electrodes were functionalized with vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTMS) to introduce vinyl groups on the electrode surfaces by silane attachment, followed by surface electropolymerization of the vinyl-derivatized complex, [Ru-II(Mebimpy)(dvbpy)(OH2)](2+) (1(2+); Mebimpy: 2,6-bis(1-methyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)pyridine; dvbpy: 5,5'-divinyl-2,2'-bipyridine), in a mechanism dominated by a grafting-through method. The surface coverage of catalyst 1(2+) was controlled by the number of electropolymerization cycles. The combined silane attachment/cross-linked polymer network stabilized 1(2+) on the electrode surface under a variety of conditions especially at pH > similar to 6. Surface-grafted poly1(2+) was stable toward redox cycling at pH similar to 7.5 over an similar to 4-h period. Sustained heterogeneous electrocatalytic water oxidation by the electrode gave steady-state currents for at least similar to 6 h with a Faradaic efficiency of similar to 68% for O-2 production.

Silica particles with unique porous structures not only increase the roughness of the coating, but also enhance the transmittance of the glass. The coated glass has displayed a large transmittance of 99% at wavelength of 580 nm, an absolute transmittance increase by 6% or more in the wavelength range of 480-900 nm, and an excellent hydrophobicity with a water contact angle (WCA) of 147 degrees and a sliding angle < 10 degrees. As a result, this coating effectively improves the short-circuit current density from 13.27 to 14.17 mA/cm(2) and the conversion efficiency from 6.03 to 6.64% for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), with a 10.12% improvement. This work thus has shown a promising approach to enhance the performance of solar cells with broadband antireflective coating surfaces. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Tkaczibson, K; Ardo, S				Tkaczibson, Kevin; Ardo, Shane			Numerical Monte Carlo simulations of charge transport across the surface of dye and cocatalyst modified spherical nanoparticles under conditions of pulsed or continuous illumination	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS			English	Article							SELF-EXCHANGE REACTIONS; INTERMOLECULAR HOLE TRANSFER; HYDROGEN GENERATION; ELECTRON-DIFFUSION; WATER OXIDATION; ENERGY-TRANSFER; SOLAR; TIO2; RECOMBINATION; CONVERSION	Solar fuel constructs consisting of discrete light-absorbers and distinct redox-active electrocatalysts are well suited for numerical modeling of their charge-transfer processes. Herein by several series of Monte Carlo simulations employing spherical nanoparticle molecular supports, we identify conditions that result in the largest yield for forming specific redox states of electrocatalysts. In general, the yield for electrocatalyst oxidation/reduction increased as the self-exchange electron-transfer time constant decreased and/or the recombination time constant increased. When the number of electrocatalysts increased to more than one per nanoparticle, yields for oxidation/reduction of electrocatalysts decreased because oxidative/reductive equivalents were diluted among the larger number of electrocatalysts. As the light intensity increased the yield for oxidation/reduction of electrocatalysts increased both in absolute number and yield per absorbed photon. However, at extreme photon fluences the yield per absorbed photon decreased due to significantly faster recombination which is clear from the equal-concentration second-order nature of the recombination reaction in the number of oxidized/reduced molecules per nanoparticle. Results obtained using electrocatalysts that only required a single oxidation/reduction event for turnover were within error the same irrespective of whether optical excitation was simulated to occur as an initial pulse, to mimic pulsed-laser spectroscopic measurements, or with repeated photoexcitation events, to mimic conditions of solar illumination. However, when electrocatalysts required multiple oxidations/reductions for turnover the intensity of pulsed light required to obtain the same electrocatalyst turnover yield that was observed using repeated photoexcitation depended greatly on the electron-transfer time constants. In addition, at solar-relevant fluences the equal-concentration second-order kinetic process for recombination exhibited a firstorder dependence on the number of nanoparticles that contained an oxidized/reduced molecule. The rate of electrocatalyst turnover after two redox events was also determined to have a first-order dependence on the concentration of oxidized/reduced molecules over most of the time that oxidized/reduced molecules were present. Collectively the solar-simulated data showed that even under the assumption of ideal kinetic processes and molecular and semiconductor densities of states, the observed kinetic behavior can be complex and change as a function of time and fluence. These observations suggest that results from pulsed-laser spectroscopic measurements are not always accurate predictors of the expected behavior of sunlight-illuminated dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells that drive multiple-charge-transfer reactions.

Consequently, without the aid of rigorous equipments and polyelectrolytes, the functionalized grapheme with opposite charge can be directly assembled to form graphene thin films in an aqueous environment, then the cobalt cation and sulfur anion adsorb on the graphene film to form cobalt sulfide nanoparticle. Due to the good dispersion of CoS nanoparticle, which is facilitated by functional groups on graphene, the DSSC with CFG electrode generates comparable power conversion efficiency (5.37%) to that of the Pt electrode (5.68%).

They were subjected to photophysical, electrochemical and theoretical studies. The dyes exhibited characteristic lambda(abs) and lambda(emi) in the range of 445-485 and 545-570 nm, respectively. Both optical and electrochemical band gaps were found to be in the range of 2.2 to 2.35 eV. The driving forces for injection (Delta G(inj)), recombination (Delta G(rec)) and regeneration (Delta G(reg)) processes were evaluated to understand their feasibility. Finally, the DSSC devices were fabricated employing the new dyes as sensitizers as well as co-sensitizers along with the Ru(ii) based N3 dye. Interestingly, DTP carrying 4-aminobenzoic acid as the anchoring group shows the best photoelectrochemical performance, viz. photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) = 4.4%, open circuit potential (V-OC) = 0.577 V, and short-circuit current density (J(SC)) = 9.06 mA cm(-2) with a broad incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum. Co-sensitization of the dyes brought about enhanced V-OC values, compared to the N3 dye alone. Finally, different interface resistance values obtained from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) circuit fitting were used to study the fundamental processes of energy conversion.

Self-Assembled Bilayers as an Anchoring Strategy: Catalysts, Chromophores, and Chromophore-Catalyst Assemblies	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							COUPLED ELECTRON-TRANSFER; WATER OXIDATION; OXIDE; MONOLAYERS; RUTHENIUM; ELECTROPOLYMERIZATION; COMPLEXES; MECHANISM; KINETICS	Anchoring strategies for immobilization of molecular catalysts, chromophores, and chromophore-catalyst assemblies on electrode surfaces play an important role in solar energy conversion devices such as dye sensitized solar cells and dye-sensitized photoelectrosynthesis cells. They are also important in interfacial studies with surface-bound molecules including electron-transfer dynamics and mechanistic studies related to small molecule activation catalysis. Significant progress has been made in this area, but many challenges remain in terms of stability, synthetic complexity, and versatility. We report here a new anchoring strategy based on self assembled bilayers. This strategy takes advantage of noncovalent interactions between long alkyl chains chemically bound to a metal-oxide electrode surface and long alkyl chains on the molecule being anchored. The new methodology is applicable to the heterogenization of both catalysts and chromophores as well as to the in situ "synthesis" of chromophore-catalyst assemblies on the electrode surface.

Low-temperature titania-graphene quantum dots paste for flexible dye-sensitised solar cell applications	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Graphene quantum dots; Binder free TiO2 paste; Polymer substrate; DSSC	LIGHT-EMITTING-DIODES; THIN-FILM; PHOTOLUMINESCENCE; FABRICATION; GRAPHITE; HYBRID; DISPERSIONS; PHOTOANODE; DEPENDENCE; EFFICIENCY	Graphene possesses excellent mechanical strength and chemical inertness with high intrinsic carrier mobility and superior flexibility making them exceptional candidates for optoelectronic applications. Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) derived from graphene domains have been widely explored to study their photoluminescence properties which can be tuned by size. GQDs are biocompatible, low cytotoxic, strongly luminescent and disperse well in polar and non-polar solvents showing bright promise for the integration into devices for bioimaging, light emitting and photovoltaic applications. In the present study, graphene quantum dots were synthesized by an electrochemical cyclic voltammetry technique using reduced graphene oxide (rGO). GQDs have been incorporated into binder free TiO2 paste and studied as a photoelectrode material fabricated on ITO/PEN substrates for flexible dye sensitised solar cells (DSSCs). DSSC based on GQDs-TiO2 exhibited open circuit output potential difference (V-oc) of 0.73 V, and short circuit current density (J(sc)) of 11.54 mA cm(-2) with an increment in power conversion efficiency by 5.48%, when compared with those with DSSC build with just a TiO2 photoanode (open-circuit output potential difference (V-oc) of 0.68 V and short circuit density (J(sc)) of 10.67 mA cm(-2)). The results have been understood in terms of increased charge extraction and reduced recombination losses upon GQDs incorporation. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Near-Infrared-Absorbing Indolizine-Porphyrin Push-Pull Dye for Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						porphyrin; NIR dyes; dye-sensitized solar cells; proaromatic; aggregate analysis	ACCEPTOR ORGANIC-DYES; MOLECULAR DESIGN; DONOR; EFFICIENCY; OPTIMIZATION; PERFORMANCE	Porphyrins are attractive chromophores for application in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), as judicious tuning of donor-acceptor properties can enable excellent near-infrared (NIR) absorption and exceptional device performance. Here, we report a porphyrin-based dye (SM85) conjugated to the planar strong electron donor, indolizine, designed to extend absorption further into the NIR region by inducing pi-pi interactions such as head-to-tail dye aggregation. The optoelectronic consequences of indolizine incorporation in SM85 include raising the ground-state oxidation potential and broadening and red-shifting ultraviolet-visible-NIR absorptions, along with increased molar absorptivity when compared to the dye SM315. Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations confirm the push-pull character of SM85, which features an overlap of frontier occupied and unoccupied orbitals. Steady-state spectrophotometric analyses reveal the presence of solution aggregates via absorption and emission spectroscopies. Aggregate modes were probed by DFT and TD-DFT analyses, and plausible models are presented. SM85-based DSC devices demonstrate a 5.7% power conversion efficiency (PCE) at full sun (7.4% PCE at 10% sun) with an exceptional improvement to the incident photon-to-current conversion onset at similar to 850 nm. Current dynamics measurements, time-correlated single photon counting, and computational analyses are used to better understand device performances. This study puts forward a novel intramolecular charge-transfer porphyrin system with a dramatic shift into the NIR region, as is needed for nonprecious metal-based sensitizers, and provides an example of controlled, donor-acceptor-mediated aggregation as a complementary strategy to traditional donor-acceptor modifications to single-molecule pi-systems in accessing enhancements in long wavelength light harvesting in molecular-based optoelectronic devices.

Dibenzoporphyrin YH7 displayed strong push-pull characteristics, which included clearly segregated HOMO/LUMO and fast charge injection from the singlet excited state of zinc porphyrin to the conduction band of TiO2. The incorporation of both the phenylethynyl bridge and amino group was critical to achieve the enhanced push-pull effect. The highest PCE value in this series obtained with the YH6 cell was 6.7%, which is comparable to that of the best ruthenium dye, N719 (eta = 7.4%), under similar conditions. The high PCE of the YH6 cell is ascribed to its high light harvesting ability and favorable cell kinetics, which is supported by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies and femtosecond transient absorption studies. An unusual illumination-induced photodegradation was observed for YH7, which was attributed as the major reason for the unexpected lower PCE of the YH7 cell (eta = 5.7%). This work demonstrates the applicability of pi-extended porphyrins as a new generation of sensitizers for high performance dye-sensitized solar cells.

Theoretical (DFT and TDDFT) insights into the effect of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons on Monascus pigments and its implication as a photosensitizer for dye-sensitized solar cells	MICROELECTRONIC ENGINEERING			English	Article						Monascus pigments; DFT; Energy gap; Photovoltaic; Solar cell	ORGANIC-DYES; EFFICIENCY; DERIVATIVES; INHIBITORS; DESIGN; LIPASE	Monascus pigments (MPs) as natural food pigments which have been extensively used in food industries, specifically in China, Japan, and other countries of southeastern Asian. The optoelectronic properties of the MPs with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) units have been investigated by using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent (TDDFT) at B3LYP and the 6-31G(d) basis set. These properties include total energies, Fermi energy, work function, orbital distributions (HOMO, LUMO), the HOMO-LUMO gap, the maximum open circuit voltage, maximum wavelength absorption, electronic transition energies, and the oscillator strengths. These methods and calculation procedures not only encourage a profound understanding of the association between the optoelectronic properties and chemical structures of the molecules but also can be utilized to design new molecule structures. We investigated the influence of the PAHs into the MPs and studied the optoelectronic properties on all molecules. The results showed that the maximum absorption wavelengths for MPs-PAHs are within the visible light region. Therefore, these molecules provide good performance for the photovoltaic devices and solar cells applications. Significance: Our results showed that the total energy increase after addition of PAHs for MPs, this illustration that the molecules converted to more stability. The addition of PAHs can enhance HOMO, LUMO level which can upsurge reduce bandgap energy and also the faculty of electron injection. Where the bandgap energy lies in the range (2.242-3.012) eV. The lambda max takes the values from 378.84 nm to 681.03 nm, where the lowest value for Ms. (S3) and highest for the Ms. (S1), where Ms. (S1) represents firsa t singlet excited state that is at about 681.03 nm but with a feeble absorption.

These dyes need to meet several criteria to be effective for this purpose, including air stability, and an ability to be regenerated by common electrolytes. Both of these properties are related to the Fe(III/ II) reduction potentials. Here we show how the Fe(III/II) reduction potentials of Fe(II) complexes can be estimated from a single experimental Fe(III/II) reduction potential and computationally cheap calculations on single isolated ligands. This method requires refinement, but could prove highly useful for large-scale computational screening and design of Fe(II) dyes.

The structures are furnished with anchoring groups of ethyl ester (8a, 8b, and 8c) or carboxylic acid (9c) on the indolenine moiety and hexyloxy (8b) or neopentyloxy (8c, 9c) groups on the DBTAA moiety. The best performance was exhibited by dye 9c, which under constant AM 1.5G solar simulation (100 mW cm(-2)) using I-/I-3(-) electrolyte gave a short-circuit current J(sc) = 0.43 mA cm(-2), an open-circuit voltage V-oc = 0.41 V and a fill factor FF = 0.528, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency of eta = 0.093%.

The Role of Antireflective Coating CYTOP, Immersion Oil, and Sensitizer Selection in Fabricating a 2.3 V, 10% Power Conversion Efficiency SSM-DSC Device	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						antireflective coatings; dye-sensitized solar cells; high voltage solar cells; multijunction solar cells; SSM-DSCs	SOLAR-CELLS; ORGANIC-DYES; PEROVSKITE; PHOTOVOLTAICS; REDUCTION; ENERGY	Sequential series multijunction dye-sensitized solar cells (SSM-DSCs) can power solar-to-fuel processes with a single illuminated area device. Dye selection and strategies limiting photon losses are critical in SSM-DSC devices for higher performance systems. Herein, an efficient and readily applicable spin coating protocol on glass surfaces with an antireflective fluoropolymer (CYTOP) is applied to an SSM-DSC architecture. Combining CYTOP with the use of an immersion oil between glass spacers in a three subcell SSM-DSC with judiciously selected TiO2 photoanode sensitizers and thicknesses, an overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.1% is obtained with an output of 2.3 V. Without external bias, this SSM-DSC configuration shows an impressive overall solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency of 6% when powering IrO2 and Au2O3 electrocatalysts for CO2 and H2O to CO and H-2 conversion in aqueous solution. The role of CYTOP, immersion oil, sensitizer selection, and film thickness on SSM-DSC devices is discussed along with the stability of this system.

Dual morphology titanium dioxide for dye sensitized solar cells	CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Dual morphology; Screen printing; 2D correlation; Phonon confinement; Dye sensitized solar cell	ENERGY-CONVERSION EFFICIENCY; REACTION TEMPERATURE; PHONON-CONFINEMENT; TIO2 NANOPARTICLES; SCATTERING LAYER; PERFORMANCE; PHOTOANODE; COMPOSITE; SIZE; SPHERES	Anatase TiO2 displaying dual morphologies were synthesized with a simple chemical route via a single step. A strong correlation between the dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) device performance and the obtained dual morphologies are highlighted using relevant evidences from UV vis and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), Raman analysis, field emission scanning electron microscope, high resolution transmission electron microscope, current-voltage characteristics and impedance analysis. Structural investigation revealed that the interested medium in this work employed for the synthesis of TiO2 produced different types of dual morphologies such as nanospheres with nanoparticles (NSNP), microsphere decorated with nanoparticles (mu SNP) and nanoparticles with stone like features (NPS). UV vis and DRS results indicated the ability of the materials to assist with diffused reflectance and optical absorption of the screen printed photoanodes. In addition, an investigation of Raman vibrational characteristics was carried out in detail using synchronous and asynchronous 2D correlation analysis. The high intense Eg anatase mode of Raman spectrum was simulated using a phonon confinement model and its normalized spectra are compared with an experimental data. The resultant performances in the DSSCs were not indicative by the material properties; so, the charge transfer resistance (R-ct) and recombination properties of the photoanode were investigated. These results showed that the Nyquist plot of NSNP possesses the smallest diameter, which reveals that the device based on NSNP offers the lowest R-ct value that accounts for the higher conversion efficiencies when compared with the DSSC device based on photoanodes mu SNP and NSP. It can be concluded that the improved power conversion efficiency shown by photoanode fabricated using NSNP has the dual role of optimum surface area for dye loading and light scattering centres. These properties, when optimized along with the offered pathway for electrolyte diffusion to the dye degeneration with less R, could lead to better photoelectric conversion efficiency.

Oxide semiconductors generally have a E-FB shift of -59 mV in aqueous solutions when the pH is increased by 1 unit as a consequence of surface deprotonation. Many of the most desirable redox reactions, such as the reduction of CO2 to HCOOH, or water to H-2, also show the same dependence on pH due to the involvement of protons. Therefore, pH cannot be used to tune the relative energy alignment between the electrode and the electrolytes. Here, we demonstrate via Mott-Schottky measurement that sensitized NiO with a membrane-inspired design of dye molecule (BH4) can decouple the pH dependence of E-FB. The E-FB of BH4-sensitized NiO films shows very little to zero change as a function of pH, whereas (P1)-sensitized NiO and the bare NiO follow the Nernst shift with respect to pH.

Two different adsorption schemes were proposed to account for p-ER interactions with TiO2 under different solvent environments. In aprotic solvents, p-ER adsorbs directly onto TiO2. Conversely, in protic solvents, in which solvent molecules bind stronger than p-ER with TiO2, the dye molecules adsorb onto the solvent shell around the particle but not directly to the TiO2 surface. In addition, a portion of the p-ER molecules form hydrogen bonds with the protic solvent molecules. The two different adsorption models reproduce the adsorption isotherms detected by SHS. Specifically, the p-ER molecules adsorb with a smaller free energy change and a larger density in protic solvents than in aprotic solvents. Our results indicate that protic solvents are undesirable for administering adsorption of carboxylic dyes in dye-sensitized solar cell applications as the dye molecules do not directly adsorb onto the TiO2 particle.

UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy revealed red-shifted and broadened absorption spectra of A2B2 tetrabenzoporphyrin as compared with its A2 dibenzo- and A2B2 dibenzoporphyrin analogues, which is a desired feature of dyes for dye-sensitized solar cells. DFT calculations also indicate favorable electron density distribution on the HOMO and LUMO of KW-4. However, the power conversion efficiency of the solar cell based on tetrabenzoporphyrin KW-4 displayed inferior performance than that of the solar cell based on A2 dibenzoporphyrin KW-2. The lower performance of the KW-4 cell was ascribed to two factors: the low lying LUMO energy level leading to less efficient electron injection and the "flat geometry" of the dye on TiO2 surface facilitating charge recombination and decreasing dye loading. The investigation of anchoring group effect suggests that the acrylic acid group is a better anchoring group than pentadienyl carboxylic acid.

This supramolecular dyad design is an alternative method to replace the most challenging synthesis of covalent-linked dyads. Metal-coordinated-based dyad complex improved the light-harvesting properties of the photoanodes as opposed to when individual dye anchored on TiO2 surface alone. DSSCs comprise of RuPcPyPMI dyad convert light-to-electrical energy more efficiently (=2.29%) than those made of single dye under one sun irradiation (100mWcm(-2)) condition. The enhanced photovoltaic performance of the dyad-based devices is due to the broader light absorption of the dyad in the longer wavelengths, enabling better electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2. The combined effect of efficient electron-hole charge separation and the long-lived charge-separated states facilitated the higher short-circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the devices. The enhancement of Voc and Jsc of the devices is confirmed by measuring current-voltage (I-V) curve and incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum of each device.

All the prepared fibrous membranes were soaked in an optimized electrolytes [0.1M of each LiI/NaI/KI/TBAI + 0.6M BMII + 0.05M I-2 + 0.5M of tert-butyl pyridine + (acetonitrile: (EC: PC) (1:1v/v)) (60:40)] solutions to obtain esPFM and esNCPFMs electrolytes and were characterized using differential scanning calorimetric (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and scanning electron microscope (SEM) techniques. Also, an electrolyte uptake behavior and ionic conductivity of all the prepared esPFM and esNCPFMs electrolytes samples were studied, respectively, using the calculated electrolyte uptake data and the resistance evaluated from the analysis of measured impedance data of each sample. The electrospun nanocomposite polymer (PVDF-HFP + 6 wt% TiO2 nanofibers fillers) fibrous membrane electrolyte with LiI showed highest conductivity of 1.87 x 10(-2) S/cm at room temperature, which was very good, compared to the liquid electrolyte systems. Transference number studies showed that the charge transport in the highest conducting 6 wt% of TiO2 nanofibers fillers of the esNCPFM sample with LiI is predominantly due to ions and has negligible electronic contribution. Hence, the newly developed high ionic conducting electrospun nanocomposite polymer (PVDF-HFP + 6 wt% TiO2 nanofibers fillers) fibrous membrane with LiI can be a better electrolyte for developing high-efficiency dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) application.

Unique morphology regulatory effect of NH4+ ions on one-dimensional TiO2 nanorod arrays (TNAs) is proved in this research for the first time, but nitrogen-doping effect is hardly detected. Once NH4Cl is added, the growth of TNAs is greatly promoted especially in radial direction, but little amount of nitrogen from NH4+ ions can enter the modified TNAs (N-TNAs). Furthermore, the bandgap energy of N-TNAs is almost unchanged compared with TNAs, meaning that trace nitrogen doping does not affect response ability to irradiation. When fabricated into dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with N-TNAs, the optimal photoelectrical conversion efficiency (3.16%) is nearly twice that with TNAs (1.62%). It is worth noting that the increased efficiency mainly results from the photoinduced current but not voltage. Second, the change of conversion efficiency is related to nanorod length. In summary, the improvement of photoelectrical property is caused by the directional growth of nanorods, which results from the addition of NH4+ ions as an effective structure regulatory agent.

High efficiency dye-sensitized solar cell based on a novel gel polymer electrolyte containing RbI and tetrahexylammonium iodide (Hex(4)NI) salts and multi-layered photoelectrodes of TiO2 nanoparticles	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS			English	Article						Dye sensitized solar cells; TiO2 nanoparticles; P25; Spin coating; Multilayer DSSC; Binary salt; RbI and Tetrahexylammonium Iodide	PHOTOVOLTAIC PERFORMANCE; CATION SIZE; ENHANCEMENT; TEMPERATURE; PHOTOANODE; STABILITY; NANOTUBES; INSIGHTS	High efficiency dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been achieved using a novel polymer gel electrolyte containing RbI and tetrahexylammonium iodide (Hex(4)NI) binary salts in combination with multi-layered TiO2 photoelectrodes. Performance enhancers were incorporated to the electrolyte to improve the efficiency in the DSSCs. Varying the salt mass fraction, showed that the conductivity in the electrolyte increases with increasing amount of RbI. The highest ionic conductivity of 4.19 mS cm(-1) is exhibited by the electrolyte sample with RbI: Hex(4)NI weight ratio of 3:1 at 25 degrees C. The temperature dependence of the electrolytes shows Arrhenius behavior. It is found that the electrolyte with RbI: Hex(4)NI weight ratio of 1.06:1 is more suitable for DSSC's applications and it has a conductivity of 3.77 mS cm(-1). A colloidal suspension of P25 TiO2 nanoparticles was used to make the spin coated photo-anodes in the form of stacks of 1-6 layers. The formation of a highly uniform and porous structure is observed with increasing number of layers from scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction studies revealed that the layers are predominantly anatase phase with crystallite size of 19-22 nm. The band gap was estimated to be around 3.22 eV based on UV-Visible spectroscopy and found to be decreasing slightly with increasing layer thickness. The maximum efficiency of 7.5% and an impressively high current density of 20 mA cm(-2) were observed for the 4-layer device with the new gel electrolyte based on RbI and Hex(4)NI. This study not only brings reliability and consistency to the ways of preparing well-ordered TiO2 photoanodes but also offers the possibility of low-cost practical and highly efficient quasi-solid state DSSCs.

To rationally design and accelerate the search for the highly efficient catalysts, it is necessary to establish design principles for the carbon-based catalysts. Here, theoretical analysis and material design of metal-free carbon nanomaterials as efficient photo-/electrocatalysts to facilitate the critical chemical reactions in clean and sustainable energy technologies are reviewed. These reactions include the oxygen reduction reaction in fuel cells, the oxygen evolution reaction in metal-air batteries, the iodine reduction reaction in dye-sensitized solar cells, the hydrogen evolution reaction in water splitting, and the carbon dioxide reduction in artificial photosynthesis. Basic catalytic principles, computationally guided design approaches and intrinsic descriptors, catalytic material design strategies, and future directions are discussed for the rational design and synthesis of highly efficient carbon-based catalysts for clean energy technologies.

Stabilization of Ruthenium(II) Polypyridyl Chromophores on Mesoporous TiO2 Electrodes: Surface Reductive Electropolymerization and Silane Chemistry	ACS CENTRAL SCIENCE			English	Article							SENSITIZED SOLAR-CELLS; WATER-OXIDATION; SILICA NANOPARTICLES; CATALYST ASSEMBLIES; COMPLEXES; DYE; POLYMERIZATION; FILMS; PHOTOANODES; CHALLENGES	Stabilization is a critical issue in the long term operation of dye-sensitized photoelectrosynthesis cells (DSPECs) for water splitting or CO2 reduction. The cells require a stable binding of the robust molecular chromophores, catalysts, and chromophore/catalyst assemblies on metal oxide semiconductor electrodes under the corresponding (photoelectro)chemical conditions. Here, an efficient stabilization strategy is presented based on functionalization of FTO vertical bar nanoTiO(2) (mesoporous, nanostructured TiO2 deposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass) electrodes with a vinylsilane followed by surface reductive electropolymerization of a vinyl-derivatized Ru(II) polypyridyl chromophore. The surface electropolymerization was dominated by a grafting-through mechanism, and rapidly completed within minutes. Chromophore surface coverages were controlled up to three equivalent monolayers by the number of electropolymerization cycles. The silane immobilization and cross-linked polymer network produced highly (photo) stabilized chromophore-grafted FTO vertical bar nanoTiO(2) electrodes. The electrodes showed significant improvements over structures based on atomic layer deposition and polymer dip-coating stabilization methods in a wide pH range from pH approximate to 1 to pH approximate to 12.5 under both dark and light conditions. Under illumination, with hydroquinone added as a sacrificial electron transfer donor, a photoresponse for sustained electron transfer mediation occurred for at least similar to 20 h in a pH approximate to 7.5 phosphate buffer (0.1 M NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, with 0.5 M NaClO4). The overall procedure provides an efficient way to fabricate highly stabilized molecular assemblies on electrode surfaces with potential applications for DSPECs in solar fuels.

Direct conversion of Na5 into K2 was accomplished with (CH3)(3)SiCN and (CH3)(3)SiCl as a catalyst in an autoclave. Alternatively, Na5 is converted into Na[BH{OC(O)R}(3)] (R=alkyl) that is more reactive towards (CH3)(3)SiCN and thus provides an easy access to salts of 2. Some reaction intermediates were identified, for example, Na[BH(CN){OC(O)Et}(2)] (Na7 b) and Na[BH(CN)(2){OC(O)Et}] (Na8 b). A third entry to 2 and 3 uses ether adducts of BHCl2 or BH2Cl such as the commercial 1,4-dioxane adducts that react with KCN and (CH3)(3)SiCN. Alkali metal salts of 2 and 3 are convenient starting materials for organic salts, especially for low viscosity ionic liquids (ILs). [EMIm]3 has the lowest viscosity and highest conductivity with 10.2 mPa s and 32.6 mS cm(-1) at 20 degrees C known for non-protic ILs. The ILs are thermally, chemically, and electrochemically robust. These properties are crucial for applications in electrochemical devices, for example, dye-sensitized solar cells (Gratzel cells).

Nearly monodispersed Ag2Se nanocrystals with a bandgap of 1.62 eV (similar to 765 nm) were synthesized via a one-pot process, and Ag2Se CEs were fabricated by using a spin-coating and annealing process. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency and photocurrent spectra indicated that Ag2Se CEs can generate the electricity by harvesting more visible light, which could not be absorbed by dye-sensitized photoanodes. Thus, compared to Pt CE (7.57 %), the DSSC based on Ag2Se CE exerted a higher PCE of 8.06 %. The development of photovoltaic CEs may offer an alternative way to promote the performance and competitiveness of DSSCs.

Stable Molecular Photocathode for Solar-Driven CO2 Reduction in Aqueous Solutions	ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							WATER OXIDATION; PHOTOELECTROCHEMICAL REDUCTION; CARBON-DIOXIDE; CATALYST; DYE; OXIDE; COMPLEX; STABILIZATION; ASSEMBLIES; TIO2	The performance of dye-sensitized photoelectrodes for artificial photosynthesis is typically limited by instability in aqueous solutions. We describe here a new molecular-based photocathode that integrates functional chromophore-catalyst assemblies for long-term solar-driven CO2 reduction in stabilized polymeric film structures. The assemblies include a silane surface-anchoring bridge, a ruthenium polypyridyl chromophore, and a rhenium-based molecular catalyst. They were prepared on nano crystalline oxide films by silanization of the oxide and two-step electropolymerization of vinyl-derivatized precursors. The integrated photocathode was stable toward CO2 reduction for over 10 h with a Faradaic efficiency of similar to 65%. The long-term stability arises from the silane surface-anchoring groups and the carbon-carbon bonds formed by electropolymerization between the three components. Transient absorption measurements on a nano-to-microsecond time scale show that the assemblies undergo rapid hole injection into the oxide electrode followed by relatively slow interfacial charge recombination.

These sensitizers are comprised of a phenyl ring as a donor scaffold connected with a carboxylic group as acceptor/anchoring unit. To gauge their applicability as photosensitizers for DSSCs the photophysical, electrochemical, theoretical studies and charge transport characteristics were carried out. Interestingly, uses of S-2 and S-4 dyes as co-sensitizers with well-known MH-13 dye resulted in enhancing its photovoltaic properties from 8.217 to 8.79% and 8.48%, respectively. Furthermore, the photo-sensitizer S-3 individually shows better photovoltaic properties compared to S-1, S-2 and S-4, due to the fast photo-induced electron transfer from the phenyl ring to the nitro group. This fast electron transfer resulted from the overlapping between HOMO and LUMO levels on phenyl ring bearing nitro group. The results indicate that these simple and easy prepared Schiff bases moieties may be considered as promising and low-cost co-sensitizers for DSSCs.

Silver nanowire-based transparent electrode as FTO replacement for dye-sensitized solar cell	INTERNATIONAL NANO LETTERS			English	Article						Silver nanowire; Transparent electrode; Core-shell nanoparticles; Dye-sensitized solar cell	FABRICATION	In this paper, we present a novel usage of silver nanowire-based transparent electrode instead of fluorine-doped tin oxide for a ZnO-TiO2 core-shell dye-sensitized solar cell. The Ag nanowire-based transparent electrode was fabricated with a simple coating method at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. This method potentially helps to reduce the production cost of dye-sensitized solar cell significantly by eliminating vacuum deposition processes for transparent electrodes and also enables the usage of various flexible substrates as a glass alternative. The Ag nanowire-based electrode is characterized using scanning electron microscope, four-point probe, and UV-Vis methods. With the short-circuit current density, I-sc, of 4.3x10(-4)A/cm(2) and the open-circuit voltage, V-oc, of 0.63V, the performance of the dye-sensitized solar cell shows promising preliminary data for a low-temperature ZnO-TiO2 DSSC.

Titanium glycerolate and TiO2 powders were obtained in the glycerol medium for the first time with four different power densities (240 W, 480 W, 720 W, 960 W) of irradiation using a domestic microwave oven of 2.45 GHz, to understand the impact of power on morphology tuning. The structural and morphological features of the titanium glycerolate and TiO2 powders were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and Raman spectra analysis. The TiO2 was successfully used in the fabrication of photovoltaic devices and as a proof-of-concept binder free paste was prepared and successfully employed for photo-anode using screen printing on the fluorine-doped tin oxide substrate.

The luminescent Y2O3: Eu3+/C3N4 nanocomposites are not only a promising down-conversion luminescent material, but also it could be used to improve the efficiencies of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Especially, the morphology of Y2O3: Eu3+ has great influence on the performance of DSSCs. Compared with Y2O3: Eu3+ nanorods, the introduction of small Y2O3: Eu3+ particles into the cells is conducive to the improvement of cell efficiency. The efficiencies of TiO2-Y2O3: Eu3+-C3N4 composite cells were not only higher than those of pure TiO2 cells but also higher than those of TiO2-Y2O3: Eu3+ or TiO2-C3N4 composite cells, resulting in the enhancement of the average efficiency of the TiO2-Y2O3: Eu3+-C3N4 composite cell from 7.16% to 8.14%, with 14% improvement over the pure TiO2 cell. The enhancement of the efficiency can be attributed to the synergetic effect of small Y2O3: Eu3+ particles and C3N4.

Here, we introduce a new class of ethynyl-linked panchromatic dyads composed of dibenzophenazines coupled ortho and meta to tetrapyrroles with an anchoring group that can be grafted onto metal oxide surfaces. Quantum chemical calculations and photophysical measurements of the synthesized materials reveal that both of the dibenzophenazine dyads absorb broadly from 300 to 636 nm and exhibit absorption bands different from those of the constitu ent chromophore units. Moreover, the different points of attachment of dibenzophenazines to tetrapyrroles give different absorption profiles which computations suggest result from differences in the planarity of the two dyads. Applicability of the dyads in artificial photosynthesis systems was assessed by their incorporation and characterization of their performance in dye-sensitized solar cells.

Emerging Design Principles for Enhanced Solar Energy Utilization with Singlet Fission	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							MULTIPLE EXCITON GENERATION; CHARGE-TRANSFER STATES; PHOTON UP-CONVERSION; ELECTRON-TRANSFER; TRIPLET EXCITONS; THIN-FILMS; FLOW DYNAMICS; TETRACENE; PENTACENE; ACENE	Singlet fission (SF), the generation of two triplet excitons per the absorption of one photon, is a promising strategy for increasing the efficiency of solar cells beyond the theoretical Shockley-Queisser limit of 34%. Upon photon absorption by a SF molecule, the initially created singlet excited state (S-1) interacts with a neighboring chromophore and is first transformed into a triplet pair (TT), which can be subsequently separated into independent triplet excitons (2T(1)). These independent triplet excitons can be harvested through triplet charge extraction or triplet energy transfer to an acceptor. Research on SF systems has revealed rates and efficiencies of triplet formation and triplet pair decorrelation that are strongly dependent on interchromophore coupling, which is dictated by molecular structure and the resulting geometrical arrangement of chromophores adopted in covalent (e.g., dimers) and noncovalent (e.g., films and crystals) systems. Incorporation of SF materials into realistic device architectures introduces a host of new challenges to consider regarding the efficient extraction of triplets generated through SF. In this Feature Article, we review our work that has led to some degree of understanding and control of inter- and intramolecular SF rates placed in the context of solar energy harvesting architectures, including dye-sensitized solar cells, conjugated polymer films, and ligand-exchanged quantum dots. We emphasize the importance of understanding and manipulating interactions between SF molecules with each other and with the charge or energy collectors across an interface in order to strike a kinetic balance that leads to efficient utilization of triplet excitons.

The size of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles is about 3 nm, and the influence of CoFe2O4 on the electrochemical properties of graphene is studied. The CoFe2O4 nanoparticles anchored on graphene nanosheets can serve as spacers to prevent graphene aggregations and thereby provide efficient diffusion pathways and more active surface area for electrolyte molecules. Also, the CoFe2O4 nanoparticles with substantial catalytic activity accelerate the reduction of triiodide. Meanwhile the graphene improves charge transfer during the catalytic process. Compared with CoFe2O4, graphene, and Pt electrodes, the CoFe2O4/GN electrode displays higher catalytic activity because of its minimal charge transfer resistance. The DSSCs fabricated with CoFe2O4/GN demonstrate an improved photoelectric conversion efficiency of 9.04% in comparison to Pt electrodes (6.54%). This study suggests that CoFe2O4/GN can replace expensive Pt electrodes for large-scale fabrication of low cost and high efficiency DSSCs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These photocatalysts were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry, X-ray diffraction, and micro-Raman, Fourier-transform infrared, X-ray photoelectron, and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Under wLED irradiation, the prepared BiOCl/rGO photocatalysts exhibited excellent photodegradation activity toward RhB through chromophore cleavage mechanism and toward phenol in the presence of RhB with notable dye-sensitized effect. Through scavenging experiments, superoxide radicals were notably involved in RhB degradation. With the highest charge separation efficiency and lowest recombination rate, the photocatalytic activity of BiOCl/rGO reached a maximum rate constant of 0.1899 min(-1), 2.0 and 3.0 times higher than those of BiOCl/GO and BiOCl, respectively. In the stability study, only a slight loss (4.5%) in photodegradation was observed after BiOCl/rGO was used in five cycles of photodegradation runs. Compared with commonly used photocatalyst such as TiO2 (P25), BiOCl/rGO demonstrated superior photocatalytic activity and stability under wLED irradiation for various dyestuffs (rhodamine 6 G, methylene blue, and fast green FCF) in different environmental water samples (lake, pond, and sea water).

An array of optoelectronic properties of the isolated dye and dyes adsorbed on a TiO2 cluster that simulates the semiconductor were explored by density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT methods. Light absorption spectra, vertical dipole moment, shift of the conduction band of semiconductor, excited state lifetime, driving force of electron injection, photostability of the excited state, and exciton binding energy were computed. Our study showed that the presence of an internal acceptor such as pyrido[3,4-b]pyrazine (pyrazine) would influence greater the open circuit voltage (V-OC), compared to the benzothiadiazole moiety. Considering the balance between the V-OC and J(SC) (short circuit current) along with the all calculated characteristics, the IND3, INDS, and IND10 are the most suited among the designed dyes to be used as potential candidates for the photo-efficient DSSCs. The present study provides the results of rational molecular design followed by exploration of photophysical properties to be used as a valuable reference for the synthesis of photo-efficient dyes for DSSCs.

The DSSC efficiency is higher than that (7.96%) of a DSSC with a standard Pt counter electrode. Furthermore, it was found that the electrical conductivity of 3DMG played a critical role in the PSC, but the DSSC performance was dependent on both its surface area and electrical conductivity. This would provide a novel approach to synthesize ideal electrode materials for energy devices.

Design-to-Device Approach Affords Panchromatic Co-Sensitized Solar Cells	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						co-sensitization; data-mining; dye-sensitized solar cells; materials discovery; photovoltaic devices	ORGANIC SENSITIZERS; DYE; AGGREGATION	Data-driven materials discovery has become increasingly important in identifying materials that exhibit specific, desirable properties from a vast chemical search space. Synergic prediction and experimental validation are needed to accelerate scientific advances related to critical societal applications. A design-to-device study that uses high-throughput screens with algorithmic encodings of structure-property relationships is reported to identify new materials with panchromatic optical absorption, whose photovoltaic device applications are then experimentally verified. The data-mining methods source 9431 dye candidates, which are auto-generated from the literature using a custom text-mining tool. These candidates are sifted via a data-mining workflow that is tailored to identify optimal combinations of organic dyes that have complementary optical absorption properties such that they can harvest all available sunlight when acting as co-sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Six promising dye combinations are shortlisted for device testing, whereupon one dye combination yields co-sensitized DSSCs with power conversion efficiencies comparable to those of the high-performance, organometallic dye, N719. These results demonstrate how data-driven molecular engineering can accelerate materials discovery for panchromatic photovoltaic or other applications.

Although there is much research effort that uses existing "off-the-shelf' photosensitizers to optimize these processes, it is also important to continue to develop new and improved photosensitizers, which can also lead to advances in photovoltaic and photocatalysis applications. Moving beyond the ubiquitous ruthenium polypyridyl class of photosensitizers, recent research has shown that complexes of other transition metals can have improved attributes, in particular, with regard to photostability and excited-state redox properties. In this Perspective, we highlight recent advances in photosensitizer design. We begin with a tutorial on the important criteria for photosensitizer design, following which we describe recent advances and expected future directions that demonstrate the ability to use synthetic chemistry to optimize the excited-state attributes of photosensitizer molecules.

The photo-conversion efficiency of the DSSC fabricated with the electrospun pure and Cobalt-doped Zinc oxide nanofibers as photoanodes are found to be highest for 5 wt% Co-doped ZnO nanofibers. It has achieved an enhanced photocurrent density of 5.36 mA cm(-2), fill factor of 0.731 and power conversion efficiency of 2.97% under AM 1.5 illumination. The presence cobalt ions in the Zinc oxide nanofibers, obstructs the recombination of the excited electrons with the dye or the electrolyte and thereby enhance with higher efficiency than pure Zinc oxide (eta% = 1.63%).

Stable Molecular Surface Modification of Nanostructured, Mesoporous Metal Oxide Photoanodes by Silane and Click Chemistry	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						dye-sensitized; Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes; silane chemistry; click chemistry; stability; photostability; electrostability; photoanode; DSPECs	CHROMOPHORE-CATALYST ASSEMBLIES; ATOMIC LAYER DEPOSITION; WATER-OXIDATION; POLYPYRIDYL COMPLEXES; ANCHORING GROUPS; PHOSPHONIC ACID; SOLAR FUELS; DYE; STABILIZATION; TIO2	Binding functional molecules to nanostructured mesoporous metal oxide surfaces provides a way to derivatize metal oxide semiconductors for applications in dye-sensitized photoelectrosynthesis cells (DSPECs). The commonly used anchoring groups, phosphonates and carboxylates, are unstable as surface links to oxide surfaces at neutral and high pH, leading to rapid desorption of appended molecules. A synthetically versatile molecular attachment strategy based on initial surface modification with a silyl azide followed by click chemistry is described here. It has been used for the stable installation of surface-bound metal complexes. The resulting surfaces are highly stabilized toward complex loss with excellent thermal, photochemical, and electrochemical stabilities. The procedure involves binding 3-azidopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS) to nanostructured mesoporous TiO2 or tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) electrodes by silane attachment followed by azide-terminated, Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reactions with an alkyne-derivatized ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complex. The chromophore-modified electrodes display enhanced photochemical and electrochemical stabilities compared to phosphonate surface binding with extended photoelectrochemical oxidation of hydroquinone for more than similar to 6 h with no significant decay.

Light-driven water oxidation by a dye-sensitized photoanode with a chromophore/catalyst assembly on a mesoporous double-shell electrode	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							ATOMIC LAYER DEPOSITION; CHARGE RECOMBINATION; PHOTOELECTROCHEMICAL CELLS; NANOCRYSTALLINE TIO2; HIGHLY EFFICIENT; CATALYST; PHOTOCATHODES; REDUCTION; INJECTION; MECHANISM	A mesoporous atomic layer deposition (ALD) double-shell electrode, Al2O3 (insulating core)//ALD ZnO vertical bar ALD TiO2, on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting substrate was explored for a photoanode assembly, FTO//Al2O3 (insulating core)//ALD ZnO vertical bar ALD TiO2 vertical bar-chromophore-catalyst, for light-driven water oxidation. Photocurrent densities at photoanodes based on mesoporous ALD double-shell (ALD ZnO vertical bar ALD TiO2 vertical bar) and ALD single-shell (ALD ZnO vertical bar, ALD TiO2 vertical bar) electrodes were investigated for O-2 evaluation by a generator-collector dual working electrode configuration. The high photocurrent densities obtained based on the mesoporous ALD ZnO vertical bar ALD TiO2 photoanode for O-2 evolution arise from a significant barrier to back electron transfer (BET) by the optimized tunneling barrier in the structure with the built-in electric field at the ALD ZnO vertical bar ALD TiO2 interface. The charge recombination is thus largely decreased. In the films, BET following injection has been investigated through kinetic nanosecond transient absorption spectra, and the results of energy band analysis are used to derive insight into the internal electronic structure of the electrodes.

Firstly, NCs were synthesized via in-situ sol-gel route. The compositional dependent physicochemical properties of the powdered (TiO2)(1-x)(RGO)(x) NCs were studied by using various spectroscopic (XRD, Raman, FTIR, UV-Visible DRS, PL, XPS), microscopic (HR-TEM with SAED) and BET measurements. Thereafter, thin-films of NCs were prepared by using binder-free doctor-blade technique and these films were sensitized with Ru(II) sensitizers. Before fabrication, the anchoring and absorption properties of the sensitizers with NCs were also studied. Finally, the sandwich dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) of (TiO2)(1-x)(RGO)(x) with sensitizers were tested through I-V and IPCE measurements. Among the different (TiO2)(1-x)(RGO)(x) photoelectrodes, T-0.925@R-0.075 NCs-based devices reached the conversion efficiency (eta) up to 5.98% for N719 to that of 4.76% for N3 device; which was four times higher to that of bare TiO2 with N719 (1.35%) and N3 (1.12%) based DSSCs. The observed photovoltaic parameters of the devices were further supported with the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of the (TiO2)(1-x)(RGO)(x) NCs.

Platinum is commonly used as a co-catalyst in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution but it increases the cost and hence restricts the commercialization of this technology. Eosin Y (EY) is widely studied in dye-sensitized systems as it is not only low-cost and easily commercially available, but also exhibits excellent visible light absorption ability. Herein, we oxidized Ti3C2 MXene in water at 60 degrees C for different times, to form TiO2/Ti3C2 on amorphous carbon (AC) composites. The oxidized MXene was used as a photocatalyst in a dye-sensitized system for hydrogen evolution to replace noble metal co-catalysts such as Pt. The highest hydrogen production rate of 33.4 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) was achieved by the TiO2/ Ti3C2@AC-48h composite with the sensitization of 1 mM EY, which was 110 times higher than that of oxidized Ti3C2 without EY. This work shows the potential of 2D MXenes used in dye-sensitized photocatalysis for hydrogen evolution.

However, the charge transfer kinetics mediated by its surface state remains unclear. Here, the charge transfer mechanism of Cs2SnI6 is reported and the role of its surface state in the presence of a redox mediator is clarified. Specifically, charge transfer through the surface state of Cs2SnI6 and its subsequent surface state charging are demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry and Mott-Schottky measurements, respectively. Because it is expected that the surface state of Cs2SnI6 is capable of regenerating oxidized organic dyes, a Cs2SnI6-based regenerator is developed for a dye-sensitized solar cell composed of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/dyed mesoporous TiO2/regenerator/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/FTO. As expected, the performance of the Cs2SnI6-based regenerator is strongly dependent on the highest occupied molecular orbital of the dyes. Consequently, Cs2SnI6 shows efficient charge transfer with a thermodynamically favorable charge acceptor level, achieving a 79% enhancement in the photocurrent density (14.1 mA cm(-2)) compared with that of a conventional liquid electrolyte (7.9 mA cm(-2)). The results suggest that the surface state of Cs2SnI6 is the main charge transfer pathway in the presence of a redox mediator and should be considered in future designs of Cs2SnI6-based devices.

However, the use of rare metals such as Pt counter electrodes (CEs) is one of the major drawbacks of DSSC devices for broad real-life applications. In this regard, alternative materials to Pt CEs have been long sought for DSSCs employing both cobalt and iodine redox couples. Therefore, in this study, soft-templated tellurium-doped mesoporous carbons (Te-SMCs) were synthesized for the first time by the simple pyrolysis of PAN-b-PBA block copolymer in the presence of a tellurium precursor for replacing the Pt CE. To confirm the chemical composition and porosity, the as-prepared Te-SMC materials were evaluated by elemental analysis (XPS and EDS) and nitrogen sorption isotherms measurement. The as-prepared Te-SMC materials contained mainly mesopores and retained the three-dimensional hierarchical graphite-like structure with many defect sites. They displayed doping levels with nitrogen of 9.15 atom % and tellurium of 0.15 atom % and had a specific surface area of 540 m(2) g(-1). Therefore, these characteristics enabled the development of a high-performance CE in DSSCs with cobalt and iodine redox couples. As a result of its catalytic performance, Te-SMC exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic activity as well as a significantly improved electrochemical stability than those of Pt CE for both redox couples even after 1000 potential cycles. The results show that a maximum conversion efficiency of 11.64 and 9.67% could be achieved under one sun illumination (AM 1.5G) for SGT-021/Co(bpy)(3)(2+/3+)- and N719/I-/I-3(-)-based devices with Te-SMC CEs, and their power conversion efficiency is superior to the corresponding device with Pt CEs.

The comment was written to cover Dr. Ehrmann groups failed attempt in fabricating solar cells with ultra-low efficiency and unnecessarily targeted only selected groups like us and other authors listed in her references. We have decided to respond since the comment was not peer-reviewed by experts in the area and published as-it-is as we felt we should provide proper justification along with the supporting evidence.

Charge Transfer Dynamics in Aqueous Dye-Sensitized Photoelectrochemical Cells: Implications for Water Splitting Efficiency	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; RECOMBINATION DYNAMICS; TRANSPORT; COMPLEXES; CATALYST	Water-splitting dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells (WS-DSPECs) utilize molecular species for light-harvesting and water oxidation in order to store solar energy as hydrogen fuel. To engineer these devices for better performance, research has centered around suppressing charge recombination at the semiconductor-sensitizer interface and developing better catalysts for water oxidation. Yet it remains quantitatively unknown how much DSPECs can benefit from these improvements. We use a simplified photoanode process to model the charge transport dynamics in DSPECs under surface reaction-limiting conditions. By combining intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and numerical simulations, we explore in detail how electron transport and recombination rates as well as the sensitizer regeneration rate affect the steady-state photocurrent and the charge carrier concentration distribution. Numerical simulations confirm that fast electron diffusion in the semiconductor, a slow interfacial charge recombination rate, and rapid catalysis of water oxidation can improve the incident-photon-to-current-efficiency of DSPECs. The benefit, however, is largely compromised by the low charge injection efficiency, a problem that has not yet been fully appreciated. These simulations indicate that the best-known water oxidation catalysts are already adequate and that improvements in light harvesting and injection yields are the most important challenges for designing higher-performance WS-DSPECs.

This cluster was used as a model for cadmium-sulfur nanoparticles. Such nanoparticles are often used in conjunction with photosensitizers (for singlet oxygen generation or dye-sensitized solar cells), and hence, it is important to determine if cadmium-sulfur moieties physically quench and/or chemically react with singlet oxygen. We found that (Me4N)(2)[Cd-4(SPh)(10)] is indeed a very strong quencher of singlet oxygen with total rate constants for O-1(2) removal of (5.8 +/- 1.3) x 10(8) M-1 in acetonitrile and (1.2 +/- 0.5) X 10(8) M-1 s(-1) in CD3OD. Physical quenching predominates, but chemical reaction leading to decomposition of the cluster and formation of sulfinate is also significant, with a rate constant of (4.1 +/- 0.6) x 10(6) s(-1) in methanol. Commercially available cadmium-sulfur quantum dots ("lumidots") show similar singlet oxygen quenching rate constants, based on the molar concentration of the quantum dots.

Charge Transfer from Upconverting Nanocrystals to Semiconducting Electrodes: Optimizing Thermodynamic Outputs by Electronic Energy Transfer	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							PHOTON UP-CONVERSION; CDSE QUANTUM DOTS; SOLAR-CELL; WATER; PHOTOCATHODES; FLUORESCENCE; CATALYST; HYDROGEN; OXIDE; FUEL	Light-harvesting inorganic nanocrystals play an important role in emerging solar energy conversion and optoelectronic devices. We describe here a strategy for a new family of photoelectrodes with upconverting nanocrystal assemblies as the photosensitizer. The assemblies consist of oleic acid-capped cadmium selenide (CdSe) nanocrystals that coordinate directly onto a layer of surface-bound, carboxylic acid-derivatized anthracenes through displacement of the oleic acid capping ligands. Steady-state emission and transient absorption measurements show that the upconverting nano crystal assemblies, selectively excited by green light, generate singlet excitons that enable efficient charge injection into both the conduction band of TiO2 at the photoanode and the valence band of NiO at the photocathode. The singlet excitons form by sensitized triplet-triplet annihilation within the compact layer of anthracenes on the electrode surfaces. Density of state analysis reveals that the electronic coupling between the anthracene singlet excited states and the oxides provides a thermodynamic basis for light-induced charge transfer. The interplay between the excited-state populations at the surface-bound molecules and the assembled nanocrystals presents new design rules that can potentially overcome the limitations of previous dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells for catalytic applications.

Compared with the traditional annealing methods, the prepared vapor-thermal mesoporous TiO2 films (VTMTF) reduce the resistance of interfaces effectively, possess more homogeneous pore distribution and own less nanoparticles agglomeration. Subsequently, the photoanodes based on VTMTF could significantly decrease the interfaces resistance of the TiO2/dye/electrolyte. Owing to these, the dye-sensitized solar cells based on VTMTF showed an improved power conversion efficiency of 6.22%, compared with the traditional annealing porous TiO2 (3.89%).

Evidence of Radical Intermediate Generated in the Electrochemical Oxidation of Iodide	JOURNAL OF THE MEXICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						inner sphere; iodide oxidation; dye-sensitized solar cell; electron transfer; two electron oxidation	SENSITIZED SOLAR-CELLS; 2-ELECTRON TRANSFER; CYCLIC VOLTAMMETRY; ELECTRON; COMPLEXES; CHEMISTRY; MECHANISM; KINETICS	We present evidence of the generation of radical ion formation during the oxidation of iodide on a fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) electrode in acetonitrile. The cyclic voltammograms for the oxidation of iodide and triiodide on FTO are significantly different as in the case of the oxidation on Pt electrode. The distinct voltammetric behavior is assigned to kinetic differences on the FTO surface that require significant over potentials to drive the oxidation of iodide and triiodide. We propose that at the highly positive potentials the iodine radical intermediate, I-center dot, becomes thermodynamically stable at FTO. The radical nature of the intermediate was verified by the formation of radicals of the usual traps of 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) and 2,2,5,5 tetramethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (TMPO) when these were added to an electrolyzed solution. Irradiation of an iodine solution causes the homolytic cleavage of I-2 and yields the same radical intermediate with TMPO as in the electrolysis experiment Similar results were obtained from the electrolysis of bromide solutions upon addition of TMPO. Short term electrolysis (< 1 h) gives triiodide as a final product while long-term electrolysis (> 17 h) yields additional byproducts. Byproducts were determined to be organoiodines by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Overall, our results are consistent with iodine atoms reacting with the electrolyte during electrolysis at the FTO electrode and with a sequential two-electron transfer process.

JAI characteristics of gel electrolyte based DSCs were obtained by varying the scan rate from 0.01 to 0.1 V s(-1) and the direction from forward bias to reverse bias and reverse bias to forward bias. Three electrolytes were tested, two of them were 100% single salt electrolytes of KI and Hex(4)NI, and the other was a mixed salt electrolyte containing KI (75%) and Hex(4)NI (25%). DSC containing mixed salts electrolyte exhibited higher efficiency than single salt electrolytes. The energy conversion efficiency with mixed salts increased from 5.9 to 6.4% with the increase of the scan rate from 0.01 to 0.1 V s(-1), when the scanning was conducted from forward bias to reverse bias direction. However, when the scanning was carried out with revised polarity a drop of the efficiency was observed with increasing rate of potential scan. Present work emphasizes the importance of reporting the rate and direction of potential scan along with solar cell performance parameters.	[Bandara, T. M. W.

DSSCs are built from a photoelectrode (a dye-sensitized nanocrystalline semiconductor), an electrolyte with redox couples, and a counterelectrode. In this review article, we outline the strategies to enhance the efficiency and reduce the cost by introducing graphene into the DSSCs as the photoelectrode. First, the development of DSSCs and the properties of graphene are briefly described.

Despite of high water content up to 60 vol% in organic solvent-based liquid electrolyte, the photovoltaic properties and long-term stability measured under the standard global (G) air-mass (AM) 1.5 solar irradiation were not significantly affected. The underlying correlation between the effects of water and the photovoltaic performances were identified by UV-visible spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. We investigated the long-term stability of performance for DSSCs in conjunction with I-/I-3(-) redox electrolytes in different water compositions. The findings revealed that the competitive photovoltaic performance and long-term stability of water-containing DSSCs mainly depends on the hydrophobicity of dye as well as the transport phenomena of I-3(-) throughout the electrolytes. The water-based DSSCs proposed herein are free from water permeation issues and these results will provide great insight into the development of less expensive and more environmental friendly DSSCs.

Previously it has been shown that simply coordinating the metal ion to the nonsurface bound carboxylate groups of a dye molecule can slow recombination rates and increase open-circuit voltages. However, it was unclear if the additional steric effects or charge of the metal ion were the cause of this behavior.

The as-spun nanocomposite membranes were characterized using DSC, XRD and FTIR to study the thermal behaviour, crystallinity and interaction between polymer and fillers. The electrolyte uptake behaviour and impedance response of the electrolyte-activated quasi-solid electrolyte membranes were analyzed. A high conductivity of 1.41x10-2 cm-1 were achieved for 6 wt% of crystalline TiO2 fillers with LiI based redox couple and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) as additive. In order to interpret the conducting mechanism and dielectric response involved in the ion dynamics and relaxation of charge carriers of the prepared quasi-solid electrolytes were analysed by the random barrier model along with the effect of electrode polarization and Havarliak-Negami formalism. The photovoltaic performance of all the prepared electrolytes were investigated for all the fabricated DSSC and obtained an efficiency of 5.93% for electrospun nanocomposite (PVDF-HFP/6wt% of TiO2) polymer with LiI based redox couple and TBP additive, as quasi-solid electrolyte.

Iodide Photoredox and Bond Formation Chemistry	ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH			English	Review							TRANSITION-METAL COMPOUNDS; I-I BONDS; EXCITED-STATES; VISIBLE-LIGHT; POLYPYRIDYL COMPOUNDS; CHARGE-TRANSFER; COMPLEXES; RUTHENIUM(II); PHOTOCHEMISTRY; RECOGNITION	Iodide redox chemistry is intimately coupled with the formation and breaking of chemical bonds that are relevant to emerging solar energy technologies. In this Account, recent advances in dye-sensitized iodide oxidation chemistry in organic solutions are described. Here Ru-II sensitizers with high cationic charge, tuned reduction potentials, and specific iodide receptor site(s) are shown to self-assemble in organic solvents and yield structures that rapidly oxidize iodide and generate I-I bonds when illuminated with visible light. These studies provided new insights into the fascinating behavior of our most polarizable and easily oxidized monatomic anion. Sensitized iodide photo-oxidation in CH3CN solutions consists of two mechanistic steps. In the first step, an excited-state sensitizer oxidizes iodide (I-) to an iodine atom (I-center dot) through diffusional encounters. The second step involves the reaction of I-center dot with I- to form the I-I bond of diiodide, I-2(center dot-). The overall reaction converts a green photon into about 1.64 eV of free energy in the form of I-2(center dot-) and the reduced sensitizer. The free energy is only transiently available, as back-electron transfer to yield ground-state products is quantitative. Interestingly, when the free energy change is near zero, iodide photo-oxidation occurs rapidly with rate constants near the diffusion limit, i.e., >10(10) M-1 s(-1). Such rapid reactivity is in line with anecdotal knowledge that iodide is an outstanding electron donor and is indicative of adiabatic electron transfer through an inner-sphere mechanism. In low-dielectric-constant solvents, dicationic Run sensitizers were found to form tight ion pairs with iodide. Diimine ligands with additional cationic charge, or "binding pockets" that recognize halides, have been utilized to position one or more halides at specific locations about the sensitizer before light absorption. Diverse photochemical reactions observed with these supramolecular assemblies range from the photorelease of halides to the formation of I-I bonds where both iodides present in the ground-state assembly react. Natural population analysis through density functional theory calculations accurately predicts the site(s) of iodide ion-pairing and provides information on the associated free energy change. The ability to direct light-driven bond formation in these ionic assemblies is extended to chloride and bromide ions. The structure-property relationships identified, and those that continue to emerge, may one day allow for the rational design of molecules and materials that drive desired halide transformations when illuminated with light.

J	Su, R; Ashraf, S; El-Shafei, A				Su, Rui; Ashraf, Saba; El-Shafei, Ahmed			Structure-property relationships: "Double-tail versus double-flap" ruthenium complex structures for high efficiency dye-sensitized solar cells	SOLAR ENERGY			English	Article						DSSC; Ru(II) sensitizer; Julolidine; Photocurrent & photovoltage; Charge transfer blocking	RU(II) BIPYRIDYL COMPLEXES; ELECTRON-DONOR; ANCILLARY LIGANDS; COBALT ELECTROLYTE; PI-CONJUGATION; ORGANIC-DYES; PHOTOCURRENT; PHOTOVOLTAGE; FILM; JULOLIDINE	Six novel heteroleptic amphiphilic polypyridyl Ruthenium (II) complexes, coded FS01-FS06, with hetero-aromatic electron-donor ancillary ligands containing julolidine-derived moieties were synthesized to investigate the relationship between structure modulations of electron donors of Ru(II) dyes and their photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). These modulations include: Ru(II) complexes with double "tails" (i.e. tetramethyl groups attached to the end of julolidine-based antennas, FSO4) compared to the ones without double "tails" (FSO1); complexes with double small "flaps" (i.e. small acyclic electron donor auxochromes ortho to the CH = CH bridge of stilbazole, FS02, FS05) compared to the ones with double large "flaps" (FS03, FS06). Their low energy metal-to-ligand charge transfers (MLCT) band and molar absorptivities were all better than those of the benchmark, N719. It was also shown that the incorporation of double "flaps" into the ancillary ligands caused a slight red shift of light absorption. The photovoltaic properties were evaluated under 1.5 AM standard illumination condition and compared to N719. The highest photocurrent density (J(SC)) was observed for the complex with double "tails" and double small "flaps" (FS05). The overall conversion efficiency for devices employing julolidine-derived Ru (II) complexes was in the following order FS05 > FS02 > FSO4 > FS01 > FS06 > FS03. FS05 (8.16%) outperformed the benchmark N719 (7.75%) in the photovoltaic performance, which is due to its best light-harvesting ability, highest molar extinction coefficient and smallest energy band gap among all the six dyes. To probe the interrelationship among julolidine-based electron donors of ancillary ligands, photocurrent and photovoltage of these dyes, the equilibrium molecular geometries of the ancillary ligands were calculated using DFT. The equilibrium molecular geometries of these dyes the photocurrent and photovoltage are dependent on the donating effect of alkyloxy auxochromes, the steric effect generated from the auxochromes and julolidine moieties, and the orientation of longer alkyloxy group. The introduction of double "tails" resulted in less dye aggregation and higher charge recombination resistance, leading to higher photocurrents and photovoltages in the solar cell performances. Despite of the donating effect of alkyloxy groups, the bulky double "flaps" mainly jammed the hole transportation between the redox couple of the electrolyte and the HOMO of thiocyanate groups (- NCS), translating into the decrease of photocurrent.

The highly porous Ni-ZnO samples developed were of high crystalline quality and exhibited great potential for dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) applications on account of the quadrupled intensity values of short-circuit current density of around 1.42mA/cm(2), in contrast to 0.31mA/cm(2) for a bare zinc oxide (ZnO) device. The conversion efficiency of the Ni-ZnO DSSC was measured to be 0.416% which is approximate to 6 times higher than that a of ZnO solar cell. Detailed characterization techniques including x-ray diffraction, photoluminescence, scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy were performed on the samples. The Ni-ZnO samples were found to be crystalline with a hexagonal wurtzite lattice structure. The improved efficiency of Ni-ZnO stems from the enhanced absorption and large surface area of the composite.

The introduction of alkoxyl groups can increase the energy gap between LUMO +1 and LUMO, leading to an increased intramolecular photo -induced electron transfer (PET) efficiency. Both MoTPA-Pyc and OcTPA-Pyc show elongated lifetimes for their CS states, resulting in an enhanced internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of DSSCs. It has been demonstrated that intramolecular PET is the key step for efficient DSSCs due to the presence of long-lived CS states allowing efficient and fast interfacial electron transfer from the CS sensitizers to the TiO2 nanoparticles. The best efficiency of 5.76% was achieved by the MoTPA-Pyc based DSSC through a combined contribution of high IQE and efficient light harvesting. The results suggest that enhancing the intramolecular PET efficiency and the light harvesting ability of the dye-loaded TiO2 film are effective strategies for achieving higher photovoltaic performance for CS sensitizer-based DSSCs.

With increased surface loading of 1, emission from the films is significantly quenched but with a small amount of excimer emission at maximum surface loadings. Long-lived triplets were observed by ns TA spectroscopy that are consistent with singlet fission occurring on mesoporous ZrO2. The evolution of these triplets, however, could not be convincingly resolved by our subnanosecond TA spectroscopy. Dye-sensitized devices composed of 1 on a TiO2|Al2O3 core-shell structure exhibited an unusual decrease, increase, and then decrease in J(sc) with respect to the thickness of Al2O3. In these films the Al2O3 acts as a tunneling barrier to slow electron injection from the singlet excited state such that singlet fission, and electron injection from the triplet state becomes competitive. Proof-of-principle self-assembled bilayer films that exhibit efficient triplet energy transfer from a low energy absorbing dye to 1 is demonstrated as another step toward a SF-based DSSC that can circumvent the Shockley-Queisser limit.

Here, we review some of our recent theoretical work aimed at accurate evaluation of key materials properties associated with optimizing alternative PV materials. These include potential new light absorbers and transparent conductors in devices ranging from traditional PVs to tandem dye-sensitized solar cells and thin-film PVs to intermediate band gap PVs. We specifically focus on two materials families: transition-metal oxides (TMOs), such as NiO, CoO, FeO, and Cu2O, and mixed metal sulfides, such as Cu2ZnSnS4. Both families are p-type semiconductors being explored as less expensive solar cell components.

Herein, we report a robust strategy to craft nitrogen-doped carbon nanowires (NCWs) through combining oxidation polymerization from p-phenylenediamine with carbonization process. Owing to the abundant edges of the graphite microcrystals embedded in the NCWs and the incorporated N species, the NCWs synthesized at 700 degrees C exhibit a superior response to the I-3(-) reduction in DSSCs with a high power conversion efficiency of 8.90%, outperforming the Pt reference (8.09%), and a high stability is also manifested. Theoretical calculations reveal that, of various doped N species within NCWs, the quaternary N species can significantly decrease the ionization energy and modulate the spin density distribution of carbon frameworks, thus promoting the electron transfer from the external circuit to the electrolyte. Natural population analysis further reveals that the active centers within the NCWs for the I-3(-) reduction are those positively charged carbon atoms adjacent to the quaternary N. As such, this work will pave an avenue for rational design and engineering of inexpensive yet high-efficiency carbon electrocatalysts for the advanced energy applications.

In the present study, it is shown that the electronic properties of TiO2 nanotubes can be drastically improved by inducing a nanotwinned grain structure in the nanotube wall. This structure can be exclusively induced for "single-walled" nanotubes with a high-temperature treatment in pure oxygen atmospheres. Nanotubes with a twinned grain structure within the tube wall show a strongly enhanced conductivity and photogenerated charge transport compared to classic nanotubes. This remarkable improvement is exemplified in the electronic properties by using nanotwinned TiO2 nanotubes in dye-sensitized solar cells where a significant increase in efficiency of up to 10.2% is achieved.

Surface potential properties of TiO2 nanoparticle film coated on the ITO-LiNbO3 (TiO2/ITO-LiNbO3) examined by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) confirmed that a large electric field (a few 10 V/mu m) generated from LiNbO3 can penetrate through the ITO layer and is applied to TiO2 film. This polarization-induced electric field leads to an increased photocurrent density by attracting and promoting electrons to direct transport through the mesoporous TiO2 network toward the collector electrode and a decreased charge recombination by facilitating electrons to pass through fewer boundaries of nanoparticles, resulting in high power conversion efficiency. The power conversion efficiency was enhanced by more than 40% in comparison with that without polarization-induced electric field. Incorporating functional ferroelectrics into photovoltaic cells would be a good strategy in improving photovoltaic performance and is applicable to other types of photovoltaic devices, such as perovskite solar cells.

The favorable material properties, enormous surface area, and enhanced light scattering capacity support the promise of diatom frustules as candidates for next generation biomedical devices and energy applications. In this study, the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) method is employed to incorporate silica nanowires on the surface of diatom frustules. Compared to the original frustule structures, the frustule-nanowire composite material's surface area increases over 3-fold, and the light scattering ability increases by 10%. By varying the gold catalyst thickness during the VLS process, tuning of the resultant nanowire length/density is achieved. Through material characterization, it is determined that both float growth and root growth processes jointly result in the growth of the silica nanowires. From a thermodynamics point of view, the preferential growth of the silica nanowires on frustules is found to have resulted from the enormous partial surface area of gold nanoparticles on the diatom frustules. The frustule-nanowire composite materials have potential applications in the development of novel biomedical sensing devices and may greatly enhance next generation solar cell performance.

J	James, S; Contractor, R				James, Sagil; Contractor, Rinkesh			Study on Nature-inspired Fractal Design-based Flexible Counter Electrodes for Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells Fabricated using Additive Manufacturing	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							PHOTOVOLTAICS; EFFICIENCY; PROGRESS	Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSC) are third generation solar cells used as an alternative to traditional silicon solar cells. DSSCs are characterized by their durability, easy handling and ability to perform better under diverse lighting conditions which makes them an ideal choice for indoor applications. However, DSSCs suffer from several limitations including low efficiencies, susceptibility to electrolyte leakage under extreme weather conditions, and the need for expensive materials and fabrication techniques which limits their large-scale industrial applications. Addressing these limitations through efficient design and manufacturing techniques are critical in ensuring that the DSSCs transform from the current small-scale laboratory levels to sizeable industrial production. This research attempts to address some of these significant limitations by introducing the concepts of nature-inspired fractal-based design followed by the additive manufacturing process to fabricate cost-effective, flexible counter electrodes for DSSCs. The new conceptual fractal-based design counter electrodes overcome the limitations of conventional planar designs by significantly increasing the number of active reaction sites which enhances the catalytic activity thereby improving the performance. The fabrication of these innovative fractal designs is realized through cost-effective manufacturing techniques including additive manufacturing and selective electrochemical co-deposition processes. The results of the study suggest that the fractal-based counter electrodes perform better than conventional designs. Additionally, the fractal designs and additive manufacturing technology help in addressing the problems of electrolyte leakage, cost of fabrication, and scalability of DSSCs.

A Molecular Silane-Derivatized Ru(II) Catalyst for Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							DYE; STABILIZATION; CHROMOPHORE; COMPLEXES; RUTHENIUM; TIO2; PHOTOANODES; ASSEMBLIES; DESIGN; SITE	Photoanodes in dye-sensitized photoelectrosynthesis cells integrate molecular chromophore/catalyst assemblies on mesoporous n-type metal oxide electrodes for light-driven water oxidation. One limitation for sustainable photoanodes is the stability of chromophore/catalyst assembly on electrode surfaces for long periods. Progress has been made in stabilizing chromophores based on atomic layer deposition, polymer dip coating, C-C cross coupling by electropolymerization, and silane surface binding, but little progress has been made on catalyst stabilization. We report here the silane-derivatized catalyst, Ru(bda)(L)(2) (bda = 2,2'-bipyridine-6,6'-dicarboxylate, L = 4-(6-(triethoxysilyl)hexyl)pyridine), catalyst 1, which is stabilized on metal oxide electrode surfaces over an extended pH range. A surface stabilization study shows that it maintains its reactivity on the electrode surface toward electrochemical oxidation over a wide range of conditions. Its electrochemical stability on electrode surfaces has been systematically evaluated, and its role as a catalyst for water oxidation has been explored. On surfaces of mesoporous nanostructured core/shell SnO2/TiO2, with a TiO2 stabilized inner layer of the Ru(II) polypyridyl chromophore, [Ru(4,4'-(PO3H2)(2)bpy)(bpy)(2)](2+) (RuP2+; bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine), highly efficient photoelectrochemical water oxidation catalysis occurs to produce O-2 with a maximum efficiency of similar to 1.25 mA/cm(2). Long-term loss of catalytic activity occurs with time owing to catalyst loss from the electrode surface by axial ligand dissociation in the high oxidation states of the catalyst.

Time-independent B3LYP density functional calculations were performed to assign vibrational bands and determine their respective transition dipole moments. The transient absorption spectral band at 1327 cm(-1), assigned to a symmetric carboxylate stretch, showed significant anisotropy. A rapid anisotropy increase (tau(1) approximate to 2 ps) was tentatively assigned to vibrational and solvent relaxation, considering the excess energy available after the excited singlet-triplet conversion. Thereafter, the anisotropy decayed to zero with a time constant tau(2) approximate to 240 ps, which was assigned to the rotational correlation time of the complex in deuterated acetonitrile. No other distinctive changes to the anisotropy were observed and the amplitude of the slow component at time zero agrees well with that predicted for a random mixture of MLCT localization on either of the two dcb ligands. The results therefore suggest that MLCT randomization over the two dcb ligands occurs on the sub-ps time scale. This is much faster than proposed by previous reports on the related N3 complex [Benko et al., J. Phys. Chem. B, 2004, 108, 2862, and Waterland et al., J. Phys. Chem. A, 2001, 105, 4019], but in agreement with that found by Wallin and co-workers [J. Phys. Chem. A, 2005, 109, 4697] for the [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) (bpy = 2,2-bipyridine) complex.

Rapid and Low-Temperature Processing of Mesoporous and Nanocrystalline TiO2 Film Using Microwave Irradiation	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						nanoporous TiO2; microwave irradiation; low temperature processing; dye-sensitized solar cell; microwave attenuation; fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO)	SENSITIZED SOLAR-CELLS; THIN-FILMS; SPRAY-PYROLYSIS; ANATASE; COST	Nanoporous (np)-TiO2 films have multiple applications, including dye-sensitized and perovskite solar cells. However, preparation of np-TiO2 films on transparent conductive oxide-coated surfaces (e.g., fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO)) requires high-temperature sintering (450-500 degrees C) for at least 30-60 min in a conventional oven. Here, we introduce a novel technique to rapidly produce np-TiO2 films on FTO-coated glass substrates via microwave (MW) irradiation. np-TiO2 films were sintered on FTO-glass substrates in less than 10 min at temperatures less than 260 degrees C using an optimized MW irradiation program and a simple MW attenuation technique. Significantly, cracking of FTO-coated glass substrates was avoided during MW irradiation, which was a limiting problem in previous studies. MW-developed films were evaluated with UV vis absorption spectrophotometry, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and atomic force microscopy, with MW-developed films (>4 min) producing essentially identical characteristics as conventionally annealed films. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) fabricated with MW-developed films (8 min) demonstrated an overall power conversion efficiency of 7.16% as compared to 7.04% for conventionally-fabricated DSSCs. This rapid and low-temperature sintering technique saves time and energy and may also pave the way for deposition of np-TiO2 films on plastic-based substrates.

Integrated photocapacitors based on dye-sensitized TiO2/FTO as photoanode and MnO2 coated micro-array CNTs as supercapacitor counter electrode with TEABF4 electrolyte	JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY			English	Article							ENERGY-STORAGE; SOLAR-CELL; CARBON; OXIDE	Harvesting solar energy using dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) has been a promising option. Successful integration of a DSSC electrode with an energy storage electrode represents the next challenge for the researchers. In this paper, the fabrication and characterization of an integrated dye-sensitized photoanode and a supercapacitor cathode or a photocapacitor has been presented. This novel device employs N-719 dye-sensitized titanium dioxide on fluorine-doped tin oxide glass substrate as the photoanode. The supercapacitive counter electrode comprises MnO2 coated, vertically aligned, micro-array patterned carbon nanotubes (MA-CNTs). The CNTs were grown on n++ silicon (Si) substrates in a hot filament chemical vapor deposition system followed by in-situ electrochemical deposition of MnO2. Tetraethyl ammonium tetrafluoroborate electrolyte was used to investigate the photovoltaic and energy storage performances of the photocapacitors under 1-sun illumination and constant-current discharge tests. A high discharge capacitance of 13 mF/cm(2) at 0.932V was achieved by coating MnO2 onto the high surface area of MA-CNTs due to the pseudocapacitive behavior of MnO2, which led to a nearly 3-fold increase in the short circuit current density to 0.749 mA/cm(2) and more than a 2-fold enhancement in the open circuit voltage to 0.46V, as compared to the baseline CNT counter electrode. The corresponding increase in the fill factor and efficiency was also observed. Overall, we have demonstrated the viability of a compact, easy to fabricate, integrated photocapacitor with promising energy generation/storage performance. Published by AIP Publishing.

In this article, we report on the fabrication and photovoltaic characteristics of DSSCs with vertically aligned carbon nanotube (CNT)-based DSSC counter electrodes. Our DSSCs utilized three different counter electrodes with CNTs in planar (P-CNT) and micro-array patterned (MA-CNT) configurations and platinum (Pt)-film coated Si as the control sample. The CNTs were grown in planar and micro-array patterned configurations directly on highly doped n-type silicon substrates by a hot-filament chemical vapor deposition process. In combination with an N-719 dye-sensitized titanium dioxide (TiO2) coated onto a fluorine doped tin oxide coated glass substrate as the photoanode and an iodide-based electrolyte, our P-CNT as the counter electrode showed a very high photocurrent density (J(sc)) of 26.3mA/ cm(2) and a power conversion efficiency (n) of 7.13% when compared to platinum's J(SC) of 20.6mA/cm(2) and g of 6.29%. The photovoltaic behavior of the micro-array patterned CNTs was also characterized, providing a better understanding of their electrocatalytic performance for the DSSCs. Overall, this work demonstrates the superior and improved photovoltaic performance of the vertically-aligned CNTs as the DSSC counter electrode, which makes them a stronger alternative to platinum counter electrodes.

Interconnected ZrO2 doped ZnO/TiO2 network photoanode for dye-sensitized solar cells	ENERGY REPORTS			English	Article						ZrO2 passivated ZnO/TiO2 hetero-phase composite; Mesoporous films dye-sensitized solar cells; Dark current; Equivalent circuit model	CHARGE RECOMBINATION; CONDUCTION-BAND; TIO2; OXIDE; EFFICIENT; IMPROVEMENT; LAYER; PHOTOELECTRODES; NANOPARTICLES; PERFORMANCE	In this study, ZrO2 surface modified ZnO/TiO2 composite film is adapted as photoanode in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and compared with un-passivated ZnO/TiO2 DSSC performance. The performance is investigated by dark and photocurrent density-voltage (J-V) characteristics, quantum efficiency and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The J-V characteristics shows that DSSCs with ZrO2 surface passivation produces significantly high open-circuit voltage of 0.87 V, short-circuit current density of 13.6 mA cm(-2), fill factor of 0.65 and a power conversion efficiency of similar to 6.97% under simulated AM1.5 solar irradiation. The higher onset potential in the dark, larger open-circuit potential under illumination, and an enhancement in power conversion efficiency strongly suggests an efficient suppression of back electron transfer from the conduction band of the hetero-phase junctions to the oxidized species in the electrolyte as established by dark and illuminated J-V characteristics. Thus, the oxidized dye molecules are readily regenerated by a redox couple dissolved in an electrolyte, allowing more photon excitation by dye molecules. The electrochemical impedance data extracts further provide additional evidence of the enhancement in photocurrent and lower charge carrier resistances observed in ZrO2/ZnO/TiO2/dye photoelectrode. With the ZrO2 surface modification, main loss mechanism in the device is suppressed and backward recombination reaction is minimized. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI) and camphorsulfonic acid (C10H16O4S) were separately added to the gel-based electrolytes. The results indicate that adding LiTFSI and C10H16O4S to the gel-based electrolytes effectively enhanced the device efficiency. In particular, the device with the 1:1 + 0.1 M LiTFSI gel-based electrolyte exhibited the optimal efficiency (7.33%), which was higher than that observed in the device with the liquid-based electrolyte. The results also proved that the DSSC devices with the gel-based electrolytes exhibited a longer stability. Therefore, using optimized gel-based electrolytes can enhance the power conversion efficiency and stability of DSSC devices.

We present here the fabrication of graphene oxide electrocatalyst supported polyaniline (GO/PANI) composite film via an in-situ electrochemical polymerization method and used it as transparent counter electrode (CE) for solid-state BDSSCs. The GO provides a large number of active nucleation sites, resulting in the formation of continuous PANI films through strong covalent bonds, which significantly increase the specific surface area and catalytic activity of the CE and further accelerate the charge transfer in the corresponding BDSSC. Due to the improved electrochemical catalytic activity of the GO/PANI CE with GO mass ratio of 0.6 wt%, both-illuminated power conversion efficiency of 5.74% with short-circuit current density of 20.23 mA cm(-2) and open circuit voltage of 0.63 V is obtained for the solid-state BDSSC, which is 155.6% of the conventional bare PANI based BDSSC under front-irradiation. Electrochemical and electron transport/recombination performances have also been demonstrated for this type of device. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) loadings of 295.6 mg/g were achieved, equivalent to 518.9 mu mol/g. Through an aqueous-phase mixing process, a solution of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) was used to aggregate colloids of unilamellar anionic nanosheets, derived from the exfoliation of the layered semiconductor KTiNbO5. The aggregates formed were porous metal oxide composite materials with Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) electrostatically bound within the structure of the pore walls. The new solids were highly orange-colored due to the high internal content of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+). X-ray diffraction and chemical and theoretical analyses indicate that the ruthenium dye is incorporated as a single layer between the metal oxide sheets and that the dye loading is maximized. In well-rinsed samples, the Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) remained in the solid with only trace amounts of leaching even after 3 months in water at room temperature. The strategy demonstrated here is general enough to be applicable to other layered metal oxides. This report describes the first successful use of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and restacked KTiNbO5 to synthesize a stable, dye-sensitized, porous metal oxide semiconductor material. Improved sensitizer loadings correlate with light capture efficiencies, giving this new technique promise in solar energy conversion technologies.

J	Alkuam, E; Badradeen, E; Guisbiers, G				Alkuam, Entidhar; Badradeen, Emad; Guisbiers, Gregory			Influence of CdS Morphology on the Efficiency of Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells	ACS OMEGA			English	Article							NANOROD ARRAYS; CADMIUM-SULFIDE; RUTILE TIO2; THIN-FILMS; FABRICATION; NANOWIRES; GROWTH; NANOPARTICLES; CRYSTALLITES; PHOTOANODES	Cadmium sulfide (CdS) used in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) is currently mainly synthesized by chemical bath deposition, vacuum evaporation, spray deposition, chemical vapor deposition, electrochemical deposition, sol-gel, solvothermal, radio frequency sputtering, and hydrothermal process. In this paper, CdS was synthesized by hydrothermal process and used with a mixture of titanium dioxide anatase and rutile (TiO2(A+R)) to build the photoanode, whereas the counter electrode was made of nanocomposites of conductive polymer polyaniline (PANI) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) deposited on a fluorine-doped tin oxide substrate. Two morphologies of CdS have been obtained by using hydrothermal process: branched nanorods (CdSBR) and straight nanorods (CdSNR). The present work indicates that controlling the morphology of CdS is crucial to enhance the efficiency of DSSCs device. Indeed, the higher power conversion energy of 1.71% was achieved for a cell CdSBR-TiO2(A+R)/PANI-MWCNTs under 100 mW/cm(2), whereas the power conversion energy of 0.97 and 0.83% for CdSNR-TiO2(A+R)/PANI-MWCNTs and TiO2(A+R)/PANI-MWCNTs, respectively. Therefore, by increasing the surface to volume ratio of CdS nanostructures and the crystallite size into those structures opens the way to low-cost chemical production of solar cells.

The novel device architecture of offering graded bands into the TiO2 photoanode network of DSSCs is presented to enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE). Mono (x %) as well as graded (w-x-y-z %) W-doped TiO2 films are prepared to form intermediate bands in the bandgap of TiO2. A significant enhancement in the PCE is achieved when mono x % W-TiO2 films are tested as the photoanode of the DSSCs. Furthermore, DSSCs with band-engineered W-TiO2 cascade layer exhibit significant photovoltaic performance showing graded carrier transport to current collector. In particular, a graded 1-5-7-9 W cascade film exhibits the highest photovoltaic performance of 11.30% without decreasing the open-circuit voltage, which is 48% higher than pristine DSSCs without a blocking layer. This graded carrier transport suggests an innovative route toward harvesting solar energy.

The quantum dots are synthesized inside ferritin protein shells (PbS-FTN). Our synthesis method is simpler than what has previously been reported for PbS-FTN quantum dots, namely we demonstrate that the synthesizing reaction can be run in an aerobic environment and with a Pb:S ratio of 1:1. Protection from photocorrosion is demonstrated by comparing the time evolution of photoluminescence from PbS-FTN with that of non-ferritin PbS quantum dots. In the photovoltaic testing, we use a dye-sensitized solar cell scheme with PbS-FTN as the dye and test several methods to adsorb PbS-FTN to the mesoporous TiO2 layer which is coated on the solar cell anodes. The highest performing cell shows an efficiency of 0.29% using the drop casting method.	[Hansen, Kameron R.; Peterson, J.

Herein, a series of Fe1-xCoxS2 (x=0-0.5) solid solutions have been synthesized and served as counter electrodes in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The Fermi level of Fe1-xCoxS2 solid solutions shifted negatively as the x value changed from 0 to 0.5, and the electrocatalytic performance for I-3(-) reduction gradually enhanced due to the facilitated electron transfer process from electrode to I-3(-). Benefitting from its negative Fermi level, Fe0.5Co0.5S2 exhibited the smallest charge transfer resistance (R-ct) and remarkable electrocatalytic properties. The DSSCs using Fe0.5Co0.5S2 as a counter electrode achieve the lowest R-ct (0.84 Omega cm(2)) and the highest power conversion efficiency (eta=8.36%) of these solid solution materials.

Using previously reported CS sensitizer MTPA-Pyc or YD-Pyc as the model molecule, cyano group or benzotriazole were incorporated into the donor module and the electrochemical, spectral and photophysical properties were investigated. Incorporating electron-withdrawing structures enhances the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and conjugation of the donor module which leads to not only remarkably red-shifted absorption spectra, but also elongated lifetime of CS state of the sensitizers, thus resulting in an over 30% increase of power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the DSSCs. Combination of an electron-withdrawing benzotriazole with a strong electron-donating indoline moiety in the donor module produces the best PCE of 7.41% for DSSC based on YDBT-Pyc. Our results provide not only the rational design principles for CS sensitizers, but also insight into the feasibility of CS sensitizers for high performance photovoltaic applications.

Ligands L1-L6 were isolated in respectable yields and characterized by microanalysis, IR spectroscopy, H-1 NMR spectroscopy, and ESI-MS mass spectrometry. A series of dinuclear Cu(I) complexes 1-10 have been synthesized by reacting L1-L6 with CuI and triphenylphosphine (PPh3) (R1) or with an anchored phosphine derivative, 4-(diphenylphosphino) benzoic acid (R2)/2-(diphenylphosphino)benzenesulfonic acid (R3), in a stoichiometric ratio. The complexes are soluble in common organic solvents and have been characterized by analytical, spectroscopic, and computational methods. Single-crystal X-ray structure analysis confirmed rhomboid dimeric structures for complexes 1, 2, 4, and 5, and a polymeric structure for 6. Complexes 1-6 showed oxidation potential responses close to 0.9 V vs Fc(0/+), which were chemically irreversible and are likely to be associated with multiple steps and core oxidation. Preliminary photovoltaic (PV) results of these new materials indicated moderate power conversion efficiency (PCE) in the range of 0.15-1.56% in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The highest PCE was achieved with complex 10 bearing the sulfonic acid anchoring functionality.

N719 dye has carboxyl groups that bind to the surface of mesoporous TiO2 whereas Ru-BPY contains no such anchoring groups capable of binding to the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles. The dyes were characterized using absorption spectroscopy, emission measurements and lifetime measurements. The wavelength of maximum absorption for the N719 was 525 nm but this was blue shifted to 516 nm upon attachment to the titanium dioxide substrate. The wavelength of maximum absorption for the Ru-BPY was 450 nm before and after application of the dye to titanium dioxide indicating that the interaction of the anchoring groups with the TiO2 nanoparticles had an effect on the absorption band of the N719. The N719 dye sensitized solar cell yielded a solar-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency of 1.35%, which was much higher than that of Ru-BPY (0.09%), thus indicating that anchoring groups on dye sensitizers greatly increase the efficiency of dye sensitized solar cell.

To battle this issue a band gap materials engineering needs to be considered. In this study, a numerical model analysis is developed to take into consideration the effect of iodide and tri-iodide on the electron transport through the mesoporous oxide film. For this reason this research intend to solve the continuity equation for the iodide, tri-iodide and the electron transport using FDM method to investigate the effect electrolyte properties on the performance of DSSCs. The simulation results demonstrate that in order to achieve the highest exergy efficiency it is suggested to have electron transport rate above 1.45 x 10(-7) (cm/s), the TiO2 porosity to be in the range of 0.36-0.42, the recombination and the regeneration rate above the 2.693 x 10(-7) (cm/s) and 1.55 x 10(-7) (cm/s) respectively. The results also showed that peak target of electron transport rate, recombination rate, and regeneration rate enhance the light harvesting efficiency and DSSCs exergy efficiency.

The efficient synthetic protocols on phase structure evolution and dynamic decomposition behavior enable the production of the Fe1-xS/Fe3C-NCNT hybrid with advanced structural and electronic properties, in which the Fe vacancy contained Fe1-xS showed the 3d metallic state electrons and an electroactive Fe in +2/+3 valence, and the electronic structure of the CNT was effectively modulated by the incorporated Fe3C and N, with the work function decreased from 4.85 to 4.63 eV. The meticulous structural, electronic, and compositional control unveils the unusual synergetic catalytic properties for the Fe1-xS/Fe3C-NCNT hybrid when developed as counter electrodes (CEs) for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), in which the Fe3C- and N incorporated CNTs with reduced work function and increased charge density provide a highway for electron transport and facilitate the electron migration from Fe3C-NCNTs to ultrahigh active Fe1-xS with the electron-donating effect, and the Fe vacancy-enriched Fe1-xS nanoparticles exhibit ultrahigh I-3(-) adsorption and charge-transfer ability. As a consequence, the DSSC based on the Fe1-xS/Fe3C-NCNT CE delivers a high power conversion efficiency of 8.67% and good long-term stability with a remnant efficiency of 8.00% after 168 h of illumination, superior to those of traditional Pt. Furthermore, the possible catalytic mechanism toward I-3(-) reduction is creatively proposed based on the structure-activity correlation. In this work, the structure engineering, electronic modulation, and composition control opens up new possibilities electrocatalytic nanoarchitecture for highly efficient CEs in DSSCs.

Although an enhancement of PCE because of the incorporation of plasmonic nanostructures of different sizes, either bare or coated, has been demonstrated, the fundamental mechanisms associated to such enhancement are still unclear. Besides, the photocurrent enhancement of plasmonic DSSCs is frequently associated to the strong surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption of metal nanoparticles. In this work, through oxygen K-edge soft X-ray absorption and emission spectroscopies of plasmonic electrodes and electrodynamical characterization of the fabricated cells, we demonstrate a band gap narrowing and photocharging effect on the plasmonic electrodes that definitely contribute to the PCE enhancement in plasmonic DSSCs. The incorporation of bare metal nanoparticles in active metal oxide semiconductor electrodes such as TiO2 in optimum concentration causes an upward shift of its valence band edge, reducing its effective band gap energy and enhancing the short-circuit current of DSSCs. On the other hand, small perturbation-based stepped light-induced transient measurements of photovoltage and photocurrent of the operating DSSCs revealed an upward shift of quasi-Fermi level of photoelectrodes because of the photocharging effect induced by the incorporated metal nanoparticles. The upward shift of the quasi-Fermi level causes an increase in open-circuit voltage (V-OC), nullifying the effect of band gap reduction. The short-circuit photocurrent enhancement was controlled by the band gap narrowing, screening the SPR contribution. The results presented in this work not only clarify the contribution of SPR absorption in plasmonic DSSCs, but also highlight the importance of considering the corrections in the effective base voltage because of the quasi-Fermi level band shift during the estimation of the transport and recombination parameters of an assembled DSSC.

Charge Recombination with Fractional Reaction Orders in Water-Splitting Dye-Sensitized Photoelectrochemical Cells	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							PEROVSKITE SOLAR-CELLS; INTERFACIAL ELECTRON-TRANSFER; INTENSITY-MODULATED PHOTOVOLTAGE; NANOCRYSTALLINE TIO2; BAND-EDGE; PHOTOCURRENT SPECTROSCOPY; TICL4 TREATMENT; DYNAMICS; KINETICS; TRANSPORT	In water-splitting dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells (WS-DSPECs), charge recombination competes with catalytic water oxidation to determine the overall efficiency of the system. The kinetics of these processes have been difficult to understand because transient absorbance (TA) experiments typically show nearly complete charge recombination on the submillisecond time scale; in contrast, electrochemical measurements such as open circuit photovoltage decay suggest a charge recombination time scale that is 2-3 orders of magnitude longer. Here we explore these processes with dye-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 and TiO2/Ta2O5 core-shell photoanodes in aqueous electrolytes using TA spectroscopy, intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS), and photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS). The fast recombination rates measured by TA result from strong laser excitation that leads to high electron occupancy in TiO2, whereas IMVS modulates the concentration of charge-separated states near solar irradiance levels. The recombination processes measured by electrochemical methods such as IMVS, PEIS, and transient photovoltage are the discharging of injected electrons in TiO2, as evidenced by the close agreement between the nearly first-order recombination rates probed by IMVS and the RC time constants derived from PEIS data. However, IMVS measurements at variable probe light intensity reveal that the reaction orders for the recombination of injected electrons with oxidized sensitizer molecules are far from unity. This kinetic analysis is relevant to understanding steady-state recombination rates in full WS-DSPECs in which molecular and nanoparticle catalysts are used to oxidize water.

The ground- and excited-state reduction potentials were tuned over 500 mV by the introduction of electron. withdrawing groups in the 4 and 4' positions of the ancillary bipyridine ligands. Upon light excitation of the surface-bound photocatalysts, excited-state electron injection yielded an oxidized photocatalyst that was regenerated through bromide oxidation. High injection quantum yields (Phi(inj)) and regeneration quantum yields (Phi(reg)) were essential to obtain efficient bromide oxidation yet required a photocatalyst that is both a potent photoreductant and a strong oxidant after excited-state injection. The four photocatalysts utilized in this manuscript ranged from unity Phi(inj) (1.0) and minimal Phi(reg) (0.037) to minimal Phi(inj) (0.09) and unity Phi(reg) (1.0). The photocatalyst that displayed the highest overall dye-sensitized photoelectrosynthesis cell performances exhibited near unity Phi(reg) (0.99), while a significant Phi(inj) was still preserved (0.59). Thus, these results highlighted the delicate interplay between the ground- and excited-state reduction potentials of photocatalysts for dye-sensitized hydrobromic acid splitting.

This task, however, is highly challenging experimentally, because an adsorbing carbon surface may easily conceal its intrinsic reactivity through adventitious contamination. Herein, we employ nanoscale scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) and cyclic voltammetry to gain new insights into the interplay between heterogeneous ET and adsorption of a Co(III)/Co(II)-complex redox couple at the contamination-free surface of electron-beam-deposited carbon (eC). Specifically, we investigate the redox couple of tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt(II), Co(phen)(3)(2+), as a promising mediator for dye-sensitized solar cells and redox flow batteries. A pristine eC surface overlaid with KC1 is prepared in vacuum, protected from contamination in air, and exposed to an ultrapure aqueous solution of Co(phen)(3)(2+) by the dissolution of the protective KC1 layer. We employ SECM-based nanogap voltammetry to quantitatively demonstrate that Co(phen)(3)(2+) is adsorbed on the pristine eC surface to electrostatically self-inhibit outer-sphere ET of nonadsorbed Co(phen)(3)(3+) and Co(phen)(3)(2+). Strong electrostatic repulsion among Co(phen)(3)(2+) adsorbates is also demonstrated by SECM-based nanogap voltammetry and cyclic voltammetry. Quantitatively, self-inhibitory ET is characterized by a linear decrease in the standard rate constant of Co(phen)(3)(2+) oxidation with a higher surface concentration of Co(phen)(3)(2+) at the formal potential. This unique relationship is consistent not with the Frumkin model of double layer effects, but with the Amatore model of partially blocked electrodes as extended for self-inhibitory ET. Significantly, the complicated coupling of electron transfer and surface adsorption is resolved by combining nanoscale and macroscale voltammetric methods.

Spin-Doctoring Cobalt Redox Shuttles for Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells	INORGANIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article							ELECTRON-TRANSFER MEDIATORS; VIBRATIONAL-SPECTRA; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; CHARGE-TRANSFER; COMPLEXES; REGENERATION; RECOMBINATION; NMR; PERTURBATION; EFFICIENCY	A new low-spin (LS) cobalt(II) outer-sphere redox shuttle (OSRS) [Co(PY5Me(2))(CN)](+), where PYSMe2 represents the pentadentate ligand 2,6-bis(1,1-bis(2-pyridyl)ethyl)pyridine, has been synthesized and characterized for its potential application in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Introduction of the strong field CN- ligand into the open axial coordination site forced the cobalt(II) complex, [Co-(PY5Me(2))(CN)](+), to become LS based upon the complex's magnetic susceptibility (1.91 +/- 0.02 mu(B)), determined by the Evans method. Interestingly, dimerization and subsequent cobalt hexacyanide cluster formation of the [Co(PY5Me(2))(CN)](+) monomer was observed upon long-term solvent exposure or addition of a supporting electrolyte for electrochemical characterization. Although long-term stability of the [Co(PY5Me(2))(CN)](+) complex made it difficult to fabricate liquid electrolytes for DSSC applications, short-term stability in neat solvent afforded the opportunity to isolate the self-exchange kinetics of [Co(PYSMe2)(CN)](2+/+) via stopped-flow spectroscopy. Use of Marcus theory provided a smaller than expected self-exchange rate constant of 20 +/- 5.5 M-1 s(-1) for [Co(PY5Me(2))(CN)](2+/+), which we attribute to a Jahn-Teller effect observed from the collected monomer crystallographic data. When compared sideby-side to cobalt tris(2,2'-bipyridine), [Co(bpy)(3)](3+), DSSCs employing [Co(PY5Me(2))(CN)](2+) are expected to achieve superior charge collection, which result from a smaller rate constant, k(et), for recombination based upon simple dark J-E measurements of the two redox shuttles. Given the negative redox potential (0.254 V vs NHE) of [Co(PY5Me(2))(CN)](2+/+) and the slow recombination kinetics, [Co(PY5Me(2))(CN)](2+/+) becomes an attractive OSRS to regenerate near IR absorbing sensitizers in solid-state DSSC devices.

J	Hlynchuk, S; MacInnes, MM; Maldonado, S				Hlynchuk, Sofiya; MacInnes, Molly M.; Maldonado, Stephen			Sensitization of p-GaP by Physisorbed Triarylmethane Dyes	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							GALLIUM-PHOSPHIDE ELECTRODES; STIMULATED HOLE INJECTION; SOLAR-CELLS; SEMICONDUCTOR ELECTRODES; PHOTOELECTROCHEMICAL CELLS; PHOTOVOLTAIC DEVICES; GRAPHITE-ELECTRODES; HIGH-EFFICIENCY; CARBON-DIOXIDE; PHOTOCATHODE	p-Type gallium phosphide (GaP) electrodes have been sensitized by triarylmethane dyes physisorbed from aqueous solutions. This work is the first to show light-stimulated hole injection from an adsorbed molecular chromophore on native GaP surfaces. Freshly etched p-GaP(100) and p-GaP(111)A electrodes were loaded with physisorbed dye by brief soaking in solutions of Fast Green. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, corroborated by Auger electron spectroscopy, indicated that such treatments yield undetectable surface coverages. However, steady-state photo-electrochemical responses consistently showed that sub-bandgap photoresponses were commensurate with light absorption by the adsorbed dye. The photoresponse characteristics were clearly insensitive to the identity and amount of intended redox mediators dissolved in solution at low light intensities. Instead, the data suggest electrochemically active surface states related to the cathodic degradation of GaP can accept electrons from photoexcited physisorbed dye. Measurements at high illumination intensities showed sensitivity toward redox mediators in solution, indicating that the conventional mode of dye regeneration by redox species in solution is possible with p-GaP. Separate measurements with covalently modified p-GaP(111)A photoelectrodes further suggested that deliberate modification to minimize/eliminate surface states is also possible. Collectively, this work indicates that although some types of dye readily adsorb onto native GaP interfaces, the low dye loadings and the susceptibility of the interface to chemical attack during the sensitization process argue against using bare p-GaP photocathodes with physisorbed triarylmethane dyes. Instead, these studies suggest that dye-sensitized photocathodes based on p-GaP require deliberate surface chemical modification methods to overcome the low loading and inhibit unwanted charge transfer between the surface and the photoexcited dye.

Here, we demonstrate a highly efficient and highly semitransparent LSC-PVs capable of harvesting dual wavelength bands. We used a triplet-triplet annihilation-based photon upconversion (UC) LSC that luminesce high energy green light by absorbing low energy red light, as well as downshift LSC that luminesce green light by absorbing ultraviolet light. The luminescent light concentrated from the two LSCs is absorbed by a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) having a high extinction coefficient at this wavelength. Our optimized dual band LS-CPV exhibited 27% higher power conversion efficiency than the LSC-PV that absorb a single wavelength band. With respect to practical applications, the dual band LSC-DSSCs were fabricated in the form of an LSC window-DSSC window frame. We achieved a power conversion efficiency of 9.1% per LSC panel area. This dual-band LSC-DSSC exhibited high stability and maintained efficiency even at oblique illumination. Our results will be promising as an aesthetic and energy independent next generation BIPV.

Under similar fabrication conditions, the photovoltaic performances of these dyes were evaluated and compared to the standard ruthenium complex N719. MR-1 and MR-2 showed the efficiencies of 8.19% and 5.32%, respectively, while N719 achieved 7.66%. MR-1 also displayed higher V-oc than MR-2, which is due to the larger molecular size and higher molar extinction coefficient of the former, which translates into less dye aggregation on a thinner film of TiO2. Incorporation of terthiophene as a linker reduces the band gap of MR-1 when compared to that of MR-2. The influence of pi-conjugated bridge on optical and electrochemical properties was investigated. Results demonstrated that the absorption band of MR-1 displayed higher extinction coefficient with a broader absorption compared to MR-2 and the benchmark Ru(II) dye, N719, due to the enhancement of electron donating ability of n-conjugated bridge.

The role of lithium cations on the photochemistry of ruthenium complexes in dye-sensitized solar cells: A TDDFT study with the BCL model	JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY A-CHEMISTRY			English	Article							TRANSITION-METAL COMPOUNDS; ELECTRON-TRANSFER; TIO2 INTERFACES; PERFORMANCE; IONS; APPROXIMATION; RECOMBINATION; INJECTION; SURFACES	Lithium cations have been shown to impart an electrostatic Stark effect on molecules bound to mesoporous metal oxides commonly used in dye-sensitized solar cells. Herein, using the Barrera-Crivelli-Loeb theoretical model accompanied by Time Dependent Density Functional Theory calculations, we examined the influence that lithium cations have on the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells that incorporate [Ru(dmb)(2)(dcbH)](2+) sensitizers, where dmb is 4,4'-dimethyl-2,2'-bipyridine and dcbH is 4,4'-dicarboxylic acid-2,2'-bipyridine was examined. Simulations suggest that an enhanced photocurrent occurs in the presence of lithium cations, which is attributed to the photochemical generation of an excited-state dye lithium adduct. In this adduct, a lithium cation is interacting with the carbonyl moieties of the dcbH ligands, which results in a bathochromic shift of the [Ru(dmb)(2)(dcbH)](2+) metal-to-ligand charge-transfer spectral band. This shift in absorption can be canceled by introducing a hypothetical dipolar electric field of 7.3 MV/cm, in good agreement with experimentally reported values for Stark effects observed under solar excitation of TiO2 functionalized with these types of sensitizer molecules. This indicates that lithium cations not only interact with the metal-oxide semiconductor, as shown previously, but also interact directly with the dye upon photoexcitation, something that should be considered when designing and evaluating new sensitizers.

Four sensitizers (AP6, AP8, AP9, and AP12) have been synthesized and fully characterized via UV-Vis absorption, cyclic voltammetry, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC), and in dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) devices. Structural modifications to both the donor and acceptor/anchor regions were evaluated via structure-property relationships without altering the quinoxaline pi-bridge. Through careful dye design, a broadly absorbing near-infrared (NIR) sensitizer extending electricity production to 800 nm is realized in DSC devices. Ground- and excited-state oxidation potentials were measured to show energetically favorable charge transfer events. Importantly, the dye structure was found to have a strong influence on dye energetics in different environments with structural elements allowing for either similar or dramatically different solution versus film measurements. The DSC device electrolyte was also found to have a significant influence on dye energetics as well. Electron transfer events were probed for each dye with DSC device measurements and with TCSPC studies. The results are correlated to the dye structures.

With the use of quantum dots (QD), exciton transfer facilitators (Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester-PCBM) and Poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl-P3HT), and careful preparation of the TiO2 oxide layer deposited on the carbon fiber working electrode, an optimized efficiency of 7.6% was obtained. Carbon nanotube yarn (CNTY) was used to prepare both the working and counter electrodes of the fabricated cells. TiCl4 annealing of the TiO2 layer was carried out and the resulting oxide layer morphology was found to be very uniform. The quantum dots, cadmium sulfide (CdS) and cadmium selenide (CdSe), were deposited directly onto the surface of the nanoporous oxide layer using chemical bath deposition (CBD). Also, the P3HT and PCBM were applied and deposited via CBD on the working electrode as a bulk heterojunction material. Potentiometric characterization of the prepared cells performed at different cell lengths and showed that the maximum efficiency was obtained for cells approximately 3.5 cm in length. Photovoltaic performance of these solid state three dimensional cells was also carried out for different cell configurations.	[Grissom, Glenn; Jaksik, Jared; Aishee, Sayeeda T.

Interfacial electron transfer yields in dye-sensitized NiO photocathodes correlated to excited-state dipole orientation of ruthenium chromophores	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Gordon Research Conference on Electron Donor Acceptor Interactions (GRC - EDAI)	AUG 07-12, 2016	Slave Regina Univ, Newport, RI		Slave Regina Univ	ruthenium; photocathode; interface dynamics; electron transfer	TRANSITION-METAL COMPOUNDS; SOLAR-CELLS; ABSORPTION-SPECTROSCOPY; CONVERSION EFFICIENCY; CHARGE RECOMBINATION; TRANSFER DYNAMICS; ANCHORING GROUP; VISIBLE-LIGHT; COMPLEXES; TIO2	Interface dynamics of nanocrystalline NiO thin films sensitized with two ruthenium polypyridyl chromophores have been investigated to examine the influence that excited-state dipole orientation and the position of the bipyridine radical formed in the charge-separated state have on interfacial electron transfer yields. In ultrafast transient absorption experiments, the charge separated state is observed on the nanosecond timescale for the trifluoromethyl-substituted chromophore, [Ru(flpy)(2)(dcb)](2+) (flpy = 4,4'-bis(trifluoromethyl)-2,2'-bipyridine, dcb = 4,4'-dicarboxy-2,2'-bipyridine), but not for [Ru(bpy)(2)(dcb)](2+) (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine). Differences are attributed to the positioning of the bipyridine radical formed in the charge separated state; for [Ru(flpy)(2)(dcb)](2+), the electron is localized on the flpy ligand distal to the surface, whereas for [Ru(bpy)(2)(dcb)](2+), the electron is localized on the dcb ligand, proximal to the NiO surface. Enhanced photovoltaic performance is observed for dye-sensitized solar cell devices prepared with [Ru(flpy)(2)(dcb)](2+), demonstrating that enhanced charge separation can be correlated with device efficiency.

However, how the ALD layer affects the interfacial structure of adsorbed molecules and interfacial electron transfer dynamics is still unclear. Herein, we investigated the effects of ALD of Al2O3 on adsorption structure of Re bipyridyl complex on TiO2 nanocrystalline films and rutile (0 0 1) single crystals by IR absorption and sum frequency generation spectroscopy. Further, the electron transfer dynamics between the Re complex and TiO2 film was also examined by ultrafast infrared transient absorption spectroscopy. Our results show that the electron injection yield decreases with the increase of ALD layer thickness. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study focuses on understanding the effect of aprotic solvents on the injection rate. Transient absorption at 1900 cm(-1) is probed following a 400 nm pulse which excites the electronic transition of p-ER adsorbed on TiO2 through its carboxylic group. Measurements conducted in three different solvents show that electron injection lifetimes are in the 250-300 fs range but display a trend in correlation with solvent polarity: the electron injection lifetime is the shortest (257 fs) in acetonitrile followed by dichloromethane (271 fs) and chloroform (296 fs). This trend can be understood by using the Marcus theory in which the reorganization energy varies correspondingly in the three different solvents. This study shows that for aprotic solvents the one with the highest polarity facilitates the fastest electron injection. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Two zinc(II) porphyrin (ZnP)-based PSs were used to examine the effect of panchromatic sensitization on the photocatalytic H-2 generation. A dyad molecular design was used to construct a difluoro boron-dipyrromethene (bodipy)-conjugated ZnP PS (ZnP-dyad), whereas the other one featured an electron-donating diarylamino moiety (YD2-o-C8). To probe the use of the ZnP scaffold in this particular energy conversion process, an organic PS without the ZnP moiety (Bodipy-dye) was also synthesized for comparison. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy was adopted to map out the energy transfer processes occurring in the dyad and to establish the bodipy-based antenna effect. In particular, the systems with YD2-o-C8 and ZnP-dyad achieved a remarkable initial activity for the production of H-2 with an initial turnover frequency (TOFi) higher than 300 h(-1) under white light irradiation. The use of ZnP PSs in dye-sensitized photocatalysis for the H-2 evolution reaction in this study indicated the importance of the panchromatic sensitization capability for the development of light absorbing PSs.

In situ infrared study of photo-generated electrons and adsorbed species on nitrogen-doped TiO2 in dye-sensitized solar cells	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							PHOTOCATALYTIC OXIDATION; NANOCRYSTALLINE TIO2; BAND-GAP; RECOMBINATION; EFFICIENCY; PERFORMANCE; DIFFUSION; IMPEDANCE; ETHANOL; OXYGEN	Charge transfer between adsorbed dyes and the TiO2 surface plays a key role in controlling the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The lack of understanding of charge transfer steps has hindered further development of DSSCs and many solar energy conversion devices/processes. In this study, we used in situ infrared spectroscopy to investigate electron transfer and photo-electric energy conversion processes at the interface, i.e., surface hydroxyls, adsorbed species, as well as the dynamics of photo-generated electrons in TiO2 and N-TiO2 in DSSCs. Nitrogen (N-) doping of TiO2 blocked linear OH, giving more hydrophobic surface characteristics than undoped TiO2. N-Doping further increased the electron-hole separation caused by solar light on the working electrode and the current density in the DSSC. In situ infrared (IR) studies revealed that N-doping facilitated the electron transfer from the N719 dye (di-tetrabutylammonium cis-bis(isothiocyanato) bis(2,2-bipyridyl-4,4-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II)) to the conduction band in TiO2, reducing the impedance in the DSSC. Probing N-TiO2 with adsorbed ethanol showed that shallow traps in N-TiO2 can be accessed by electrons from adsorbed ethanol. Electron transfer from the N719 dye is significantly faster than that from adsorbed ethanol which involves C-H bond breaking.	[Liu, Jiawei; Winwarid, Piyapong; Chuang, Steven S.

Here, we have successfully explored three tris(4-alkoxyphenyl)-amine mediators with bulky molecular structures and generated more effective tandem redox systems. This series of tandem redox electrolytes rendered solar cells with very high photovoltages exceeding 1 V, which approaches the theoretical voltage limit of tris(bipyridine)cobalt-based electrolytes. Solar cells with power conversion efficiencies of 9.7-11.0% under 1 sun illumination were manufactured. This corresponds to an efficiency improvement of up to 50% as compared to solar cells based on pure tris(bipyridine)cobalt-based electrolytes. The photovoltage increases with increasing steric effects of the tris(4-alkoxyphenyl)amine mediators, which is attributed to a retarded recombination kinetics. These results highlight the importance of structural design for optimized charge transfer at the sensitized semiconductor/electrolyte interface and provide insights for the future development of efficient dye-sensitized solar cells.

The effects were analyzed and compared with standard untreated devices. A significant increase in short circuit current density was observed by employing a step-by-step heating method for dye solution in DSSCs. This increase of J (sc) is attributed to the enhancement in dye adsorption by the surface of the semiconductor and the higher number of charge carriers generated. DSSCs fabricated by a heated dye solution have achieved an overall power conversion efficiency of 8.41% which is significantly higher than the efficiency of 7.31% achieved with DSSCs fabricated without heated dye. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and capacitance voltage studies were performed to understand the better performance of the device fabricated with heated dye. Furthermore, transient photocurrent and transient photovoltage measurements were also performed to gain an insight into interfacial charge carrier recombinations.

A fluorescence trajectory is thus spread into segments of the multiple scans, which advances an efficient data recovery not only over limited photon-cycles but a frequently blinking trajectory owing to the innate heterogeneity present in a single-molecule environment.

MR-3 and MR-4 displayed PCE of 4.54% and 2.38%, respectively. Furthermore, MR-3 co-sensitized with NCSU-10 exhibited improved efficiency of 9.09% than NCSU alone (8.74%). One of the merits in the studied structure motif D---A was modulating the molecular geometry of the sensitizers and eliminating the steric effect between the donor and -spacer (terthiophene) to furnish a coplanar molecular structure and to maximize electronic conjugation. In addition, coupling-steric effect precludes effective conjugation and reduces light harvesting as it increases the band gap. To eliminate the steric effect of the aryl moiety at ortho position of 2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl donor, another conjugated spacer, alkene (CH?CH), was inserted between the donor and the -spacer (terthiophene), which maximized the electron conjugation throughout the coplanar system; the optimized molecular geometry of the dyes was calculated using DFT. Another molecular geometry feature that was studied was the influence of different anchoring groups on coplanarity of the dye structure and consequently the photovoltaic performance. In the case of MR-3, where the anchoring group is based on the cyanoacrylic group, the optimized geometry was found coplanar. However, when rhodanine moiety was used as an anchoring group, the calculated optimized geometry of the dye (MR-4) was not coplanar, which resulted in weak electronic coupling and inferior electronic injection into TiO2 conduction band edge. The inter-relationship between the optimized geometry of the dyes and their photovoltaic performance is discussed.

They were screened rationally through different computational approaches to explore their potential applications as photosensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Compelling photophysical properties such as electron injection driving force, electron injection time, and dye regeneration were studied for the isolated dyes under the DFT and TD-DFT frameworks. Index of spatial extent (5, D, and Delta q), the strength of charge transfer and separation along with the charge transfer process is explored. First principle approach including van derWaa Is density functional calculation of dye@TiO2 interface indicates that all of the designed dyes have optimal interfacial behavior. Bader charge analysis, partial density of state (PDOS), charge density and electrostatic potential difference calculation confirms that THQ7 and THQ9 are the most efficient dye-sensitizers. The other five designed dyes also possess the required properties to emerge as effective dye-sensitizers potentially better than those already utilized.

Herein, it is the first time to report a core-shell structured amorphous Fe-B alloy coupled with metal Fe nanoclusters as an efficient HER catalyst. The composite was fabricated via the transformation of the FeOOH coating on amorphous Fe-B alloy into metal Fe through a simple photoreduction approach. The Fe nanoclusters loaded on amorphous Fe-B alloy improve the catalytic HER. Thus, the as-prepared composite exhibits much better electrocatalytic and photocatalytic HER activities than single Fe and Fe-B alloy, that is, there is a synergic effect between Fe metal and amorphous Fe-B alloy. The highest apparent quantum yield (AQY) for photocatalytic HER reaches 34% at 470 nm with Eosin Y as a photosensitizer. The composite cocatalyst can be recovered by a magnetic field after the dye-sensitized photocatalytic HER. More interestingly, the electrocatalytic HER activity of Fe-B@Fe-10 in alkaline solution surpasses that of foam Ni used in industrial water electrolysis, and the core-shell composite shows excellent HER performance at high current density. The findings provide new insights to develop efficient and stable noble-metal-free HER catalysts.

J	Hamblin, MR				Hamblin, Michael R.			Upconversion in photodynamic therapy: plumbing the depths	DALTON TRANSACTIONS			English	Review							IN-VIVO; PHOTOCATALYTIC DISINFECTION; DRUG-DELIVERY; NANOPARTICLES; NANOPLATFORM; TUMOR; NIR; PHOTOSENSITIZERS; PHOTOACTIVATION; NANOTRANSDUCERS	Photodynamic therapy (PDT) involves the combination of non-toxic dyes called photosensitizers (PS) and harmless visible light that interact with ambient oxygen to give reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can damage biomolecules and kill cells. PDT has mostly been developed as a cancer therapy but can also be used as an antimicrobial approach against localized infections. However even the longest wavelength used for exciting PS (in the 700 nm region) has relatively poor tissue penetration, and many PS are much better excited by blue and green light. Therefore upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) have been investigated in order to allow deeper-penetrating near-infrared light (980 nm or 810 nm) to be used for PDT. NaYF4 nanoparticles doped with Yb3+ and Er3+ or with Tm3+ and Er3+ have been attached to PS either by covalent conjugation, or by absorption to the coating or shell (used to render the UCNPs biocompatible). Forster resonance energy transfer to the PS then allows NIR light energy to be transduced into ROS leading to cell killing and tumor regression. Some studies have experimentally demonstrated the deep tissue advantage of UCNP-PDT. Recent advances have included dye-sensitized UCNPs and UCNPs coupled to PS, and other potentially synergistic drug molecules or techniques. A variety of bioimaging modalities have also been combined with upconversion PDT. Further studies are necessary to optimize the drug-delivery abilities of the UCNPs, improve the quantum yields, allow intravenous injection and tumor targeting, and ensure lack of toxicity at the required doses before potential clinical applications.

Iodine binding with thiophene and furan based dyes for DSCs	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							SENSITIZED SOLAR-CELLS; REGENERATION MECHANISMS; CHARGE RECOMBINATION; ORGANIC-DYES; COMPLEXES	Iodine binding to thiophene rings in dyes for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) has been hypothesized to be performance degrading in a number of literature cases. Binding of iodine to dyes near the semiconductor surface can promote undesirable electron transfers and lower the overall efficiency of devices. Six thiophene or furan containing dye analogs were synthesized to analyze iodine binding to the dyes via Raman spectroscopy, UV-Vis studies, device performance metrics and density functional theory (DFT) based computations. Evidence suggests I-2 binds thiophene-based dyes stronger than furan-based dyes. This leads to higher DSC device currents and voltages from furan analogues, and longer electron lifetimes in DSC devices using furan based dyes. Raman spectrum of the TiO2 surface-bound dyes reveals additional and more instense peaks for thiophene dyes in the presence of I-2 relative to no I-2. Additionally, broader and shifted UV-Vis peaks are observed for thiophene dyes in the presence of I-2 on TiO2 films suggesting significant interaction between the dye molecules and I-2. These observations are also supported by DFT and TD-DFT calculations which indicate the absence of a key geometric energy minimum in the dye-I-2 ground state for furan dyes which are readily observed for the thiophene based analogues.

In this work, carbon-TiO2 hybrid dots in two different structural configurations were prepared and investigated comparatively for their optical properties and photoinduced redox characteristics, and the results suggested major differences. In the configuration of small carbon nanoparticles each coated/doped with only a small amount of TiO2, the TiO2 played the role of enhancing the surface passivation effect in conjunction with organic surface functionalization agents for the hybrid dots to exhibit a much improved performance over that of their corresponding neat carbon dots. In the other configuration, however, the hybrid dots of TiO2 nanocrystals each composited with nanoscale carbon domains were apparently similar to dye-sensitized TiO2 nanoparticle systems, with the carbon domains providing the dye function for the harvesting of visible photons. While combining nanoscale carbon and TiO2 for various applications has been a popular topic in the recent literature, the results reported here provide new insights into the different structural configurations or arrangements between the carbon and TiO2 and their associated effects on the optical and photoinduced redox properties of the hybrid nanostructures. Significant implications of the results on an understanding of the mechanistic relationships between the hybrid nano-structures/configurations and optical/redox properties are highlighted, and opportunities in the further exploration of carbon-metal oxide hybrid dots and their applications are discussed.

Fundamental Factors Impacting the Stability of Phosphonate-Derivatized Ruthenium Polypyridyl Sensitizers Adsorbed on Metal Oxide Surfaces	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						electrochemistry; phosphonate; sensitizer; ruthenium; stability; photoelectrosynthesis; dye-sensitized; interfaces	INTERFACIAL ELECTRON-TRANSFER; ATOMIC LAYER DEPOSITION; SOLAR-ENERGY CONVERSION; CHROMOPHORE-CATALYST ASSEMBLIES; WATER-OXIDATION; SEMICONDUCTOR SURFACES; DYE; TIO2; CELLS; COMPLEXES	A series of 18 ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes were synthesized and evaluated under electrochemically oxidative conditions, which generates the Ru(III) oxidation state and mimics the harsh conditions experienced during the kinetically limited regime that can occur in dyesensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and dye-sensitized photoelectrosynthesis cells, to further develop fundamental insights into the factors governing molecular sensitizer surface stability in aqueous 0.1 M HClO4 . Both desorption and oxidatively induced ligand substitution were observed on planar fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrodes, with a dependence on the E-1/2 Ru(III/II) redox potential dictating the comparative ratios of the processes. Complexes such as RuP4OMe (E-1/2 = 0.91 vs Ag/AgCl) displayed virtually only desorption, while complexes such as RuPbpz (E-1/(2) > 1.62 V vs Ag/AgCl) displayed only chemical decomposition. Comparing isomers of 4,4'- and 5,5'-disubstituted-2,2'-bipyridine ancillary ligands, a dramatic increase in the rate of desorption of the Ru(III) complexes was observed for the 5,5'-ligands. Nanoscopic indium-doped tin oxide thin films (nanolTO) were also sensitized and analyzed with cyclic voltammetry, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, and Xray photoelectron spectroscopy, allowing for further distinction of desorption versus ligand-substitution processes. Desorption loss to bulk solution associated with the planar surface of FTO is essentially non-existent on nanolTO, where both desorption and ligand substitution are shut down with RuP4OMe. These results revealed that minimizing time spent in the oxidized form, incorporating electron-donating groups, maximizing hydrophobicity, and minimizing molecular bulk near the adsorbed ligand are critical to optimizing the performance of ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes in dye-sensitized devices.

Dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical water oxidation through a buried junction	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						water oxidation; dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cell; solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell; artificial photosynthesis; dual working electrode	METAL-OXIDE SURFACES; SOLAR-CELLS; PHOTOANODES; CATALYST; LIGHT; ELECTRODES; DEPOSITION; CONVERSION; COMPLEXES; DEVICE	Water oxidation has long been a challenge in artificial photosynthetic devices that convert solar energy into fuels. Water-splitting dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells (WS-DSPECs) provide a modular approach for integrating light-harvesting molecules with water-oxidation catalysts on metal-oxide electrodes. Despite recent progress in improving the efficiency of these devices by introducing good molecular water-oxidation catalysts, WS-DSPECs have poor stability, owing to the oxidation of molecular components at very positive electrode potentials. Here we demonstrate that a solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell (ss-DSSC) can be used as a buried junction for stable photoelectrochemical water splitting. A thin protecting layer of TiO2 grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) stabilizes the operation of the photoanode in aqueous solution, although as a solar cell there is a performance loss due to increased series resistance after the coating. With an electrodeposited iridium oxide layer, a photocurrent density of 1.43 mA cm(-2) was observed in 0.1 M pH 6.7 phosphate solution at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, with good stability over 1 h. We measured an incident photon-to-current efficiency of 22% at 540 nm and a Faradaic efficiency of 43% for oxygen evolution. While the potential profile of the catalyst layer suggested otherwise, we confirmed the formation of a buried junction in the as-prepared photoelectrode. The buried junction design of ss-DSSs adds to our understanding of semiconductor-electrocatalyst junction behaviors in the presence of a poor semiconducting material.

Interestingly, the ZTO NPs exhibited band edge emission in the mid UVA region and as a result possibility of enhanced light harvesting in the terminal UVA region was anticipated in the device due to the efficient energy transfer observed in case of the sensitizer N719 than N3. The dye sensitization property has been found to be higher for the N3 dye molecules than the N719 dye molecules as based on the time dependent dye loading study. The devices fabricated with ZTO-N719 exhibited improved photovoltaic performance compared to the ZTO-N3 based devices exhibiting an overall conversion efficiency of 2.56% by the former compared to the later (1.90%) under 1SUN 1.5AM illumination and sensitization for 12 h.

Here, design principles are developed for p-block heteroatom-doped graphene as efficient IRR catalysts through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The descriptors based on the intrinsic properties of dopant elements are identified to establish a quantitative relationship that correlates the doped structures to catalytic activities. Moreover, a quantitative relationship is also established between the catalytic performance and the extrinsic factors such as the number of exposed active sites for a particular mass loading. It is predicted that most p-block element doped graphene catalysts have better performance than Pt, and that doping at graphene edges enhances catalytic activities. These predictions are consistent with experimental results. The proposed design principles enable us to rationally design and search for highly active catalysts based on earth-abundant, cost-effective materials.

Fundamental Aspects of Photoinduced Charge Flow at a Quantum Dot-Sensitized Single-Crystal TiO2 Semiconductor Interface	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							ELECTRON-TRANSFER; CDSE; NANOCRYSTALS; DYNAMICS; COLLECTION; DEPENDENCE; INJECTION; LIFETIMES; SURFACES; ANATASE	The fundamental aspects of charge transfer from photoexcited CdSe quantum dots to a single crystal of TiO2, a wide band gap metal oxide semiconductor, were investigated and compared with that of a dye-sensitized system in relation to the operation of quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Due to the stark differences in both physical and electronic properties of quantum dots versus molecular dyes, it was hypothesized that the fundamental behavior of the two systems could differ greatly. The large size and surface area of the quantum dots relative to molecular dyes present the possibility for the positively charged hole to move a greater distance away from the QD/oxide interface during the electron injection process. This increased distance influences the Coulombic interaction between the trapped hole and injected electron, leading to differences and increased complexity of the recombination pathways when compared to the dye system.

Improving the Efficiency of the Mn2+3+ Couple in Quantum Dot Solar Cells: The Role of Spin Crossover	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							COMPLEX REDOX SHUTTLES; OPEN-CIRCUIT VOLTAGE; COUNTER-ELECTRODE; PARAMAGNETIC-SUSCEPTIBILITY; COBALT COMPLEX; CYCLIC VOLTAMMETRY; CDSE NANOCRYSTALS; TIO2 FILMS; RECOMBINATION; COMPOSITE	In this study, we present the synthesis of a family of first-row transition metal redox mediators based on the bis[hydrotris(pyrazolyl)]borate manganese(II/III) (MnTp(2)) redox couple. Using cyclic voltammetry, the electrochemical properties and characteristic spin crossover inherent in this class of metal complexes were analyzed. From the electrochemical analysis the standard heterogeneous rate constant (k(s,h)) was estimated. These constants were 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than other outer-sphere redox couples, such as Co(bpy)(3)(2+/3+) with k(s,h) values decreasing from 6.39 (+/- 0.7) x 10(-3) cm/s in Co(bpy)(3) to 1.60 (+/- 0.3) X 10(-5) cm/s in bis[hydrotris(4-ethylpyrazolyl)]borate manganese(II/III). It was theorized that the drastic reduction in the rate of electron transfer could be used to increase the lifetimes of the injected electrons in quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs). Indeed, this was found to be the case with the slope of open-circuit voltage decay measurements being an order of magnitude lower in the Mn-based redox couples, compared to Co(bpy)(3) when using cells prepared under the same conditions. This increase led us to then focus on optimizing the electrolyte solvent to assess the current-voltage characteristics of cells prepared using the MnTp(2) family of redox mediators. These cells displayed enhanced power conversion efficiencies when compared to Co(bpy)(3) despite poor diffusion throughout the nanostructured TiO2 film. Analysis of the quenching rate constant via Stern-Volmer quenching analysis suggested that the MnTp(2) family of redox mediators possesses an adequate ability to regenerate the quantum dot sensitizer, with values of kg being on similar orders of magnitude as other Co- and Cu-based redox couples employed in dye-sensitized solar cells. Ultimately, it was concluded that the increase in the lifetime of the injected electron, working in concert with increased open-circuit voltage potentials, was the source of the significantly improved power conversion efficiencies.

Electric Fields Detected on Dye-Sensitized TiO2 Interfaces: Influence of Electrolyte Composition and Ruthenium Polypyridyl Anchoring Group Type	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							INTERVALENCE CHARGE-TRANSFER; FLAT-BAND POTENTIALS; SOLAR-CELLS; EXCITED-STATE; SPECTROSCOPIC DETERMINATION; PROTON-TRANSFER; COMPLEXES; ACID; ELECTROABSORPTION; BEHAVIOR	Electric fields at the dye-sensitized interface of anatase TiO2 nanocrystallites interconnected in a mesoporous thin film are reported using carboxylic acid-derivatized and phosphonic acid-derivatized ruthenium polypyridyl complexes. Systematic investigations with [Ru(dtb)(2)(dpb)](PF6)(2), where dtb is 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine and dpb is 4,4'-bis-(PO3H2)-2,2'-bipyridine, were carried out in conjunction with its carboxylic acid structural analogue. Electric fields attributed to cation adsorption were measured from a bathochromic (red) shift of the sensitizers UV-visible absorption spectra upon replacement of neat acetonitrile solution with metal cation perchlorate acetonitrile electrolyte. Electric fields attributed to TiO2 electrons were measured from the hypsochromic (blue) shift of the absorption spectra upon electrochemical reduction of the sensitized TiO2 thin films. Electric fields, induced by either cation adsorption or electrochemically populated electrons, increase in magnitude following the same general cation-dependent trend (Na+ < Li+ < Ca2+ <= Mg2+ < Al3+), regardless of the sensitizers anchoring group type. For the first time, surface electric fields in the presence of trivalent cations (i.e., Al3+) were measured using [Ru(dtb)(2)(dpb)](PF6)(2). The magnitude of electric fields detected by the carboxylic acid sensitizer was 3 times greater than that detected by the phosphonic acid structural analogue under the same experimental conditions. The influence of protons and water in the acetonitrile electrolyte was also quantified. The added water was found to decrease the electric field, whereas protons had a very similar influence as did metal cations.

Tautomerization of the starting pyrazinacene due to the presence of a reduced pyrazine ring contained within an octaazatetracene chromophore led to mixtures of isomers, and factors affecting the relative yields of these isomers were considered. Isomer population can be described by a two-step reaction model where initial N-alkylation affects the reactivity of the remaining nitrogen atoms available for subsequent alkylation. A discrete soluble non-isomerizable phenanthroline-fused pyrazinacene was also prepared and the activity of its Ru(bpy)(2) complex as a photosensitizer for dye-sensitized solar cell application was investigated.

Modulation of N3 and N719 dye center dot center dot center dot TiO2 Interfacial Structures in Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells As Influenced by Dye Counter Ions, Dye Deprotonation Levels, and Sensitizing Solvent	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						DSC dyes; N3; N719; pH value; structure; orientation; packing density	NANOCRYSTALLINE TIO2; AB-INITIO; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; ADSORPTION GEOMETRY; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; BLACK DYE; PHOTOSENSITIZERS; ORIENTATION; PERFORMANCE; POTENTIALS	The fabrication process for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) is well-established; yet, reported reliabilities of DSC device photovoltaic properties have been the subject of widespread controversy. The fabrication process will naturally affect these device properties, wherein the most susceptible DSC device component is its working electrode, which comprises a dye center dot center dot center dot TiO2 interface. While various analytical chemistry methods have probed this fabrication process indirectly, the molecular structure of this interface has not been tracked with varying dye sensitization conditions, via any direct means. Little is thus known about how steric and electronic factors associated with dye counterions, dye deprotonation levels, and the choice of sensitizing solvent impact upon the nature by which the dye center dot center dot center dot TiO2 interfacial structure forms via self-assembly. This work employs X-ray reflectometry (XRR) in combination with density functional theory calculations to probe the structural nature of dye center dot center dot center dot TiO2 interfaces featuring the ruthenium-based dye cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2'-bipyridyl-4,4'-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II) (N3), and its doubly deprotonated derivative ditetrabutylammonium cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2'-bipyridy1-4,4'-dicarboxylato)-ruthenium(II) (N719). XRR measurements show that N3 and N719 dye center dot center dot center dot TiO2 interfaces, sensitized using the co-solvent MeCN:t-BuOH (1:1, v/v) exhibit the same preferred bidentate binding mode, although minor structural variations were observed owing to the co-adsorption of tetrabutylammonium counterions in the case of N719. Further XRR studies on N3-adsorbed TiO2 surfaces sensitized using different solvents, MeCN:t-BuOH (1:1, v/v), EtOH:t-BuOH (1:1, v/v), EtOH, and DMSO, showed that the nature of dye center dot center dot center dot TiO2 adsorption binding modes depends not only on the acidity of the N3-containing solutions, which dictate the dye deprotonation levels, but also on the steric nature of the sensitizing solvent.

They exhibit moderate overall efficiencies of power conversion that can be increased by improving the light-harvesting capacity of the organic dyes. Here, we report the synthesis, structural and electronic properties of two novel dyes based on perylene imides PI-1 and PI-2 as well as their application in DSSCs. In our design, design triphenylamine electron donors were linked to perylene-3,4,9,10- tetracarboxylic dianhydride derivative. The new dyes showed a broad absorption spectrum in the visible region as well as a strong push-pull electronic interaction determined computationally. Photovoltaic values for these dyes were not higher than previously reported compounds based on perylenes, with the best photovoltaic performance observed for the DSSCs based on PI-2, with an overall conversion efficiency of 1.3% under AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm(-2)). Although the electron transport to the TiO2 surface for PI-1 and PI-2 was not efficient enough to result in a high photovoltaic behavior, our design has afforded dyes exhibiting a more efficient light capture in the visible region.

Understanding the factors controlling the surface orientation of sensitizing organic molecules will aid in the improvement of both traditional DSSCs and other devices that integrate molecular linkers at interfaces. Here, we describe a general approach to understand relative dye-substrate orientation and provide analytical expressions predicting orientation. We consider the effects of substrate, solvent, and protonation state on dye molecule orientation. In the absence of solvent, our model predicts that most carboxylic acid-functionalized molecules prefer to fie flat (parallel) on the surface, due to van der Waals interactions, as opposed to a tilted orientation with respect to the surface that is favored by covalent bonding of the carboxylic acid group to the substrate. When solvation effects are considered, however, the molecules are predicted to orient perpendicular to the surface. We extend this approach to help understand and guide the orientation of metal-organic framework (MOF) thin-film growth on various metal-oxide substrates. A two-part analytical model is developed on the basis of the results of DFT calculations and ab initio MD simulations that predicts the binding energy of a molecule by chemical and dispersion forces on rutile and anatase TiO2, surfaces, and quantifies the dye solvation energy for two solvents. The model is in good agreement with the DFT calculations and enables rapid prediction of dye molecule and MOF linker binding preference on the basis of the size of the adsorbing molecule, identity of the surface, and the solvent environment. We establish the threshold molecular size, governing dye molecule orientation, for each condition.

Controlling Vertical and Lateral Electron Migration Using a Bifunctional Chromophore Assembly in Dye-Sensitized Photoelectrosynthesis Cells	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							PERYLENE BISIMIDE DYES; WATER OXIDATION; SEMICONDUCTOR INTERFACES; HYDROGEN EVOLUTION; HOLE TRANSPORT; SOLAR-CELLS; THIN-FILMS; OXIDE; CATALYST; TIO2	Integration of photoresponsive chromophores that initiate multistep catalysis is essential in dye-sensitized photoelectrosynthesis cells and related devices. We describe here an approach that incorporates a chromophore assembly surface-bound to metal oxide electrodes for light absorption with an overlayer of catalysts for driving the half-reactions of water splitting. The assembly is a combination of a core-twisted perylene diimide and a ruthenium polypyridyl complex. By altering the connection sequence of the two subunits in the assembly, in their surface-binding to either TiO2 or NiO, the assembly can be tuned to convert visible light into strongly oxidizing equivalents for activation of an electrodeposited water oxidation catalyst (NiCo2Ox) at the photoanode, or reducing equivalents for activation of an electrodeposited water reduction catalyst (Nio(0.05)S(x)) at the photocathode. A key element in the design of the photoelectrodes comes from the synergistic roles of the vertical (interlayer) charge transfer and lateral (intralayer) charge hopping in determining overall cell efficiencies for photoelectrocatalysis.

ZnO nanosheets photoanodes on Ti foil substrates were first prepared with hydrothermal synthesis method, on which ZnO nanoparticles and microspheres were deposited by using chemical bath deposition method. The corresponding photoanodes were assembled into flexible dye-sensitized solar cells (FDSSCs). Effect of Ti foil substrates pretreatment methods and chemical bath deposition process on the properties of ZnO thin films and devices were mainly studied. Phase composition and morphology of Ti foil substrates and ZnO films were characterized with XRD, SEM and TEM. J-V curves of the FDSSCs were tested by solar simulator and Keithley 2400. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also carried out to analyze the internal electronic transmission. The results show that when the Ti foil substrates were treated by using acid polishing, and the ZnO nanosheets were modified for 5 h by immersing in 0.15 mol/L methanol solution of zinc acetate after preheat treatment for 24 h, the FDSSCs displayed optimum performance. Its short circuit current density, open circuit voltage, fill factor and photoelectric conversion efficiency were 11.26 mA/cm(2), 0.67 V, 0.60 and 4.51%, respectively.

The choice of metal ion can have a large impact on the stability, loading concentration, and other properties of the films. Here we report our investigation into the role of the linking ion on the subnanosecond excited state dynamics in the bilayer films (TiO2-B-M-RuP). While metal linkers like Cd-II, La-III, Sn-IV, Zn-II, and Zr-IV are photochemically inert, paramagnetic linking ions such as C-II, Fe-II, and Mn-II quench the excited state of the dye with a rate constant on the order of 10(8) s(-1). The absence of new spectral features in the transient absorption spectrum suggests that energy transfer, and not electron transfer, is responsible for the excited state quenching. On TiO2, the electron injection rate for TiO2-B-M-RuP is an order of magnitude slower (similar to 1 X 10(9) s(-1)) than for the dye directly on TiO2 (similar to 3 X 10(10) s(-1)) due to increased spatial separation and reduced electronic coupling between the dye and the surface. In dye-sensitized solar cells, the TiO2-B-M-RuP devices exhibit a notably lower J(sc) but higher V-oc compared to TiO2-RuP with even lower photocurrents for Cu-II, Fe-II, and Mn-II bilayers presumably at least in part due to competitive quenching of the excited state by the metal ion. The increases in V-oc are offset by the decrease in J(sc); thus, the overall efficiency of the bilayer devices is lower than the that of the parent, monolayer device.

A High-Voltage Molecular-Engineered Organic Sensitizer-Iron Redox Shuttle Pair: 1.4V DSSC and 3.3V SSM-DSSC Devices	ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION			English	Article						dye-sensitized solar cells; high voltage; molecular engineering; multijunction solar cells; redox shuttles	SOLAR-CELLS; SILYL-ANCHOR; EFFICIENT; DYES; PHOTOVOLTAGE; MEDIATORS; COMPLEX; DESIGN	The development of high voltage solar cells is an attractive way to use sunlight for solar-to-fuel devices, multijunction solar-to-electric systems, and to power limited-area consumer electronics. By designing a low-oxidation-potential organic dye (RR9)/redox shuttle (Fe(bpy)(3)(3+/2+)) pair for dye-sensitized solar-cell (DSSC) devices, the highest single device photovoltage (1.42V) has been realized for a DSSC not relying on doped TiO2. Additionally, Fe(bpy)(3)(3+/2+) offers a robust, readily tunable ligand platform for redox potential tuning. RR9 can be regenerated with a low driving force (190mV), and by utilizing the RR9/Fe(bpy)(3)(3+/2+) redox shuttle pair in a subcell for a sequential series multijunction (SSM)-DSSC system, one of the highest known three subcell photovoltage was attained for any solar-cell technology (3.34V, >1.0V per subcell).

In this work, Na@C was demonstrated as an excellent electrode material for capacitive deionization (CDI). In a three-electrode configuration system, the specific capacity of the Na@C electrodes can achieve 306.4 F/g at current density of 0.2 A/g in 1 M NaCl, which is higher than that (235.2 F/g) of activated carbon (AC) electrodes. Furthermore, a high electrosorption capacity of 8.75 mg g(-1) in 100 mg/L NaCl was obtained with the Na@C electrodes in a batch-mode capacitive deionization cell. It exceeds the electrosorption capacity (4.08 mg g(-1)) of AC electrodes. The Na@C electrode also showed a promising cycle stability. The excellent performance of Na@C electrode for capacitive deionization (CDI) can be attributed to its high electrical conductivity and large accessible surface area.

Typical ionic liquid properties include high thermal stabilities, negligible vapor pressures, wide liquidus ranges, broad electrochemical windows, and unique solvation properties. Furthermore, the potential combinations of cations and anions provide nearly unlimited chemical tunability.

Robust sensitizer-assisted platinized titanium dioxide in photocatalytic removal of 4-chlorophenol in water: Light tunable sensitizer	JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY A-CHEMISTRY			English	Article						4-Chlorophenol; Sensitized; Photocatalytic; Platinized TiO2; Visible light irradiation; Tunable	VISIBLE-LIGHT; HYDROGEN-PRODUCTION; TIO2; ABSORPTION; PHOTOREACTIVITY; DEGRADATION; MECHANISMS; GENERATION; COMPLEXES; CATALYSTS	The photodegradation of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) by using 3,3'-Pt(dcbpy)(bdt), 33Pt(bdt), sensitized platinized titanium dioxide, Pt-TiO2, under 420 nm light irradiation while bubbling O-2 has been studied in this research. The 84% degradation efficiency was reached in 3 h, and this efficiency was much better than that assisted by 4,4'-Pt(dcbpy)(bdt), 44Pt(bdt), under the same conditions using 420 nm light. The possible reason is due to the difference in UV-vis absorption spectra of these two dyes around 420 nm. The 33Pt(bdt) dye which has been first synthesized in this study and has the twisted geometry shows larger open circuit voltage, higher molar extinction coefficient of pi-pi* transition around 420 nm and much better in 4-CP photodegradation than its 4,4'-analogue under blue light. Under 580 nm light irradiation for 6 h, both 33Pt(bdt) and 44Pt(bdt) sensitized Pt-TiO2-catalyzed 4-CP degradation with O-2 bubbling could reach 94% photodegradation efficiency based on metal ligand charge transfer, MLCT, mechanism. Fluorescence quenching experiments have been carried out to affirm the enhanced photo induced charge separation and transmission during 33Pt(bdt)-assisted reaction. To our knowledge, this is the first time to show that under blue or yellow light irradiation dye-sensitized Pt-TiO2-catalyzed 4-CP degradations have different mechanisms and are tunable by light wavelength. Dye 33Pt(bdt) is more robust and better sensitizer in 4-CP degradation than 44Pt(bdt) under blue light. Thus, by the careful selection of light wavelength and using the robust dye, one can tune the system to efficiently harvest specific visible light for the photodegradation of small organic pollutants.

The promise of solution-processed Fe2GeS4 thin films in iron chalcogenide photovoltaics	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article							SENSITIZED SOLAR-CELLS; COUNTER ELECTRODE; SULFIDE; PYRITE	The olivine Fe2GeS4, featuring non-toxic elements, cost-effective synthesis, and suitable optoelectronic properties, recently emerged as a promising light-absorbing candidate. Fe2GeS4 precursor powders obtained via a simple solution-based process were converted to highly crystalline Fe2GeS4 powders upon a thermal treatment in controlled atmosphere. Thin films fabricated by dip coating in the Fe2GeS4 precursor dispersion and subjected to the same thermal treatment render high-purity Fe2GeS4 thin films with a band gap of 1.4 eV, measured by room-temperature photoluminescence. Using Fe2GeS4 thin films as the sole absorber in a solution-based solar cell, open-circuit voltages of 361 mV are observed, while the use of the Fe2GeS4 films as counter electrodes in dye-sensitized solar cell constructs enhances the overall power conversion efficiency of the cell by a factor of five. This is the first report of a photovoltaic device based on Fe2GeS4.

Buddie			Interface Engineering and its Effect on WO3-Based Photoanode and Tandem Cell	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						WO3; surface states; etching; passivation; tandem cell; solar water splitting	SOLAR WATER OXIDATION; HEMATITE PHOTOANODES; SPLITTING PERFORMANCE; WO3 PHOTOELECTRODES; SURFACE PASSIVATION; FACILE FABRICATION; OXYGEN-EVOLUTION; THIN-FILMS; FEOOH; OXIDE	During photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, the reactions occur on the surface of the photoelectrode. Therefore, the properties of the interfaces between the various components of the electrode (semiconductor/semiconductor, semiconductor/catalyst, or photoelectrode/electrolyte) affect the PEC performance of the composite material. Notably, surface trap states may hinder charge transfer and transport properties, and also cause Fermi pinning, affecting the quasi-Fermi level and onset potential under illumination, which may in turn influence the PEC performance of the corresponding tandem cells. In this study, plate-like WO3 array films prepared by an aqueous chemical growth method were employed to highlight the effect of interfacial properties on the performance of a WO3-based photoanode. The Mott Schottky and linear sweep voltammetry experiments prove the existence of surface trap states and Fermi pinning for pristine WO3, which are alleviated after an "etching" treatment and disappeared after surface passivation by a Ga2O3 layer. Both etching and passivation increase the oxygen evolution activity and the Faradaic efficiency for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). After loading a permeable catalyst (FeOOH), the photocurrent is further increased, and there is a synergistic effect between loading of the electrocatalyst with etching or passivation. The onset potentials of the samples follow the trends: etch-WO3/FeOOH < WO3/FeOOH <= WO3/Ga2O3/FeOOH < etch-WO3 < WO3 < WO3/Ga2O3, indicating that the interfacial properties have a significant effect on the PEC performance. Meanwhile, the modified WO3-based electrode was combined with a dye-sensitized solar cell to fabricate tandem cell, which showed 2.42-fold photocurrent density compared with the pristine WO3-based tandem cell.

The D-pi-A ullazine series demonstrates an unusually uniform-in-intensity panchromatic UV/Vis absorption spectrum throughout the visible region. This is in part due to the introduction of strong high-energy bands through incorporation of the ullazine building block as shown by computational analysis.

Active-site-enriched selenium-doped graphene (SeG) was crafted by ball-milling followed by high-temperature annealing to yield abundant edge sites and fully activated basal planes. The density of defects within SeG can be tuned by adjusting the annealing temperature. The sample synthesized at an annealing temperature of 900 degrees C exhibited a superior response to the I-3(-) reduction with a high conversion efficiency of 8.42%, outperforming the Pt reference (7.88%). Improved stability is also observed. DFT calculations showed the high catalytic activity of SeG over pure graphene is a result of the reduced ionization energy owing to incorporation of Se species, facilitating electron transfer at the electrode-electrolyte interface.

Complementing related theoretical studies, we employ a Green's function technique based on density functional theory to account for a fully semi infinite substrate of rutile TiO2(110). We address the effect of a core excitation enabling direct comparison with soft X-ray experiments. We find that room temperature fluctuations drastically improve the agreement with experimental lifetime measurements while the core-hole plays an important role shifting the spectra and reducing the electron vibrational coupling of the adsorbate states. Ultimately, the emerging resonance spectra highlight the role of the continuum of acceptor states in temperature broadened Voigt-type profiles.

In this work, we demonstrate a new inorganic sensitized solar cell based on ordered one-dimensional semiconductor nanorod arrays of TiO2/NiTiO3 (NTO) heterostructures prepared via a facile two-step hydrothermal approach. The semiconductor heterostructure arrays are highly desirable and promising for DSSCs because of their direct charge transport capability and slow charge recombination rate. The low-cost NTO inorganic semiconductor possesses an appropriate band gap that matches well with TiO2, which behaves like a "dye" to enable efficient light harvesting and fast electron hole separation. The solar cells constructed by the ordered TiO2/NTO heterostructure photoanodes show a significantly improved power conversion efficiency, high fill factor, and more promising, outstanding life stability. The present work will open up an avenue to design heterostructured inorganics for high-performance solar cells.

Their physical and electronic properties were calculated using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). These include molecular properties that are required to assess the feasibility of a dye to function in DSSCs: UV-vis absorption spectra, light harvesting efficiency (LHE), and driving forces of electron injection (Delta G(inj)). ME01, ME02, and ME04 are predicted to exhibit broad absorption optical spectra that cover the entire visible range, rendering these three dyes promising DSSC prospects. Device-relevant calculations on these three short-listed dyes and the parent dye C281 were then performed, whereupon the dye molecules were adsorbed onto anatase TiO2 surfaces to form the DSSC working electrode. Associated DSSC device characteristics of this dye center dot center dot center dot TiO2 interfacial structure were determined. These include the light-harvesting efficiency, the number of injected electrons, the electron-injection lifetime, and the quantum-energy alignment of the adsorbed dye molecule to that of its device components. In turn, these calculated parameters enabled the derivation of the DSSC device performance parameters: short-circuit current density, J(SC), incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency, IPCE, and open-circuit voltage, V-OC. Thus, we demonstrate a systematic ab initio approach to screen rationally designed D-A dyes with respect to their potential applicability in high-performance DSSC devices.

Originally, it is believed that they are exciton-based devices, similar to organic or dye-sensitized solar cells. However, the emergence of efficient planar devices as well as measurements of exciton binding energy in the range of 10-100 meV suggest that they may be free carrier-based. In this work, the free carrier model is confirmed by building graphene/perovskite Schottky barrier solar cells, analogous to conventional metal/semiconductor Schottky barrier solar cells. To address the challenges of building such devices, solution-processing techniques are extensively investigated for depositing perovskite films directly onto graphene in order to obtain an intimate contact between the graphene and perovskite. Interestingly, these graphene/perovskite Schottky barrier devices have reasonably good efficiencyup to 10.6%and short circuit current densities only slightly lower than control devices. Furthermore, devices with neither a hole transport layer nor an electron transport layers have power conversion efficiencies of up to 6%. These results provide convincing evidence supporting the free carrier model for methylammonium lead iodide perovskites and offer insights on potential alternative designs for perovskite solar cells.

Highly Active NiO Photocathodes for H2O2 Production Enabled via Outer-Sphere Electron Transfer	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							DYE-SENSITIZED NIO; HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; NANOSTRUCTURED NIO; H-2 EVOLUTION; SOLAR FUEL; WATER; KINETICS; OXIDE; DECOMPOSITION; CATALYST	Tandem dye-sensitized photoelectrosynthesis cells are promising architectures for the production of solar fuels and commodity chemicals. A key bottleneck in the development of these architectures is the low efficiency of the photocathodes, leading to small current densities. Herein, we report a new design principle for highly active photocathodes that relies on the outer-sphere reduction of a substrate from the dye, generating an unstable radical that proceeds to the desired product. We show that the direct reduction of dioxygen from dye-sensitized nickel oxide (NiO) leads to the production of H2O2. In the presence of oxygen and visible light, NiO photocathodes sensitized with commercially available porphyrin, coumarin, and ruthenium dyes exhibit large photocurrents (up to 400 mu A/cm(2)) near the thermodynamic potential for O-2/H2O2 in near-neutral water. Bulk photoelectrolysis of porphyrin-sensitized NiO over 24 h results in millimolar concentrations of H2O2 with essentially 100% faradaic efficiency. To our knowledge, these are among the most active NiO photocathodes reported for multiproton/multielectron transformations. The photoelectrosynthesis proceeds by initial formation of superoxide, which disproportionates to H2O2. This disproportionation-driven charge separation circumvents the inherent challenges in separating electron-hole pairs for photocathodes tethered to inner sphere electrocatalysts and enables new applications for photoelectrosynthesis cells.

The chemical oxidant (Br-2 or Br-3(-)) is formed during illumination at the photoanode and used as a sacrificial oxidant to drive a water oxidation catalyst (WOC), here demonstrated using [Ru(bda)(pic)(2)], (1; pic=picoline, bda=2,2-bipyridine-6,6-dicarboxylate). The photochemical oxidation of bromide produces a chemical oxidant with a potential of 1.09V vs. NHE for the Br-2/Br- couple or 1.05V vs. NHE for the Br-3(-)/Br- couple, which is sufficient to drive water oxidation at 1 (Ru-V/IV approximate to 1.0V vs. NHE at pH5.6). At pH5.6, using a 0.2m acetate buffer containing 40mm LiBr and the [Ru(4,4-PO3H2-bpy)(bpy)(2)](2+) (RuP2+, bpy=2,2-bipyridine) chromophore dye on a SnO2/TiO2 core-shell electrode resulted in a photocurrent density of around 1.2mAcm(-2) under approximately 1 Sun illumination and a Faradaic efficiency upon addition of 1 of 77% for oxygen evolution.

J	Wang, Q				Wang, Qiong			Fast Voltage Decay in Perovskite Solar Cells Caused by Depolarization of Perovskite Layer	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							IMPEDANCE SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; ELECTRON; EFFICIENCY; RECOMBINATION; HYSTERESIS; COLLECTION; CONVERSION; MECHANISM; TRANSPORT	The open-circuit voltage decay course in perovskite solar cells is studied in this work under the assistance of three techniques, i.e., electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, light intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy, and open-circuit voltage decay. In contrast to what is known in dye-sensitized solar cells, where V-oc decay is due to back transfer of electrons from the TiO2 conduction band to redox species in the electrolyte, we find that in perovskite solar cells, half of the voltage drop initially results from the fast depolarization of the perovskite layer. In other words, we observe that the polarization of perovskite film contributes to about half of the V-oc in the device. The loss of the other half of V-oc is found to be due to interfacial charge recombination.

Impressively, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) assembled with a CNA counter electrode (CE) achieved a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.28%, which exceeded that of the conventional platinum (Pt)-based DSSC (7.20%) under the same conditions. Furthermore, highly dispersed CoS2 nanoparticles endowed with excellent intrinsic catalytic activity were hydrothermally incorporated to form a CNA-supported CoS2 (CNA-CoS2) CE, which was due to the large number of catalytically active sites and sufficient connections between CoS2 and the CNA. The electrocatalytic ability and stability were systematically evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and Tafel polarization, which confirmed that the resultant CNA-CoS2 hybrid CE exhibited a remarkably higher electrocatalytic activity toward I-3(-) reduction, and faster ion diffusion and electron transfer than the pure CNA CE. Such cost-effective DSSCs assembled with an optimized CNA-CoS2 CE yielded an enhanced PCE of 8.92%, comparable to that of the cell fabricated with the CNA-Pt hybrid CE reported in our published literature (9.04%). These results indicate that the CNA-CoS2 CE can be considered as a promising candidate for Pt-free CEs used in low-cost and high-performance DSSCs.

Such strategies can only be systematic and successful if they are derived from knowledge-based paradigms that relate individual aspects of the molecular structure for a given class of dyes to their photovoltaic properties. The optical and electrochemical properties of these dyes were investigated experimentally by UV-vis absorption and emission spectroscopy, as well as cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations on these dyes complement these experiments. Among other results, this concerted experimental and computational study revealed that the dialkylaminophenyl moiety in these dyes exhibits a large twist as a result of its ground-to-excited-state optical transition. In particular, a near-perpendicular (88.98 degrees) twist of the dimethylaminophenyl moiety relative to the pi-bridging unit that connects the three aryl rings in 2 was observed upon formation of its photo-excited-state structure. Moreover, it was discovered that 2 affords the highest V-OC and power-conversion efficiency (PCE) values among these dyes. The particularly high PCE for 2 was found to be due to this twisting of the phenyl ring, which blocks the pathway of electrons from TiO2 to the donor, and hence suppresses undesirable electron recombination at the dye center dot center dot center dot TiO2 interface. This diode-like effect minimizes undesirable electron recombination effects and represents an unprecedented structure property relationship that should be useful for the molecular engineering of larger chromophores in this class of dyes for DSSC applications.

In view of the enhanced and/or diversified function of integrated devices, as compared with conventional devices with limited performance or sole applicability, many integrated power packs have been widely developed by combining different devices, such as a silicon solar cell (SSC), Cu(In,Ga)(Sn,Se)(2) (CIGS), organic solar cell (OSC), dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), perovskite solar cell (PSC), lithium-ion battery (LIB), nanogenerator (NG), supercapacitor (SC), photoelectrosynthetic cell (PESC), and electrolysis cell (ELC), into one unit. In this Review, with a particular emphasis on their recent advances, we cover the integrated solar cell device research in a broad sense and provide an overview of state-of-the-art progress on the integrated solar cell devices based on DSSC and PSC, such as DSSC/LIB, DSSC/SC, DSSC/NG, DSSC/LIB/NG, PSC/OSC, PSC/CIGS, PSC/PSC, PSC/SSC, SSC/SC, PSC/SC, OSC/SC, DSSC/PESC, PSC/PESC, and PSC/ELC, for energy harvesting and storage that are significantly important for self-powering systems and portable/wearable electronics. Finally, the challenges and future outlooks in this promising photovoltaic (PV) field are featured on the basis of current development.

In this new design, the electron rich carbazole unit was attached to three different electron withdrawing/anchoring species, viz. 4-amino benzoic acid, sulfanilic acid and barbituric acid. The dyes were characterized by spectral, photophysical and electrochemical analysis. Their optical and electrochemical parameters along with molecular geometries, optimized from DFT have been employed to apprehend the effect of the structures of these co-sensitizers on the photovoltaic performances. Further, S1-3 dyes were co-sensitized along with a well-known NCSU-10 dye in order to broaden the spectral response of the co-sensitized devices and hence improve the efficiency. The photovoltaic performance studies indicated that, the device fabricated using S-1 dye as co-sensitizer with 0.2 mM of NCSU-10 exhibited improved PCE of 9.55% with J(SC) of 22.85 mA cm(-2), V-OC of 0.672 V and FF of 62.2%, whereas the DSSC fabricated with dye NCSU-10 (0.2 mM) alone displayed PCE of 8.25% with J(SC) of 20.41 mA cm(-2), V-OC of 0.667 V and FF of 60.6%. Furthermore, electronic excitations simulated using time-dependent DFT, were in good agreement with the experimentally obtained results of the co-sensitizers, indicating that the exchange-correlation function and basis set utilized for predicting the spectra of the co-sensitizers are quite appropriate for the calculations. In conclusion, the results showed the potential of simple organic co-sensitizers in the development of efficient DSSCs. (C) 2017 Science Press. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It includes energy harvesting from mechanical, thermal, and light sources, and covers materials employed into yarns that can be woven into the textile and films that are deposited onto the surface of the textile. The textile places challenging constraints on the materials, for example, by limiting processing temperatures to typically less than 150 degrees C and presenting a rough, inconsistent surface profile. Example materials include a screen-printable low-temperature composite lead zirconate titanate polymer film and poly(vinylidene fluoride) polymer fibers, both of which have been shown to harvest mechanical energy from textiles. Thermoelectric solutions demonstrated thus far are limited and challenging to implement within a textile. Photovoltaic solutions include organic and dye-sensitized solar cells fabricated into functionalized yarns and as films spray-coated onto textiles. While numerous suitable example materials and textile devices have been demonstrated, work is still needed to develop these into practical energy-harvesting solutions.

Structural and Optical Properties of Nanocrystalline TiO2 with Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes and Its Photovoltaic Studies Using Ru(II) Sensitizers	ACS OMEGA			English	Article							SOLAR-ENERGY APPLICATIONS; HIGH-SURFACE-AREA; TIO2-MWCNTS NANOCOMPOSITES; PHOTOCATALYTIC ACTIVITY; VISIBLE-LIGHT; DYE; CELLS; NANOPARTICLES; NANOMATERIALS; DEGRADATION	In this study, the in situ sol-gel method has been deployed to prepare the titanium dioxide/multiwalled carbon nanotubes (TiO2/MWCNTs) nanocomposite (NCs) powders with varying content of MWCNTs (0.01-1.0 wt %), to construct the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). First, binder-free NCs were deposited on a transparent-conducting F:SnO2 (FTO) glass substrate by a doctor-blade technique and then anchored with Ru(II)-based dyes to either N719 or ruthenium phthalocyanine (RuPc). The structural and optical properties and interconnectivity of the materials within the composite are investigated thoroughly by various spectral techniques (XRD, XPS, Raman, FT-IR, and UV-vis), electron microscopy (HRTEM), and BET analysis. The experimental results suggest that the ratio of MWCNTs and TiO2 in NCs, morphology, and their interconnectivity influenced their structural, optical, and photovoltaic properties significantly. Finally, the photovoltaic performances of the assembled DSSCs with different content of MWCNTs to TiO2 films anchored with two different dyes were tested under one sun irradiation (100 mW/cm(2)). The measured current-voltage (IV) curve and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of TiO2/0.1 wt % MWCNTs (T@0.1 C) for N719 dye show three times more power conversion efficiency (eta = 6.21%) which is opposed to an efficiency (eta = 2.07%) of T@0.1 C for RuPc dye under the same operating conditions.

The molecular structures of SD-11 and SD-11 mono were confirmed using FTIR, H-1-NMR and mass spectrometry. The aim was to systematically study the effect of mono (SD-11 mono) versus bis-brominated-TPA moiety (SD-11) on molar absorptivity, ground and excited state oxidation potentials, light harvesting efficiency (LHE), incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE), short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), and total solar-to-electric conversion efficiency (eta) for DSCs. Optical results revealed that SD-11 and SD-11 mono have higher molar extinction coefficients, narrower HOMO - LUMO gaps compared to N719. Hence, it was found that SD-11 exhibited remarkably greater Jsc than SD-11 mono and interestingly showed comparable extinction coefficients. However, in optimized conditions, SD-11 showed a higher Jsc of 22.1 mA cm(-2), Voc of 0.68 V with (% eta) of 8.7 compared to Jsc of 14.4 mA cm(-2), Voc of 0.63 V and with (% eta) of 5.8 for SD-11 mono whereas N719 attained a Jsc of 15.9 mA cm(-2), Voc of 0.74 V with (% eta) of 7.6 under the same experimental device conditions. It was concluded that SD-11 outperformed SD-11 mono in photovoltaic performance when anchored on TiO2, owing to better light-harvesting ability. These results clearly demonstrated that the enhancement of the photovoltaic performance in SD-11 can be attributed to the presence of more number of -Br group.

Quasi-Solid-State Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells Containing a Charged Thermoplastic Elastomeric Gel Electrolyte and Hydrophilic/phobic Photosensitizers	SOLAR RRL			English	Article						block copolymers; dye-sensitized solar cells; gel electrolytes; photovoltaic; thermoplastic elastomers	PHASE-BEHAVIOR; BLOCK-COPOLYMERS; POLYMER ELECTROLYTES; TRIBLOCK COPOLYMER; EFFICIENCY; PERFORMANCE; MORPHOLOGY; BLENDS; HOMOPOLYMER; CHALLENGES	As the threat of global climate change due to combustion emissions becomes increasingly alarming, the search for clean and sustainable alternative energy is of paramount importance. With this objective in mind, harnessing solar energy is particularly attractive due to ongoing improvements in silicon-, perovskite-, and organic-based solar cells. Of these, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) constitute a promising technology due to their relatively low cost, moderate conversion efficiency, and robust mechanical properties. An important breakthrough in the development of DSSCs is the use of polymer gel electrolytes. In this work, we employ amphiphilic thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) in the form of sulfonated block ionomer (SBI) homologs for this purpose. Since the midblock of each charged copolymer is hydrophilic, the resultant microphase-separated nanostructures consist of continuous ionic channels that facilitate electron diffusion. A unique characteristic of the SBI archetype studied here is that the morphology can be solvent-templated. We exploit this feature by introducing either hydrophilic or hydrophobic photosensitizers into the DSSCs. When the SBI exhibits a primarily lamellar morphology, a hydrophilic dye yields the highest efficiency (7.0%), whereas the opposite is observed when the nanostructure consists of a solvent-templated nonpolar matrix. Photosensitizer tunability is augmented by the intrinsic mechanical and adhesive properties of a TPE.

Dye-sensitized films are also scientifically complex and interesting systems with a long history of research. In most applications, photoinduced heterogeneous electron transfer (HET) at the molecule/semiconductor interface is of critical importance, and while great progress has been made in understanding HET, many open questions remain. Of particular interest is the role of combined electronic and vibrational effects and coherence of the dye during HET. The ultrafast nature of the process, the rapid intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution, and vibrational cooling present complications in the study of vibronic coupling in HET. We present the application of a time domain vibrational spectroscopy-pump-degenerate four-wave mixing (pump-DFWM)-to dye-sensitized solid-state semiconductor films. Pump-DFWM can measure Raman-active vibrational modes that are triggered by excitation of the sample with an actinic pump pulse. Modifications to the instrument for solid-state samples and its application to an anatase TiO2 film sensitized by a Zn-porphyrin dye are discussed. We show an effective combination of experimental techniques to overcome typical challenges in measuring solid-state samples with laser spectroscopy and observe molecular vibrations following HET in a picosecond time window. The cation spectrum of the dye shows modes that can be assigned to the linker group and a mode that is localized on the Zn-phorphyrin chromophore and that is connected to photo excitation.

The neat SiO2 nanofibrous nonwoven mat (denoted as SiO2-NF) and the SiO2 mat functionalized with gold nanoparticles (denoted as Au@ SiO2-NF) were readily prepared by electro-spinning of spin dope containing precursors. Subsequently, a patterned layer of TiO2 nanoparticles was impregnated and transferred into the SiO2 or Au@SiO2-NF nonwoven mats. The freestanding composite mats of TiO2 nanoparticles and electrospun SiO2-NF or Au@SiO2-NF (denoted as TiO2-NP/SiO2-NF or TiO2-NP/Au@SiO2-NF, respectively) were demonstrated for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and photocatalytic dye degradation. By controlling the amount of TiO2, composite mats with only partially filled TiO2 nanoparticles on one side were used as photoanode and spacer in DSSCs; the device had an efficiency of 5.31%. Incorporation of Au nanoparticles in the photoanode (TiO2-NP/Au@SiO2-NF) improved the device performance. The thermally durable and freestanding TiO2-NP/SiO2-NF or TiO2-NP/Au@ SiO2-NF was also used as readily recyclable and regeneratable material for effective photodegradation of the methylene blue in aqueous solution.

Evidence that Delta S-double dagger Controls Interfacial Electron Transfer Dynamics from Anatase TiO2 to Molecular Acceptors	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							SENSITIZED SOLAR-CELLS; CHARGE-TRANSFER DYNAMICS; NANOCRYSTALLINE TIO2; RECOMBINATION DYNAMICS; ACTIVATED COMPLEX; HOLE TRANSFER; SEMICONDUCTOR; RUTHENIUM; ENERGY; SEPARATION	Recombination of electrons injected into TiO2 with molecular acceptors present at the interface represents an important loss mechanism in dye-sensitized water oxidation and electrical power generation. Herein, the kinetics for this interfacial electron transfer reaction to oxidized triphenylamine (TPA) acceptors was quantified over a 70 degrees temperature range for para-methyl-TPA (Me-TPA) dissolved in acetonitrile solution, 4-[N,N-di(p-tolyl)amino]benzylphosphonic acid (a-TPA) anchored to the TiO2, and a TPA covalently bound to a ruthenium sensitizer, [Ru(tpy-C6H4-PO3H2)(tpy-TPA)](2+) "RuTPA", where tpy is 2,2':6',2''-terpyridine. Activation energies extracted from an Arrhenius analysis were found to be 11 +/- 1 kJ mol(-1) for Me-TPA and 22 +/- 1 kJ mol(-1) for a-TPA, values that were insensitive to the identity of different sensitizers. Recombination to RuTPA(+) proceeded with E-a = 27 +/- 1 kJ mol(-1) that decreased to 19 +/- 1 kJ mol(-1) when recombination occurred to an oxidized para-methoxy TPA (MeO-TPA) dissolved in CH3CN. Eyring analysis revealed a smaller entropy of activation |Delta S-double dagger| when the a-TPA was anchored to the surface or covalently linked to the sensitizer, compared to that when Me-TPA was dissolved in CH3CN. In all cases, Eyring analysis provided large and negative Delta(double dagger) values that point toward unfavorable entropic factors as the key contributor to the barrier that underlies the slow recombination kinetics that are generally observed at dye-sensitized TiO2 interfaces.

J	Mukherjee, S; Liu, C; Jakubikova, E				Mukherjee, Sriparna; Liu, Chang; Jakubikova, Elena			Comparison of Interfacial Electron Transfer Efficiency in [Fe(ctpy)(2)](2+)-TiO2 and [Fe(cCNC)(2)](2+)-TiO2 Assemblies: Importance of Conformational Sampling	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							TRANSFER EXCITED-STATES; SENSITIZED SOLAR-CELLS; INITIO MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; CHARGE-TRANSFER; RUTHENIUM(II) COMPLEXES; QUANTUM DYNAMICS; POLYPYRIDINE COMPLEXES; EXCITATION-ENERGIES; FE(II) COMPLEXES; ORBITAL METHODS	Fe(II)-polypyridines have limited applications as chromophores in dye-sensitized solar cells due to the short lifetimes (similar to 100 fs) of their photoactive metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) states formed upon photoexcitation. Recently, a 100-fold increase in the MLCT lifetime was observed in a [Fe(CNC)(2)](2+) complex (CNC = 2,6-bis(3-methylimidazole-1-ylidine)pyridine) which has strong sigma-donating N-heterocyclic carbene ligand in comparison to the weaker field parent [Fe(tpy)(2)](2+) complex (tpy = 2,2':6',2 ''-terpyridine). This study utilizes density functional theory (DFT), time-dependent DFT, and quantum dynamics simulations to investigate the interfacial electron transfer (IET) in [Fe(cCNC)(2)](2+) (cCNC = 4'-carboxy-2,6-bis(3-methylimidazole-1-ylidine)pyridine) and [Fe(ctpy)(2)](2+) (ctpy = 4'-carboxy2,2':6',2 ''-terpyridine) sensitized TiO2. Our results suggest that the replacement of tpy by CNC ligand does not significantly speed up the IET kinetics in the [Fe(cCNC)(2)](2+) TiO2 assembly in comparison to the [Fe(ctpy)(2)](2+) TiO2 analogue. The high IET efficiency in the [Fe(cCNC)(2)](2+) TiO2 assemblies is therefore due to longer lifetime of [Fe(cCNC)(2)](2+) photoactive (MLCT)-M-3 states rather than faster electron injection kinetics. It was also found that the inclusion of conformational sampling in the computational model is important for proper description of the IET processes in these systems, as the models relying on the use of only fully optimized structures may yield misleading results. The simulations presented in this work also illustrate various pitfalls of utilizing properties such as electronic coupling, number of available acceptor states, and driving force, as well as calculations based on Fermi's golden rule framework, to reach conclusions on the IET efficiency in dye-semiconductor systems.

Highly transparent tetraaminophthalocyanine polymer films for DSSC cathodes	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							SENSITIZED SOLAR-CELLS; COUNTER ELECTRODE MATERIALS; INTERFACIAL CHARGE-TRANSFER; THIN-FILMS; ELECTROCHEMICAL REACTIONS; TRANSFER KINETICS; SOLVENT DYNAMICS; HIGH-EFFICIENCY; LOW-COST; COBALT	An inexpensive, transparent, catalytic, and highly stable material is the holy grail for a dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) cathode. Despite a near exponential increase in research effort on DSSC cathodes, materials approaching this ideal have yet to be found. Transparent cathodes allow for front and back illumination of the solar cell, enable alternative anode materials and cell designs, and are important both for fundamental research and commercialization of DSSCs. In this work, thin polymeric films of nickel tetraminophthalocyanine (NiTAPc) were tested as a catalytic cathode material in Co(Bipy)-mediated DSSCs. The thin films are highly transparent with a transmittance at 550 nm (T550) of over 95% while maintaining an R-ct value below 1.3 Omega cm(2). The NiTAPc films are inexpensive, fast and easy to generate, and stable to 2000 cyclic voltammetry cycles. Long-term film stability was not realized, and a rise in the R-ct over time (days) occurred. However, poly-NiTAPc still represents one of the most transparent and catalytic materials reported to date. While historically phthalocyanines (Pc) have been studied as a dye/sensitizer, this first report of phthalocyanine use as a cathode material demonstrates they have utility on both sides of the DSSC.

Surface Photovoltage Spectroscopy Resolves Interfacial Charge Separation Efficiencies in ZnO Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							ZINC-OXIDE; ELECTRON INJECTION; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; ORGANIC-DYES; FILMS; TIO2; RECOMBINATION; COMPLEX; IODIDE; NANOSTRUCTURES	Any optimization of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) must consider the energetics and charge transfer kinetics of the dye, substrate, and redox couple. Here, we use surface photovoltage spectroscopy to probe the energetics and photochemical charge transfer efficiency in fluorenyl-thiophene dye (OD-8)-sensitized ZnO films. Discrete photochemical charge transfer events at the dye-ZnO interface and at the dye- I-/I-3(-) or [Co(2,2'-bipyridyl)(3)](3+/2+) interfaces can be observed as negative photovoltage under dye excitation at 1.7 eV (460 nm). Without a redox couple, charge separation at the ZnO/dye interface is only 4% effective, likely due to the short electron hole separation distance. In the presence of the redox couples, charge separation approaches 26-54% of the theoretical limit, emphasizing the importance of the dye regeneration reaction via the redox couple. On the basis of the open circuit voltage, charge separation in fully assembled DSSCs is 100% efficient with iodide, but only 61% efficient with the cobalt redox couple. This suggests that device improvements are possible by optimizing the dye regeneration reaction with the cobalt redox couple.

In recent years, photoactive species have been deposited on high surface area supports and investigated for a variety of applications that include Dye Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSC), photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical splitting of water, and photocatalytic degradation of organics. Basic materials like MgO are attractive as supports for the above mentioned applications, since they can be synthesized conveniently with relatively large surface areas and porosities. The wide band gap (>7 eV) and hence the insulating nature of MgO also lends itself to interesting uses in several applications involving solar energy conversion. The presence of low amounts of MgO has been found to be beneficial for DSSC, photo-electrochemical splitting of water, and photocatalytic degradation of dye molecules and will be discussed in-depth in this review.

In this study, an oligo-aromatic group, the 4,5-dihexy1-4,5-dihydrothieno[2 '',3 '':4',5']pyrrolo[2',3':4,5] thieno[3,2-b]indole (DPTI) is first introduced as the pi-bridge in organic dyes (M81, M83 and M84) for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). For comparison, a reference dye M82 without the DPTI unit has also been prepared. We have carefully examined their optical and electrochemical properties and device performance. It is found that introduction of the DPTI unit enhanced the light harvesting of dyes and reduced the charge recombination in devices. Among these DPTI dyes, the sensitizer M84 containing a twisted structure achieves a power conversion efficiency of 7.59% measured under the 100 mW cm(-2), simulated AM1.5 sunlight.

Direct photoactivation of a nickel-based, water-reduction photocathode by a highly conjugated supramolecular chromophore	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							SENSITIZED SOLAR-CELLS; ARTIFICIAL PHOTOSYNTHESIS; PHOTOELECTROCHEMICAL CELLS; ENERGY CONVERSION; ELECTRON-TRANSFER; HYDROGEN; FUELS; PORPHYRINS; DEPENDENCE; EVOLUTION	In dye-sensitized photoelectrosynthesis cells, multi-step photoinduced electron transfer takes place to generate redox-separated (RS) states that activate catalysts for water splitting or carbon dioxide reduction. From photoexcitation of the chromophores to formation of the RS states, the solar energy initially stored at the chromophore excited states is reduced stepwise in a sequence of photoinduced electron transfer steps. We report here a water-reduction photocathode based on a supramolecular chromophore, an ethyne-bridged (porphyrinato)zinc(II) and bis(terpyridyl)ruthenium(II) complex, which is surface-bound to a mesoporous nickel oxide electrode, with an over-layer of nickel sulfide derivative as a water reduction catalyst. Visible light excitation of the chromophore generates a long-lived RS state that forms directly at its excited state with the electron delocalized at the terpyridyl ligands for transferring to the nickel sulfide catalyst, and the hole at the zinc porphyrin moiety for injecting into the nickel oxide electrode. The resulting photocathode shows enhanced photoelectrocatalytic performances relative to the previously reported NiO-based photocathodes. A key element lies in the efficient, direct activation of the catalyst by the long-lived, RS excited state that minimizes the energy loss along the photoinduced electron transfer steps towards water reduction.

The levels of oxygen vacancies (OVs) in WO3 were finely formed and tuned by doping with different weight percentages (3, 5, and 9 wt%) of urea and annealing in a N-2 environment at 470 degrees C. The urea doped WO3 significantly improved the electrocatalytic behaviour in the iodide-triiodide electrolyte. The effects of OVs on the catalytic performance of WO3 CEs were fully studied and understood. This improvement was attributed to the introduction of OVs into WO3, which acted as surface shallow states to facilitate electron transfer from the WO3 counter electrode to the electrolyte. At a high temperature of 470 degrees C, urea decomposes into the reactive H-2 gas that can remove oxygen atoms from the WO3 surface and create OVs. 5 wt% urea was found to be the optimal urea concentration that led to the highest catalytic performance as evidenced by the cyclic voltammetry measurements. The 5 wt% urea doped WO3 CE-based device achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of similar to 10.5%, which was improved from the reference Pt CE-based device at similar to 9.3% and non-active WO3 CE based cell at 3.32%. This has led to the optimal number of OVs that facilitate the charge transfer at the CE/electrolyte interface.

In this research, graphene quantum dots were prepared from corn powder and were applied in DSSCs as down conversion materials. These prepared graphene quantum dots convert UV light to 450 and 520 nm light which favorable for DSSCs. Modified solar cell based on graphene quantum dots shows 21% enhancement in Jsc compare to the reference cell. EIS, IMPS and IMVS have used to approve that this enhancement is because of down conversion effect of graphene quantum dots. The results of our study offer a novel down conversion material which have many advantages compare to the previous reports. These results could be used in other photovoltaic systems.

Their absorption spectrum shows a wide tunability that ranges from visible to NIR. Sensitization in the NIR region is crucial for exploiting a particularly intense portion of the solar spectrum. In this work three squaraines will be presented and tested as sensitizers in NiO-based p-type DSSC O4_C2, O4_C4 and O4_C12). The structures of the dyes differ for the length of the alkyl side chain (C2, C4 and C12). Alkyl side chains improve the solubility of the dye, influence the extent of dye loading on the electrode and affect the overall efficiency of devices. The generally low stability of squaraines represents a critical issue in view of their employment as sensitizers of p-DSSC. Such a problem becomes even more evident when this class of molecules is bound onto an acidic surface like the one of the photocathode here employed: non-stoichiometric nickel oxide (NiOx). NiOx possesses a quite acidic character because of the high surface concentration of Ni(III) sites. To buffer the surface acidity of NiOx due to the presence of high-valence states of nickel, we considered the electrode pretreatment with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) prior to sensitization. This assures a major stability of the solar cell. At the same time the chemisorbed hydroxyl moieties act as passivating agents of the Ni(III) sites thus diminishing the surface concentration of sites for dye anchoring.

Dye-sensitized electron transfer from TiO2 to oxidized triphenylamines that follows first-order kinetics	CHEMICAL SCIENCE			English	Article							NANOCRYSTALLINE SOLAR-CELLS; COMPLEX REDOX SHUTTLES; CHARGE RECOMBINATION; PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT; DISTANCE DEPENDENCE; TRANSPORT; MEDIATORS; SEMICONDUCTOR; INTERFACES; DYNAMICS	Two sensitizers, [Ru(bpy)(2)(dcb)](2+) (RuC) and [Ru(bpy)(2)(dpb)](2+) (RuP), where bpy is 2,2'-bipyridine, dcb is 4,4'-dicarboxylic acid-2,2'-bipyridine and dpb is 4,4'-diphosphonic acid-2,2'-bipyridine, were anchored to mesoporous TiO2 thin films and utilized to sensitize the reaction of TiO2 electrons with oxidized triphenylamines, TiO2(e(-)) + TPA(+) -> TiO2 + TPA, to visible light in CH3CN electrolytes. A family of four symmetrically substituted triphenylamines (TPAs) with formal E-o(TPA(+/0)) reduction potentials that spanned a 0.5 eV range was investigated. Surprisingly, the reaction followed first-order kinetics for two TPAs that provided the largest thermodynamic driving force. Such first-order reactivity indicates a strong Coulombic interaction between TPA(+) and TiO2 that enables the injected electron to tunnel back in one concerted step. The kinetics for the other TPA derivatives were non-exponential and were modelled with the Kohlrausch-William-Watts (KWW) function. A Perrin-like reaction sphere model is proposed to rationalize the kinetic data. The activation energies were the same for all of the TPAs, within experimental error. The average rate constants were found to increase with the thermodynamic driving force, consistent with electron transfer in the Marcus normal region.

However, no demonstrations of photovoltaic action from ion-exchange materials existed. We recently reported a synthetic light-driven proton pump derived from an ion-exchange membrane. Absorption of light by covalently bound photoacid molecules resulted in photovoltaic action. This design lacked a second permselective membrane contact, which limited its performance. Here, we report a similar to 60-fold increase in the photovoltage through use of a bipolar membrane structure consisting of a cation-exchange membrane affixed to an anion-exchange membrane. The junction between the layers was characterized in detail using electrochemistry, scanning electron microscopy, spectroscopy, and thermal gravimetric analysis. Our results represent considerable progress toward a device that directly converts sunlight into ionic electricity, which has implications for direct solar desalination of salt water.

Interfacial Deposition of Ru(II) Bipyridine-Dicarboxylate Complexes by Ligand Substitution for Applications in Water Oxidation Catalysis	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							SENSITIZED SOLAR-CELLS; ATOMIC LAYER DEPOSITION; METAL-OXIDE SURFACES; PHOTOELECTROCHEMICAL CELLS; TIO2 NANOCRYSTALS; HIGHLY EFFICIENT; DYE; CHROMOPHORE; PHOTOANODES; PERFORMANCE	Water oxidation is a critical step in artificial photosynthesis and provides the protons and electrons used in reduction reactions to make solar fuels. Significant advances have been made in the area of molecular water oxidation catalysts with a notable breakthrough in the development of Ru(II) complexes that use a planar "bda" ligand (bda is 2,2'-bipyridine-6,6'-dicarboxylate). These Ru(II)(bda) complexes show lower overpotentials for driving water oxidation making them ideal for light-driven applications with a suitable chromophore. Nevertheless, synthesis of heterogeneous Ru(II)(bda) complexes remains challenging. We discuss here a new "bottom-up" synthetic method for immobilizing these catalysts at the surface of a photoanode for use in a dye-sensitized photoelectrosynthesis cell (DSPEC). The procedure provides a basis for rapidly screening the role of ligand variations at the catalyst in order to understand the impact on device performance. The best results of a water-oxidation DSPEC photoanode based on this procedure reached 1.4 mA/cm(2) at pH 7 in 0.1 M [PO4H2](-)/[PO4H](2-)solution with minimal loss in catalytic behavior over 30 min, and produced an incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of 24.8% at 440 nm.

A transfer matrix model is used to separate electronic losses from optical losses in the form of parasitic absorption. It is reported that MAPbI(3-x)Cl(x) is the superior absorber due to increased crystallinity, but that the benefit from using the chloride-assisted formulation is negated when the absorber is deposited on a mesoporous substrate. It is also reported that some beneficial electronic and optical effects are associated with the mesoporous TiO2: decreased parasitic absorption at short wavelengths and possible enhancement of charge transfer; the overall use of the mesoporous scaffold typically seen in dye-sensitized solar cells is not appropriate for perovskite-sensitized solar cells, where it disrupts the formation of large perovskite grains. The analysis also provides important insight into the application of transfer matrix modeling in pseudoplanar systems such as the ubiquitous mesoporous solar cell architecture.

J	Xu, SJ; Liu, C; Wiezorek, J				Xu, Shunjian; Liu, Can; Wiezorek, Jorg			20 renewable biowastes derived carbon materials as green counter electrodes for dye-sensitized solar cells	MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article						Biowaste; Carbon materials; Pyrolysis; Counter electrode; Dye-sensitized solar cells	ACTIVATED CARBON; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; LOW-COST; POROUS CARBON; PORE STRUCTURE; EFFICIENCY; SUPERCAPACITOR; FABRICATION; PYROLYSIS; COMPOSITE	Twenty types of biowastes derived carbon materials (BCM) synthesized by a facile one-step pyrolysis were developed as counter electrodes for the configuration of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The biowastes selected for the BCM preparation were divided into three groups: (i) eleven woods, including weeping willow, phoenix, camphor, Chinese fir, maple, peach, poplar, cypress, tea-oil camellia, orange, and chinaberry; (ii) seven leaves, including pine needles, camphor, palm, maple, poplar, Chinese fir, and red after-wood; and (iii) two papers, namely filter paper and facial tissue. Each of the BCM based DSSCs shows a higher efficiency than the graphite based counterparts. The efficiencies of the DSSCs employing the BCM prepared from woods and leaves vary in a range 1.23% -1.91% and 1.07%-1.85%, respectively, while that of the devices using the graphite is 0.77%. The peak efficiency in both groups of the wood and leaf based cells is achieved by employing the phoenix wood and the palm leaf as the raw materials, respectively. Compared with the porous BCM obtained from the woods and leaves, the fibrous BCM fabricated from the papers show better efficiencies of around 4.70% for use in the DSSCs. The high efficiency is mainly attributed to the superior catalytic activity and faster electron transportation for triiodide (13) reduction induced by the unique morphological and structural characteristics of the paper derived BCM, such as hierarchical fibrous carbon skeletons at nanometer and micron scales, abundant exposed microcrystal edges and defects, rough surface at nanoscale with rich burrs and convex microstructures, and oxygen-containing surface functional groups. Furthermore, the efficiency of the DSSCs employing the paper derived BCM is equal to about 88% of that of the devices using the mesoporous carbon synthesized from the phenolic resin mixtures based on polymerization-induced phase separation.

The photocatalytic hydrogen production was investigated by varying amount of TiO2 loading (0, 0.1, 0.8 and 1.2 wt%) on the surface of BiVO4 from water splitting in a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell and dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) system. The crystallographic, morphological and chemical composition properties of the prepared TiO2/BiVO4 thin film was investigated by using different characterization techniques. The 0.8 wt% TiO2/BiVO4 was identified as the most efficient photocatalyst by producing maximum accumulative hydrogen of 692 mu mol within 120 min. The maximum hydrogen production obtained is attributed to a compact particle network between BiVO4 and TiO2 particles which provide an intimate contact with the electron collecting FTO substrate.

Structural benefits of long alkyl chains and electron donor group on photo conversion efficiency (PCE) of dye sensitized solar cells is discussed. A previously synthesised dye, denoted CL-1, which contained long alkyl chains and exhibited an efficiency of 6.90%, was compared with CL-SiMe, which contained shorter alkyl chains and showed and efficiency of 3.41%. A large drop in J(sc) and V-oc was found to be the reason for the appreciable decline in efficiency for CL-SiMe vis-a-vis CL-1. Electron donor group studies were performed using CL-1D and CL-OMe. CL-1D, which contained bulky aniline electron donor groups, showed an efficiency of 4.20%, whilst CL-OMe, featuring smaller methoxy donor groups had an efficiency of 5.50%. Theoretical UV-Vis absorption spectra were obtained for the CL-1D dye by time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT); the experimental and calculated values of the energy for maximum absorbance were in good agreement with experimental data.

However, the colloidal synthesis of 2D quaternary chalcogenide nanomaterials remains a great challenge owing to the lack of intrinsic driving force for its anisotropic growth. 2D wurtzite Cu2ZnSnS4 nanosheets (CZTS-NS) with high-energy (002) facets have been obtained for the first time via a simple one-pot thermal decomposition method. The CZTS-NS exhibits superior photoelectrochemical activity as compared to zero-dimensional CZTS nanospheres and comparable performance to Pt counter electrode for dye sensitized solar cells. The improved catalytic activity can be attributed to additional reactive catalytic sites and higher catalytic reactivity in high-energy (002) facets of 2D CZTS-NS. This is in accordance with the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which indicates that the (002) facets of wurtzite CZTS-NS possess higher surface energy and exhibits remarkable reducibility for I-3(-) ions. The developed synthetic method and findings will be helpful for the design and synthesis of 2D semiconducting nanomaterials, especially eco-friendly copper chalcogenide nanocrystals for energy harvesting and photoelectric applications.

However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of devices has been limited largely by the difficulty of producing electricity using photons from the near-infrared (NIR) spectral region. Metal-free organic sensitizers frequently employ strong electron-donating or -withdrawing moieties to tune the optical band gap to allow the absorption of lower energy wavelengths in charge-transfer systems, whereas porphyrins and phthalocyanines use substituents to shift the Soret and Q bands toward lower energy absorption. Very few devices employing precious metal-free dyes have achieved panchromatic and NIR photon conversion for electricity generation at wavelengths >750nm despite a tremendous number of sensitizers published over the last 25years.

Photocathode Chromophore-Catalyst Assembly via Layer-By-Layer Deposition of a Low Band-Gap Isoindigo Conjugated Polyelectrolyte	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						conjugated polyelectrolyte; Stille polymerization; layer-by-layer polyelectrolyte assembly; solar fuels; hydrogen evolution; photocathode	DYE; WATER; HYDROGEN; NANOPARTICLES; INTERLAYERS; CELLS	Low band-gap conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) can serve as efficient chromophores for use on photoelectrodes for dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells. Herein is reported a novel CPE based on poly(isoindigo-co-thiophene) with pendant sodium butylsulfonate groups (PiIT) and its use in construction of layer-by-layer (LbL) chromophore-catalyst assemblies with a Pt-based H+ reduction catalyst (PAA-Pt) for water reduction. A novel Stifle polymerization/postpolymerization ion-exchange strategy was used to convert an organic-soluble CPE to the water-soluble poly(isoindigo-co-thiophene). The anionic PiIT polyelectrolyte- and polyacrylate-stabilized Pt-nanoparticles (PAA-Pt) were codeposited with cationic poly(diallyldimethylammonium) chloride (PDDA) onto inverse opal (IO), nanostructured indium tin oxide film (nITO) (IO nITO) atop fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO), by using LbL self-assembly. To evaluate the performance of novel conjugated PiIT//PAA-Pt chromphore-catalyst assemblies, interassembly hole transfer was investigated by photocurrent density measurements on FTO//IO nITO electrodes. Enhanced cathodic photocurrent is observed for the polychromophore-catalyst assemblies, compared to electrodes modified with only PiIT, pointing toward photoinduced hole transfer from the excited PiIT to the IO nITO. Prolonged photoelectrolysis experiments reveal H-2 production with a Faradaic yield of approximately 45%. This work provides new routes to carry out visible-light-driven water reduction using photocathode assemblies based on low band-gap CPEs.	[Leem, Gyu; Bantang, Jose P.

J	Chen, HY; Ardo, S				Chen, Hsiang-Yun; Ardo, Shane			Direct observation of sequential oxidations of a titania-bound molecular proxy catalyst generated through illumination of molecular sensitizers	NATURE CHEMISTRY			English	Article							ACCUMULATIVE CHARGE SEPARATION; STATE ELECTRON-TRANSFER; WATER-OXIDATION; VISIBLE-LIGHT; PHOTOINDUCED ABSORPTION; SOLAR-CELLS; SINGLE-SITE; HYDROGEN; COMPLEXES; FUNCTIONALIZATION	Natural photosynthesis uses the energy in sunlight to oxidize or reduce reaction centres multiple times, therefore preparing each reaction centre for a multiple-electron-transfer reaction that will ultimately generate stable reaction products. This process relies on multiple chromophores per reaction centre to quickly generate the active state of the reaction centre and to outcompete deleterious charge recombination. Using a similar design principle, we report spectroscopic evidence for the generation of a twice-oxidized TiO2-bound molecular proxy catalyst after low-intensity visible-light excitation of co-anchored molecular Ru(II)-polypyridyl dyes. Electron transfer from an excited dye to TiO2 generated a Ru(III) state that subsequently and repeatedly reacted with neighbouring Ru(II) dyes via self-exchange electron transfer to ultimately oxidize a distant co-anchored proxy catalyst before charge recombination. The largest yield for twice-oxidized proxy catalysts occurred when they were present at low coverage, suggesting that large dye/electrocatalyst ratios are also desired in dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells.

Functionalized carboxylate deposition of triphenylamine-based organic dyes for efficient dye-sensitized solar cells	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							PHOTOVOLTAIC PROPERTIES; TIO2 FILMS; RECOMBINATION; ZNO	The standard dip-coating dye-loading technique for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) remains essentially unchanged since modern DSSCs were introduced in 1991. This technique constitutes up to 80% of the DSSC fabrication time. Dip-coating of DSSC dyes not only costs time, but also generates a large amount of dye waste, necessitates use of organic solvents, requires sensitization under dark conditions, and often results in inefficient sensitization. Functionalized Carboxylate Deposition (FCD) was introduced as an alternative dye deposition technique, requiring only 2% of the fabrication time, eliminating the need for solvents, and significantly reducing dye waste. In this study, FCD was used to deposit two relatively large triphenylamine-based organic dyes (L1 and L2). These dyes were sublimated and deposited in <20 minutes via a customized FCD instrument using a vacuum of approximate to 0.1 mTorr and temperatures 280 degrees C. FCD-based DSSCs showed better efficiency (i.e., 5.03% and 5.46% for L1 and L2 dyes, respectively) compared to dip-coating (i.e., 4.36% and 5.35% for L1 and L2, respectively) in a fraction of the deposition time. With multiple advantages over dip-coating, FCD was shown to be a viable alternative for future ultra-low cost DSSC production.

Enhancing the Photovoltaic Performance of Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells with Rare-Earth Metal Oxide Nanoparticles	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							ELECTRON-TRANSPORT; EFFICIENCY; PHOTOANODES; TITANIA; LAYER; ND	Doping titania with rare-earth metals improves the photoconversion efficiency (PCE) of dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). In most reported cases, the overall cell quality is not optimal, making it unclear what role the rare earth oxide metal plays in the improvement, if any. Here we incorporate < 100 nm diameter nanoparticles of neodymium and erbium oxide into titania films and test their performance in high quality DSSCs. The doping level for optimized cells is 2.0% and 1.0% for neodymium oxide and erbium oxide by weight, respectively. This results in a 5 to 10% increase in PCE for the rare earth oxide doped DSSCs relative to undoped DSSCs, with erbium oxide being the best. The rare-earth metal-doped films exhibit a 20-25% larger dye loading and the loading was maximum at the same doping levels where the PCE was maximum, showing this is a big contributor to the improvement. The surface area is larger with rare-earth doped titania as determined by atomic force microscopy and BET analysis, explaining the higher dye loading. The cell impedance is lower with rare-earth doped samples, showing that the rare-earth metal oxide also facilitates electron transport through the mesoporous titania, improving the collection efficiency of the photoexcited electrons.

TiO2 nanotubes in ST-TNTAs vertically grew on the FTO substrate in single crystallized rutile phase, while SrTiO3 grains in cubic perovskite phase dispersed evenly on the surface of TiO2. The sandwich shaped all-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were assembled with TiO2 nanorods, nanotubes and ST-TNTAs as the photoanode, respectively. Once SrTiO3 deposited, the position of Fermi level of the composited semiconductor raised, resulting in the increase of open circuit voltage (Von). Meanwhile, both short-circuit current density (J(SC)) and photoelectrical conversion efficiency (n) increased first and then decreased with the amount of SrTiO3. In comparison to TiO2 nanorods and nanotubes, ST-TNTAs demonstrated the highest photoelectrical conversion efficiency (5.42%) under the irradiation of solar simulator and external quantum efficiency (EQE) at visible region, and also the lowest electron transfer resistance, which further proved that SrTiO3 acted as a good medium for electron transfer between TiO2 and photosensitizer. As a result, both the increased surface area of the nanotube relative to the nanorod and the matched bandgap structure in the composited structure of TiO2 and SrTiO3 improve the performance of the DSSCs.

Efficient Calculation of Absorption Spectra in Solution: Approaches for Selecting Representative Solvent Configurations and for Reducing the Number of Explicit Solvent Molecules	ACTA PHYSICO-CHIMICA SINICA			English	Article						Monte Carlo simulation; Chromophore; Spectra; Solution	MONTE-CARLO SIMULATIONS; TRANSFERABLE POTENTIALS; SOLAR-CELLS; SOLVATOCHROMIC SHIFTS; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; QUANTUM-MECHANICS; PHASE-EQUILIBRIA; AQUEOUS-SOLUTION; TRANSITION; AGGREGATION	Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are one of the most promising renewable energy technologies. Charge transfer and charge transport are pivotal processes in DSSCs, which govern solar energy capture and conversion. These processes can be probed using modern electronic structure methods. Because of the heterogeneity and complexity of the local environment of a chromophore in DSSCs (such as solvatochromism and chromophore aggregation), a part of the solvation environment should be treated explicitly during the calculation. However, because of the high computational cost and unfavorable scaling with the number of electrons of high-level quantum mechanical methods, approaches to explicitly treat the local environment need careful consideration. Two problems must be tackled to reduce computational cost. First, the number of configurations representing the solvent distribution should be limited as much as possible. Second, the size of the explicit region should be kept relatively small. The purpose of this study is to develop efficient computational approaches to select representative configurations and to limit the explicit solvent region to reduce the computational cost for later (higher-level) quantum mechanical calculations. For this purpose, an ensemble of solvent configurations around a 1-methyl-8-oxyquinolinium betaine (QB) dye molecule was generated using Monte Carlo simulations and molecular mechanics force fields. Then, a fitness function was developed using data from inexpensive electronic structure calculations to reduce the number of configurations. Specific solvent molecules were also selected for explicit treatment based on a distance criterion, and those not selected were treated as background charges. The configurations and solvent molecules selected proved to be good representatives of the entire ensemble; thus, expensive electronic structure calculations need to be performed only on this subset of the system, which significantly reduces the computational cost.

Cryoconcentration of flavonoid extract for enhanced biophotovoltaics and pH sensitive thin films	BIOTECHNOLOGY PROGRESS			English	Article						anthocyanin; cryoconcentration; dye sensitized solar cell; pH sensitive thin film	PROGRESSIVE FREEZE-CONCENTRATION; INKJET PRINTED GRAPHENE; RED CABBAGE EXTRACT; ANTHOCYANIN PIGMENTS; OPTIMIZATION; FLUORESCENCE; JUICES; COLOR; YIELD; SIZE	Flavonoids are important value added products for dye sensitized solar cells biosensors, functional foods, medicinal supplements, nanomaterial synthesis, and other applications. Brassica oleracea contains high levels of anthocyanins in leaf sap vacuoles, and there are many viable extraction techniques that vary in terms of simplicity, environmental impact, cost, and extract photochemical/electrochemical properties. The efficiency of value added biotechnologies from flavonoid is a function of anthocyanin activity/concentration and molecule stability (i.e., ability to retain molecular resonance under a wide range of conditions). In this paper, we show that block cryoconcentration and partial thawing of anthocyanin from B. oleracea is a green, facile, and highly efficient technique that does not require any special equipment or protocols for producing enhanced value added products. Cryoconcentration increased anthocyanin activity and total phenol content approximately 10 times compared with common extraction techniques. Cryoconcentrated extract had enhanced electrochemical properties (higher oxidation potential), improved chroma, and higher UV absorbance than extract produced with other methods for a pH range of 2-12, with minimal effect on the diffusion coefficient of the extract. As a proof of concept for energy harvesting and sensor applications, dye sensitized solar cells and pH-sensitive thin films were prepared and tested. These devices were comparable with other recently published biotechnologies in terms of efficacy, but did not require expensive/environmentally detrimental extraction or concentration methods. This low cost, biorenewable, and simple method can be used for development of a variety of value added products. (c) 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

In this Review, low cost and scalable processing techniques to synthesize phase-pure pyrite thin films and nanocubes are described, and the application of this material in various energy-harvesting devices such as dye-sensitized solar cells, photodiodes, and heterojunction solar cells is discussed. A detailed analysis of the electron transport in single-crystal iron pyrite is presented to shed light on its bulk- and surface-conduction properties, which could be useful in designing better pyrite solar cells and could be exploited for novel device architectures. Finally, future prospects and directions are discussed.

ALD nicely achieved a uniform coating of the individual ZnO particles with a thin skin of TiO2 of uniform thickness. The overall mesoporous structure was unchanged, so that a high surface area for dye adsorption and pores for penetration of the electrolyte solution were preserved. DSSCs employing the core-shell electrode sensitized with D149 indoline dye achieved a higher open circuit voltage (V (OC)) than that with ZnO, but accompanied with a decrease of short circuit photocurrent density (J (SC)) due to decreased efficiency of electron injection. Increase of the recombination resistance to extend the electron lifetime by the TiO2 shell has been confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). X-ray diffraction analysis has revealed that the ALD TiO2 is amorphous and can only be converted to crystalline anatase TiO2 by annealing at 450 A degrees C. The crystallization recovered current but lost the advantage of the voltage increase. EIS has indicated a high trap density introduced by the amorphous ALD TiO2, which could be reduced by crystallization, but accompanied with an increased rate of recombination.

Effect of Few-Layered Graphene-Based CdO Nanocomposite-Enhanced Power Conversion Efficiency of Dye-Sensitized Solar Cell	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS			English	Article						Few-layered graphene; FLG/CdO nanocomposite; characterization; power conversion efficiency; dye-sensitized solar cell	CHARGE RECOMBINATION; STORAGE; OXIDE; PERFORMANCE; PHOTOANODE; COMPOSITE; TRANSPORT; FILMS; MORPHOLOGY; REDUCTION	A few-layered graphene (FLG)/cadmium oxide (CdO) nanocomposite was sucessfully prepared through ultrasonic-assisted synthesis. The morphology of FLG (1.0 wt.%, 2.0 wt.%, and 3.0 wt.%)/CdO nanocomposites were characterized using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy techniques. The optical properties were studied with the help of UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy, while the crystalline phases were analyzed using x-ray diffraction. The doctor blade method was used to deposit FLG/CdO nanocomposites on fluorine-doped tin oxide conductive glass substrates. The effect of FLG weight percentage (1.0 wt.%, 2.0 wt.%, and 3.0 wt.%) was studied on the power conversion efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cell applications. The photovoltaic characteristics, current density-voltage curves were measured with ruthenium (II)-based dye under air mass condition 1.5G, 100 m W m(-2) of a solar simulator. The results showed that higher power conversion efficiency of 3.54% was achieved at the appropriate weight percentage of FLG (1.0 wt.%)/CdO nanocomposite, compared to the CdO and other nanocomposite working electrodes FLG (2.0 wt.%, and 3.0 wt.%)/CdO.

J	Shim, JH; Bae, IT; Cho, J				Shim, Jong Hyun; Bae, In-Tae; Cho, Junghyun			Microstructure development of hydrothermally grown TiO2 thin films with vertically aligned nanorods	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CERAMIC SOCIETY			English	Article						hydrothermal; nanorods; nanowires; thin films; titanium dioxide	PHOTOCATALYTIC ACTIVITY; NANOPARTICLES; NANOCRYSTALS	TiO2 (rutile) thin films were deposited via a hydrothermal process by adjusting the amount of ethanol, deposition time, and temperature. Especially, various amounts of ethanol generated different degrees of supersaturation in precursor solution. It allowed us to systematically change the width, lengths, and crystallinity of a vertically aligned 1-D nanorod structure of TiO2 films. The oriented attachment, confirmed by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, was shown to be responsible for their lateral growth of TiO2 nanorods bundled by numerous well-oriented nanowires and their vertical growth. TiO2 nanorod thin films were also characterized via X-ray diffraction and UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer to find a correlation between the process conditions and nanostructural evolution. Dye sensitized solar cells were assembled to relate the nanostructures of TiO2 films with the effectiveness of its role as a photoelectrode.
