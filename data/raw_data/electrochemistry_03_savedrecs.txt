In spite of the ubiquity of RAP-modified electrodes, a critical knowledge gap exists in the understanding of the electrochemistry of soluble RAPs and their relation to polyelectrolyte dynamics. Here, we explore for the first time the intersection between polyelectrolyte behavior and the electrochemical response that highly soluble and highly substituted RAPs with viologen, ferrocene, and nitrostyrene moieties elicit at electrodes. This comprehensive study of RAP electrolytes over several orders of magnitude in concentration and ionic strength reveals distinct signatures consistent with surface confined, colloidal, and bulk-like electrochemical behavior. These differences emerge across polyelectrolyte packing regimes and are strongly modulated by changes in RAP coil size and electrostatic interactions with the electrode. We found that, unlike monomer motifs, simple changes in the ionic strength caused variations over 1 order of magnitude in the current measured at the electrode. In addition, the thermodynamics of adsorbed RAP films were also affected, giving rise to standard reduction potential shifts leading to redox kinetic effects as a result of the mediating nature of the RAP film in equilibrium with the solution. Full electrochemical characterization via transient and steadystate techniques, including the use of ultramicroelectrodes and the rotating disk electrode, were correlated to dynamic light scattering, ellipsometry, and viscometric analysis. These methods helped elucidate the relationship between electrochemical behavior and RAP coil size, film thickness, and polyelectrolyte packing regime. This study underscores the role of electrostatics in modulating the reactivity of redox polyelectrolytes.

Electrochemistry, spectroelectrochemistry, and photoelectrochemistry could be viable tools both for analyzing the optoelectronic features of these materials and for assembling them into hybrid architectures (e.g., solar cells). At the same time, the instability of these materials limits the pool of solvents and electrolytes that can be employed in such experiments. The focus of our study is to establish a stability window for electrochemical tests for all-inorganic CsPbBr3 and hybrid organic-inorganic MAPbI(3) perovskites. In addition, we aimed to understand the reduction and oxidation events that occur and to assess the damage done during these processes at extreme electrochemical conditions. In this vein, we demonstrated the chemical, structural, and morphological changes of the films in both reductive and oxidative environments. Taking all these results together as a whole, we propose a set of boundary conditions and protocols for how electrochemical experiments with lead halide perovskites should be carried out and interpreted. The presented results will contribute to the understanding of the electrochemical response of these materials and lead to a standardization of results in the literature so that comparisons can more easily be made.

These represent the first examples of the Ni-II(NHC2)L-2 class of compounds, where L is a two-electron-donor ligand. The introduction of a double propyl bridged bis-NHC ligand ((CC)-C-Prop2) imparts reversibility to the electrochemistry of these complexes. The electrochemical response includes two reductions, the first believed to be bipy ligand based, bipy(0/-), and the second metal based. The unusual ligand arrangements in these complexes result in electronic structures in which both the HOMOs and LUMOs are ligand-based, as determined by DFT analysis of all four compounds.

Visualizing the Effect of Partial Oxide Formation on Single Silver Nanoparticle Electrodissolution	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							INDIVIDUAL NANOPARTICLES; METAL NANOPARTICLES; AG NANOPARTICLES; MICROSCOPY; COLLISION; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; OXIDATION; SERS; KINETICS; SURFACE	The impact of heterogeneous surface oxide formation on the electrochemical performance of single silver nanoparticles is explored using in situ superlocalization optical microscopy. Silver nanoparticles are well-known to form a natural oxide layer on their surface, but the effect of this oxide layer on electrochemical reactions is not well understood. Here we track the temporal and spatial dependence of electro-dissolution of single silver nanoparticles in order to study the role of surface oxide layers on electrochemical reactions. Heterogeneity in electrodissolution kinetics is observed by following the time-dependent loss in scattering intensity from individual silver nanoparticles using dark-field scattering. Both fast and slow dissolution kinetics are observed, with the dominant pathway changing as a function of applied potential. To understand this, superlocalization imaging is employed to follow the spatial variance of the electrodissolution process and reveals that the silver nanoparticles undergo electrodissolution in either a spatially symmetric or asymmetric manner. We hypothesize that asymmetric dissolution events are due to heterogeneity in the exposed silver sites on the nanoparticle surface because of incomplete surface oxide formation. Polarization-resolved measurements support this hypothesis by revealing anisotropic dissolution of the nanoparticles over time. By tracking the electrodissolution behavior of silver nanoparticles in both the temporal and spatial domains, we provide an improved understanding of how heterogeneity in electrochemical reactions is impacted by nanoparticle surface properties.

Application of Electrochemical Devices to Characterize the Dynamic Actions of Helicases on DNA	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; MODIFIED ELECTRODES; SINGLE-MOLECULE; EXCISION-REPAIR; MECHANISMS; RNA; PROTEIN; TFIIH; XPB; TRANSLOCASES	Much remains to be understood about the kinetics and thermodynamics of DNA helicase binding and activity. Here, we utilize probe-modified DNA monolayers on multiplexed gold electrodes as a sensitive recognition element and morphologically responsive transducer of helicase-DNA interactions. The electrochemical signals from these devices are highly sensitive to structural distortion of the DNA produced by the helicases. We used this DNA electrochemistry to distinguish the details of the DNA interactions of three distinct XPB helicases, which belong to the superfamily-2 of helicases. Clear changes in DNA melting temperature and duplex stability were observed upon helicase binding, shifts that could not be observed with conventional UV-visible absorption measurements. Binding dissociation constants were estimated in the range from 10 to 50 nM and correlated with observations of activity. ATP-stimulated DNA unwinding activity was also followed, revealing exponential time scales and distinct time constants associated with conventional and molecular wrench modes of operation further confirmed by crystal structures. These devices thus provide a sensitive measure of the structural thermodynamics and kinetics of helicase-DNA interactions.

Each porphyrin, represented as PorCo (where Por = TPP(NO2)Y-2 or TPP(NO2)Y-6 and Y = phenyl, phenylethynyl, Br, or CN) was shown to undergo multiple redox reactions involving the conjugated pi-ring system or central metal ion which could exist in a Co(III), Co(II), or Co(I) oxidation state under the application of an applied oxidizing or reducing potential. Thermodynamic half-wave potentials for the stepwise conversion between each oxidation state of [PorCo](n) (where n ranged from +3 to -3) were measured by cyclic voltammetry and analyzed as a function of the compound structure and properties of the electrochemical solvent. UV-visible spectra were obtained for each oxidized or reduced porphyrin in up to six different oxidation states ranging from [PorCo](3-) to [PorCo](3+) and analyzed as a function of the compound structure and utilized electrochemical solvent. Chemically or electrochemically generated Co(I) porphyrins are known to be highly reactive in solutions containing alkyl or aryl halides, and this property was utilized to in situ generate a new series of methyl carbon bonded cobalt(III) porphyrins with the same n-extending or highly electron-withdrawing substituents as the initial Co(II) derivatives. The electrosynthesized carbon-bonded Co(III) porphyrins were then characterized'as to their own electrochemical and spectroscopic properties after the addition of one, two, or three electrons in nonaqueous media.

Despite their deceptively simple appearances with just three active components (cathode and anode separated by electrolyte), the actual processes in LIBs involve complexities at all length scales, from Li+ migration within electrode lattices or across crystalline boundaries and interfaces to the Li+ accommodation and dislocation at potentials far away from the thermodynamic equilibria of electrolytes. Among all, the interphases situated between electrodes and electrolytes remain the most elusive component in LIBs Interphases form because no electrolyte component (salt anion, solvent molecules) could remain thermodynamically stable at the extreme potentials where electrodes in modern LIBs operate, and their chemical ingredients come from the sacrificial decompositions of electrolyte components. The presence of an interphase on electrodes ensures reversibility of Li+ intercalation chemistry in anode and cathode at extreme potentials and defines the cycle life, power and energy densities, and even safety of the eventual LIBs device. Despite such importance and numerous investigations dedicated in the past two decades, we still cannot explain why, nor predict whether, certain electrolyte solvents can form a protective interphase to support the reversible Li+ intercalation chemistries while others destroy the electrode structure. The most representative example is the long-standing "EC-PC Disparity" and the two interphasial extremities induced therefrom: differing by only one methyl substituent, ethylene carbonate (EC) forms almost ideal interphases on the' graphitic anode, thus becoming the indispensable solvent in all LIBs manufactured today, while propylene carbonate (PC) does not form any protective interphase, leading to catastrophic exfoliation of the graphitic structure. With one after another hypotheses proposed but none satisfactorily rationalizing this disparity on the molecular level, this mystery has been puzzling the battery and electrochemistry community for decades. In this Account, we attempted to decipher this mystery by reviewing the key factors that govern the interaction between the graphitic structure and the solvated Li+ right before interphase formation. Combining DFT calculation and experiments, we identified the partial desolvation of the solvated Li+ at graphite edge sites as a critical step, in which the competitive solvation of Li+ by anion and solvent molecules dictates whether an electrolyte is destined to form a protective interphase. Applying this model to the knowledge of relative Li+ solvation energy and frontier molecular orbital energy gap, it becomes theoretically possible now to predict whether a new solvent or anion would form a complex with Li+ leading to desirable interphases. Such molecular-level understanding of interphasial processes provides guiding principles to the effort of tailor-designing new electrolyte systems for more aggressive battery chemistries beyond Li-ion.

However, the limited fabrication methods of UMS restrict their wider catalytic applications. Here, we report on the synergy of unsaturated Zn and Cu dopants confined in carbon dots (ZnCu-CDs) to produce enhanced electron transfer and photooxidation processes in the doped CDs. The Zn/Cu species chelate with the carbon matrix mainly through Cu-O(N)-Zn-O(N)-Cu complexes. Within this structure, Cu2+ acts as a mild oxidizer that facilely increases the unsaturated Zn content and also precisely tunes the unsaturated Zn valence state to Znd+, where d is between 1 and 2, instead of Zn. With the help of UMS, electron-transfer pathways are produced, enhancing both the electron donating (7.0 times) and-accepting (5.3 times) abilities relative to conventional CDs. Because of these synergistic effects, the photocatalytic efficiency of CDs in photooxidation reactions is shown to improve more than 5-fold.

Electrochemistry is a robust technique for the analysis of single living cells that has the advantages of minor interruption of cellular activity and provides the capability of high spatiotemporal resolution. The achievements of the past 30 years have revealed significant information about the exocytotic events of single cells to elucidate the mechanisms of cellular activity. Currently, the rapid developments of micro/nanofabrication and optoelectronic technologies drive the development of multifunctional electrodes and novel electrochemical approaches with higher resolution for single cells. In this Perspective, three new frontiers in this field, namely, electrochemical microscopy, intracellular analysis, and single-cell analysis in a biological system (i.e., neocortex and retina), are reviewed. The unique features and remaining challenges of these techniques are discussed.

Here, we introduced enzyme-catalysis-induced polymer growth in nanochannels to develop a new method to regulate the ion transport and evaluate the enzyme catalysis kinetics in nano-space. As a model enzyme, Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was immobilized in the nanochannels through a volume-controlled-drying method. In the presence of H2O2, HRP catalyzed o-phenylenediamine (o-PD) to trigger its polymer growth, in turn blocked the ion transport and led to the decrease of the ion current. Taking advantages of the high efficiency of enzyme catalysis and the nano-confinement of nanochannels, the system readily achieved blocking ratios of ion current even reaching 99.6% of the initial. Based on above concept, we developed a new method to evaluate the enzyme catalysis kinetics in nano-confined space. By comparing with those in free state in solution and absorbed on planar surface, HRP confined in nanochannels presented similar apparent Michaelis constant (K-m) values for the substrate H2O2 but much higher K-m values for the substrate o-PD, due to the steric hindrance and diffusion suppression. The enzyme-catalysis-induced polymerization in nanochannels might lead to new concept for the nano-blocking/switching and provide a new platform for single molecule analysis and detection.

This paper pursues a detailed assessment of optimization-driven moving horizon estimation (MHE) framework by means of a reduced electrochemical model. For state-of-charge estimation, the standard MHE and two variants in the framework are examined by a comprehensive consideration of accuracy, computational intensity, effect of horizon size, and fault tolerance. A comparison with common extended Kalman filtering and unscented Kalman filtering is also carried out. Then, the feasibility and performance are demonstrated for accessing internal battery states unavailable in equivalent circuit models, such as solid-phase surface concentration and electrolyte concentration. Ultimately, a multiscale MHE-type scheme is created for State-of-Health estimation. This study is the first known systematic investigation of MHE-type estimators applied to battery management.

Electrochemical formic acid (HCOOH) oxidation is one such example. While the dehydration step in the indirect oxidation pathway (HCOOH -> H2O + COad -> 2H(+) + 2e(-) + CO2) is observed in the electrochemical oxidation of formic acid on Pt(111) surface, the surface science studies conducted in UHV condition reported the complete HCOOH dissociation to H-2 and CO2 on Pt(111) surface with no adsorbed CO at room temperature. A dehydration mechanism may also exist in gas-phase HCOOH dissociation in some conditions different from UHV, but it has not been demonstrated with a surface science method due to pressure limitations. Using ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS), we observed the dehydration mechanism of gas-phase HCOOH in unprecedented high pressure environment for the first time. This study is a demonstration of reconciling the disagreement between electrocatalysis and surface science by bridging the environment gap.

DFT calculations are associated with inherent uncertainty, which limits the ability to delineate materials (distinguishability) that possess high activity. Development of error-estimation capabilities in DFT has enabled uncertainty propagation through activity-prediction models. In this work, we demonstrate an approach to propagating uncertainty through thermodynamic activity models leading to a probability distribution of the computed activity and thereby its expectation value. A new metric, prediction efficiency, is defined, which provides a quantitative measure of the ability to distinguish activity of materials and can be used to identify the optimal descriptor(s) Delta G(opt). We demonstrate the framework for four important electrochemical reactions: hydrogen evolution, chlorine evolution, oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution. Future studies could utilize expected activity and prediction efficiency to significantly improve the prediction accuracy of highly active material candidates.

Durability of template-free Fe-N-C foams for electrochemical oxygen reduction in alkaline solution	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article							ELECTROLYTE FUEL-CELLS; DOPED CARBON FOAM; HEAT-TREATMENT; CATALYSTS; IRON; ELECTROCATALYSTS; ACID; ELECTROREDUCTION; PHTHALOCYANINES; STABILITY	Due to the high cost and limited availability of platinum, the development of non-platinum-group metals (non-PGM) catalysts is of paramount importance. A promising alternative to Pt are Fe-N-C-based materials. Here we present the synthesis, characterization and electrochemistry of a template-free nitrogen doped carbon foam, impregnated with iron. This low-cost and gram-scale method results in materials with micron-scale pore size and large surface area (1600 m(2)g(-1)). When applied as an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalyst in alkaline solution, the Fe-N-C foams display extremely high initial activity, slightly out-performing commercially available non-PGM catalysts (NCP-2000, Pajarito Powder). The load-cycle durability in alkaline solution is investigated, and the performance steadily degrades over 60,000 potential cycles, whilst the commercial catalyst is remarkably stable. The post-operation catalyst microstructure is elucidated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), to provide insight into the degradation processes. The resulting images suggest that potential cycling leads to leaching of atomically dispersed Fe-N-2/4 sites in all the catalysts, whereas encapsulated iron nanoparticles are protected.

The synthesized compounds 1-11 were characterized by spectroscopic and elemental analyses. These molecules show yellowish color in solution and are highly soluble in dichloromethane. Compound 7 shows a bandgap of 1.7eV and a Stokes shift of 27. From these results, we infer that this compound can serve as structural template in the design of organic electronics. Moreover, compound 7 shows higher T-d (370 degrees C) and T-g (132 degrees C) values, which reflect its high thermal stability.

Dynamic imaging of metastable reaction pathways in lithiated cobalt oxide electrodes	NANO ENERGY			English	Article						Metastable phase transformations; In-situ transmission electron microscopy; In-situ lithiation; Conversion reaction electrode; Lithium-ion battery; DFT calculation	INITIO MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; VOLTAGE HYSTERESIS; LITHIUM INSERTION; CONVERSION REACTIONS; CO3O4; TRANSITION; BATTERIES; CATHODE; ELECTROCHEMISTRY	Understanding how lithium-ion batteries function down to the atomic level during charge and discharge cycling can provide valuable guidance to optimize structure-property relationships and to design and understand new electrode materials. Lithium insertion and reactions with the electrodes during charge and discharge cycling can occur via metastable structures with complex ordering and related non-equilibrium phenomena. Remarkably, these processes remain still poorly understood despite their significance in the operation of lithium battery systems in critical technologies. In this communication, we present the dynamics of lithium insertion into Co3O4 and the evolution of metastable phases as probed by in-situ transmission electron microscopy, in concert with first principles density functional theory calculations. We show that the initial lithium intercalation reaction occurs with the formation of several metastable and intermediate phases, followed by a sequence of conversion reactions that perturb and expand the cubic-close-packed oxygen array, ultimately generating an end-product of finely dispersed cobalt metal clusters within a Li2O matrix. The calculated non-equilibrium lithiation pathways corroborate with the experimental lithiation voltages, and explain the significant hysteresis that occurs during electrochemical cycling. The data provide new insights into the complexity of solid state lithium electrochemistry in metal oxides that are relevant to advancing lithium battery technology.

By combining electrochemistry, ex situ and in situ spectroscopic techniques, density functional theory calculations, and a newly developed kinetic Monte Carlo model, we showed that Mo atoms are preferentially located on the vertex and edge sites of Mo-PtNi/C in the form of oxides, which are stable within the wide potential window of the electrochemical cycle. These surface Mo oxides stabilize adjacent Pt sites, hereby stabilizing the octahedral shape enriched with (111) facets, and lead to increased concentration of Ni in subsurface layers where they are protected against acid dissolution. Consequently, the favorable Pt3Ni(111) structure for the ORR is stabilized on the surface of PtNi/C NPs in acid against voltage cycling. Significantly, the unusual potential-dependent oxygen coverage trend on Mo-doped PtNi/C NPs as revealed by the surface-sensitive Delta mu analysis suggests that the Mo dopants may also improve the ORR kinetics by modifying the coordination environments of Pt atoms on the surface. Our studies point out a possible way to stabilize the favorable shape and composition established on conceptual catalytic models in practical nanoscale catalysts.

Here we quantify the effects of an inorganic" additive on the Morphology of an evolving electrochemical growth front, using liquid cell electron microscopy to provide the necessary spatial and temporal "resolution. We examine deposition of ZnAu on Au in the presence of Bi additive, and show that low concentrations of Bi delay but do not prevent the formation of growth-front instabilities. We describe a model in which Bi segregates at the growth front and promotes the surface diffusion arid relaxation of Zn, allowing better coverage of the initial Au electrode surface. A more precise knowledge of the mechanism of inorganic additive effects may help in designing electrolyte chemistry for battery and other applications where morphology control is essential.

In particular, we highlight our recent contribution on the electrocatalytic diazidation of olefins as a general, selective, and sustainable method for the synthesis of vicinal diamines. 1 Introduction 2 Background: Intermolecular Diamination of Olefins 3 Background: Intermolecular Diazidation of Olefins 4 Electrocatalytic Diazidation of Olefins	[Parry, Joseph B.; Fu, Niankai; Lin, Song] Cornell Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, 259 East Ave, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Lin, Song] Cornell Univ, Atkinson Ctr Sustainable Future, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA	Lin, S (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, 259 East Ave, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.; Lin, S (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Atkinson Ctr Sustainable Future, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.	songlin@cornell.edu	Lin, Song/F-5472-2014	Lin, Song/0000-0002-8880-6476; Fu, Niankai/0000-0002-7453-3569; Parry, Joseph/0000-0001-5979-6814	Cornell University; Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future	Financial support was provided by Cornell University and the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future.		93	38	38	17	60	GEORG THIEME VERLAG KG	STUTTGART	RUDIGERSTR 14, D-70469 STUTTGART, GERMANY	0936-5214	1437-2096		SYNLETT	Synlett	FEB	2018	29	3					257	265		10.1055/s-0036-1591749			9	Chemistry, Organic	Chemistry	FU6XX	WOS:000423997400006			Y	N	2020-03-10

Controlling Chemical Reactions in Confined Environments: Water Dissociation in MOF-74	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						metal organic framework; reaction mechanism; confined environment	METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORKS; MINIMUM ENERGY PATHS; ELASTIC BAND METHOD; SADDLE-POINTS; ADSORPTION; COORDINATION; SURFACES; SEPARATIONS; CHEMISTRY; MECHANISM	The confined porous environment of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) is an attractive system for studying reaction mechanisms. Compared to flat oxide surfaces, MOFs have the key advantage that they exhibit a well-defined structure and present significantly fewer challenges in experimental characterization. As an example of an important reaction, we study here the dissociation of water-which plays a critical role in biology, chemistry, and materials science-in MOFs and show how the knowledge of the structure in this confined environment allows for an unprecedented level of understanding and control. In particular, combining in-situ infrared spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, we show that the water dissociation reaction can be selectively controlled inside Zn-MOF-74 by alcohol, through both chemical and physical interactions. Methanol is observed to speed up water dissociation by 25% to 100%, depending on the alcohol partial pressure. On the other hand, co-adsorption of isopropanol reduces the speed of the water reaction, due mostly to steric interactions. In addition, we also investigate the stability of the product state after the water dissociation has occurred and find that the presence of additional water significantly stabilizes the dissociated state. Our results show that precise control of reactions within nano-porous materials is possible, opening the way for advances in fields ranging from catalysis to electrochemistry and sensors.

Inflow of oxygen and glucose in brain tissue induced by intravenous norepinephrine: relationships with central metabolic and peripheral vascular responses	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						adrenoceptors; brain metabolism; brain thermorecording; neurovascular coupling; oxygen electrochemistry; vasoconstriction; visceral sensory signal	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; PHYSIOLOGICAL FLUCTUATIONS; TEMPERATURE HOMEOSTASIS; AROUSING STIMULI; ANESTHESIA; RECEPTORS; NERVES; ACTIVATION; PRESSURE	As an essential part of sympathetic activation that prepares the organism for "fight or flight," peripheral norepinephrine (NE) plays an important role in regulating cardiac activity and the tone of blood vessels, increasing blood flow to the heart and the brain and decreasing blood flow to the organs not as necessary for immediate survival. To assess whether this effect is applicable to the brain, we used high-speed amperometry to measure the changes in nucleus accumbens (NAc) levels of oxygen and glucose induced by intravenous injections of NE in awake freely moving rats. We found that NE at low doses (2-18 mu g/kg) induces correlative increases in NAc oxygen and glucose, suggesting local vasodilation and enhanced entry of these substances in brain tissue from the arterial blood. By using temperature recordings from the NAc, temporal muscle, and skin, we show that this central effect is associated with strong skin vasoconstriction and phasic increases in intrabrain heat production, indicative of metabolic neural activation. A tight direct correlation between NE-induced changes in metabolic activity and NAc levels of oxygen and glucose levels suggests that local cerebral vasodilation is triggered via a neurovascular coupling mechanism. Our data suggest that NE, by changing vascular tone and cardiac activity, triggers a visceral sensory signal that rapidly reaches the central nervous system via sensory nerves and induces neural activation. This neural activation leads to a chain of neurovascular events that promote entry of oxygen and glucose in brain tissue, thus preventing any possible metabolic deficit during functional activation. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Using high-speed amperometry and ther-morecording in freely moving rats, we demonstrate that intravenous norepinephrine at physiological doses induces rapid correlative increases in nucleus accumbens oxygen and glucose levels coupled with increased intrabrain heat production. Although norepinephrine cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, by changing cardiac activity and vascular tone, it creates a sensory signal that reaches the central nervous system via sensory nerves, induces neural activation, and triggers a chain of neurovascular events that promotes intrabrain entry of oxygen and glucose.

With the help of online electrochemical mass spectrometry, the complex is demonstrated to be active as a water oxidation catalyst. Comparing the results obtained for different electrode materials shows a clear substrate influence of the electrode, as the complex shows a significantly lower catalytic overpotential on graphitic working electrodes in comparison to other electrode materials. Cyclic voltammetry experiments provide evidence that the structure of complex 1 undergoes reversible changes under high-potential conditions, regenerating the original structure of complex 1 upon returning to lower potentials. Results from electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance experiments rule out that catalysis proceeds via deposition of catalytically active material on the electrode surface.

A Hydrogen-Bromate Flow Battery for Air-Deficient Environments	ENERGY TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						catalysis; electrochemistry; energy storage; flow batteries; fuel cells	STATIONARY 1D REGIME; FUEL-CELL; ENERGY-STORAGE; ELECTROREDUCTION; MODEL; PERFORMANCE; ELECTRODE; PROGRESS; SYSTEM; ANIONS	A concept of high energy density (ED) hydrogen-bromate flow battery was supported by experiments with flow cells with 0.1 to 50 cm(2) apparent areas. H-2/NaBrO3 flow cells with H-2 gas diffusion anode, proton exchange membrane (PEM), and carbonaceous flow-by or flow-through cathodes were employed. Estimates show that the theoretical ED of the H-2/bromate flow battery (HBFB) exceeds the ED of H-2/O-2 fuel cells (FC) in air-deficient environments. At the cathode of the HBFB, aqueous, concentrated bromate (non-toxic, and stable) is reduced to bromide by a six-electron process. 100% conversion of BrO3- to Br- can be achieved. Although acidification of the BrO3- electrolyte is a prerequisite, the acid concentration in the electrolyte feed can be optimized as a trade-off between area specific power (P) of the HBFB and its complexity.

Evidence for an Electronic State at the Interface between the SnO2 Core and the TiO2 Shell in Mesoporous SnO2/TiO2 Thin Films	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						core/shell; semiconductor; electronic state position; solar energy conversion; water-splitting	SENSITIZED SOLAR-CELLS; CONDUCTION-BAND ELECTRONS; ATOMIC LAYER DEPOSITION; OPTICAL ELECTROCHEMISTRY; RECOMBINATION DYNAMICS; NANOCRYSTALLINE TIO2; OXIDE; INJECTION; ULTRAFAST; SEMICONDUCTORS	A comparative spectroelectrochemical study of micron thick mesoporous thin films composed of TiO2 and SnO2 nanocrystallites was undertaken to identify the location and identity of electronic state(s) in core/shell SnO2/TiO2 films that have emerging applications in energy science. The mesoporous TiO2 and SnO2 films were synthesized by sol gel techniques, and the core/shell material was created by atomic layer deposition of a TiO2 shell on a SnO2 core. Electro-chemical reduction of these materials in aqueous electrolytes resulted in a blue shift of the fundamental VB -> CB absorbance as well as a broad absorbance across the visible region. For SnO2, three unique spectra were required to model the potential dependent data while only one unique spectrum was needed to model the corresponding data for SnO2/TiO2 and TiO2. Significantly, standard addition of the spectra measured for SnO2 and TiO2 did not model that for SnO2/TiO2. In other words, upon reduction of SnO2/TiO2 there was no spectroscopic evidence for electrons residing in the SnO2 core or in the TiO2 shell. Instead, the appearance of a single potential-independent absorption spectrum was observed and attributed to electrons present within an interfacial region between the core and the shell. The charge extraction technique was used to determine that the density of SnO2/TiO2 states was more similar to that of TiO2 than SnO2. The potential onset followed the trend SnO2/TiO2 > SnO2 > TiO2, with TiO2 closest to the vacuum level and SnO2/TiO2 the furthest away. The implications of these results for solar energy conversion are discussed.

Single-step fabrication of electrodes with controlled nanostructured surface roughness using optically-induced electrodeposition	JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING			English	Article						nanoparticles; optically-induced electrodeposition; microelectrodes; electrocatalyst	GOLD NANOPARTICLES; GROWTH; SERS; NANOCOMPOSITES; NANORODS; GLUCOSE; SILVER; ELECTROKINETICS; MICROPARTICLES; MANIPULATION	The customized fabrication of microelectrodes from gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) has attracted much attention due to their numerous applications in chemistry and biomedical engineering, such as for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and as catalyst sites for electrochemistry. Herein, we present a novel optically-induced electrodeposition (OED) method for rapidly fabricating gold electrodes which are also surface-modified with nanoparticles in one single step. The electrodeposition mechanism, with respect to the applied AC voltage signal and the elapsed deposition time, on the resulting morphology and particle sizes was investigated. The results from SEM and AFM analysis demonstrated that 80-200 nm gold particles can be formed on the surface of the gold electrodes. Simultaneously, both the size of the nanoparticles and the roughness of the fabricated electrodes can be regulated by the deposition time. Compared to state-of-the-art methods for fabricating microelectrodes with AuNPs, such as nano-seed-mediated growth and conventional electrodeposition, this OED technique has several advantages including: (1) electrode fabrication and surface modification using nanoparticles are completed in a single step, eliminating the need for prefabricating micro electrodes; (2) the patterning of electrodes is defined using a digitally-customized, projected optical image rather than using fixed physical masks; and (3) both the fabrication and surface modification processes are rapid, and the entire fabrication process only requires less than 6 s.

However, what has escaped the attention of the scientific community is the unique chemistry of monolayer TMDs. It has been demonstrated that the basal plane of multilayer TMDs is chemically inert, whereas edge sites are chemically active. In this article, we experimentally demonstrate that the edge reactivity of the TMDs can be significantly impeded at the monolayer limit through monolayer/substrate interaction,. thus making the monolayers highly resistant to electrooxidation and corrosion. In particular, we found that few layer flakes of MoS2 and WS2 exfoliated on conductive TiN substrates are readily corroded beyond a certain, positive electrode potential, while monolayer remnants are left behind unscathed. The electrooxidation resistance of monolayers was confirmed using a plethora of characterization techniques including atomic force microscope (AFM) imaging, Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL) mapping, scanning/transmission electron microscope (S/TEM) imaging, and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). It is believed that strong substrate monolayer interaction compared to the relatively weak interlayer van der Waals interaction is responsible for the superior monolayers chemical stability in highly corrosive oxidizing environments. Our findings could pave the way for the implementation of monolayer transition metal disulfides as superior anticorrosion coating which can have a significant socioeconomic impact.

Quasi-reference electrodes in confined electrochemical cells can result in in situ production of metallic nanoparticles	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ENZYME MOLECULE ELECTROCHEMISTRY; DIFFUSION-CONTROLLED GROWTH; NANOMETER-SIZED ELECTRODES; WALLED CARBON NANOTUBES; NANOSCALE ELECTROCHEMISTRY; SILVER NANOPARTICLES; INDIVIDUAL NANOPARTICLES; GOLD NANOPARTICLES; ENERGY-CONVERSION; FILM VOLTAMMETRY	Nanoscale working electrodes and miniaturized electroanalytical devices are valuable platforms to probe molecular phenomena and perform chemical analyses. However, the inherent close distance of metallic electrodes integrated into a small volume of electrolyte can complicate classical electroanalytical techniques. In this study, we use a scanning nanopipette contact probe as a model miniaturized electrochemical cell to demonstrate measurable side effects of the reaction occurring at a quasi-reference electrode. We provide evidence for in situ generation of nanoparticles in the absence of any electroactive species and we critically analyze the origin, nucleation, dissolution and dynamic behavior of these nanoparticles as they appear at the working electrode. It is crucial to recognize the implications of using quasi-reference electrodes in confined electrochemical cells, in order to accurately interpret the results of nanoscale electrochemical experiments.

J	Xiao, N; Rooney, RT; Gewirth, AA; Wu, YY				Xiao, Neng; Rooney, Ryan T.; Gewirth, Andrew A.; Wu, Yiying			The Long-Term Stability of KO2 in K-O-2 Batteries	ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION			English	Article						analytical methods; electrolytes; potassium-oxygen batteries; shelf-life; superoxide chemistry	LITHIUM-OXYGEN BATTERY; DISCHARGE PRODUCTS; NONAQUEOUS LI-O-2; NA-O-2 BATTERIES; SIDE REACTIONS; SUPEROXIDE; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; GENERATION; MECHANISMS; INSIGHTS	The rechargeable K-O-2 battery is recognized as a promising energy storage solution owing to its large energy density, low overpotential, and high coulombic efficiency based on the single-electron redox chemistry of potassium superoxide. However, the reactivity and long-term stability of potassium superoxide remains ambiguous in K-O-2 batteries. Parasitic reactions are explored and the use of ion chromatography to quantify trace amounts of side products is demonstrated. Both quantitative titrations and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry confirm the highly reversible single-electron transfer process, with 98% capacity attributed to the formation and decomposition of KO2. In contrast to the Na-O-2 counterparts, remarkable shelf-life is demonstrated for K-O-2 batteries owing to the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of KO2, which prevents the spontaneous disproportionation to peroxide. This work sheds light on the reversible electrochemical process of K+ + e(-) + O-2 <-> KO2.

Ion channels embedded in cell membranes, for example, provide pathways, where electron and proton transfer are coupled to the exchange of vital molecules. Learning from mother nature, a recent surge in activity has focused on artificial nanopore architectures to effect electrochemical transformations not accessible in larger structures. Here, we highlight these exciting advances. Starting with a brief overview of nanopore electrodes, including the early history and development of nanopore sensing based on nanopore-confined electrochemistry, we address the core concepts and special characteristics of nanopores in electron transfer. We describe nanopore-based electrochemical sensing and processing, discuss performance limits and challenges, and conclude with an outlook for next-generation nanopore electrode sensing platforms and the opportunities they present.

Unveiling the Structural Evolution of Ag1.2Mn8O16 under Coulombically Controlled (De)Lithiation	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							CATHODE MATERIALS; MANGANESE-DIOXIDE; SILVER HOLLANDITE; LITHIUM INSERTION; ALPHA-MNO2; ION; BATTERIES; NANORODS; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; PERFORMANCE	MnO2 materials are considered promising cathode materials for rechargeable lithium, sodium, and magnesium batteries due to their earth abundance and environmental friendliness. One polymorph of MnO2, alpha-MnO2, has 2 X 2 tunnels (4.6 angstrom x 4.6 angstrom) in its structural framework, which provide facile diffusion pathways for guest ions. In this work, a silver-ion-containing alpha-MnO2 (Ag1.2Mn8O16) is examined as a candidate cathode material for Li based batteries. Electrochemical stability of Ag1.2Mn8O16 is investigated through Coulombically controlled reduction under 2 or 4 molar electron equivalents (e.e.). Terminal discharge voltage remains almost constant under 2 e.e. of cycling, whereas it continuously decreases under repetitive reduction by 4 e.e. Thus, detailed structural analyses were utilized to investigate the structural evolution upon lithiation. Significant increases in lattice a (17.7%) and atomic distances (similar to 4.8%) are observed when x in LixAg1.2Mn8O16 is >4. Ag metal forms at this level of lithiation concomitant with a large structural distortion to the Mn-O framework. In contrast, lattice a only expands by 2.2% and Mn-O/Mn-Mn distances show minor changes (similar to 1.4%) at x < 2. The structural deformation (tunnel breakage) at x > 4 inhibits the recovery of the original structure, leading to poor cycle stability at high lithiation levels. This report establishes the correlation among local structure changes, amorphization processes, formation of Ag-0, and long-term cycle stability for this silver-containing alpha-MnO2 type material at both low and high lithiation levels.

The morphology of material was characterized with various microscopic analyses. The graphitic carbon showed metal nanoparticles dispersed on the nanocomposite that could be clearly differentiated. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated the Mn species reduced from +4 to +3 oxidation state, while Ni species remained as NiO, which was further supported by X-ray diffraction. The electrochemical behavior of NiO-Mn2O3/C toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline medium was investigated via cyclic voltammetry (CV). CVs revealed a ORR peak at 0.67V vs. RHE with significantly high current density. Hydrodynamic studies indicated that NiO-Mn2O3/C catalyzed ORR via a four-electron reduction pathway. A high rate constant in the order of magnitude of 10(6) mol(-1)s(-1) was obtained for ORR. This low-cost, environmentally friendly and stable ORR catalyst derived from chitosan and doped with metal oxides proved to be a promising electrocatalyst for ORR and could alternatively find its application in alkaline fuel cells (AFCs).

Building Organic/Inorganic Hybrid Interphases for Fast Interfacial Transport in Rechargeable Metal Batteries	ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION			English	Article						electrochemistry; interfaces; interfacial transport; lithium-sulfur batteries; organic-inorganic hybrid composites	LI-ION BATTERIES; LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; NEGATIVE ELECTRODES; DENDRITE GROWTH; ANODE; ELECTROLYTES; POLYSULFIDE; COMPOSITES; DEPOSITION; REDUCTION	We report a facile in situ synthesis that utilizes readily accessible SiCl4 cross-linking chemistry to create durable hybrid solid-electrolyte interphases (SEIs) on metal anodes. Such hybrid SEIs composed of Si-interlinked OOCOR molecules that host LiCl salt exhibit fast charge-transfer kinetics and as much as five-times higher exchange current densities, in comparison to their spontaneously formed analogues. Electrochemical analysis and direct optical visualization of Li and Na deposition in symmetric Li/Li and Na/Na cells show that the hybrid SEI provides excellent morphological control at high current densities (3-5 mA cm(-2)) for Li and even for notoriously unstable Na metal anodes. The fast interfacial transport attributes of the SEI are also found to be beneficial for Li-S cells and stable electrochemical cycling was achieved in galvanostatic studies at rates as high as 2 C. Our work therefore provides a promising approach towards rational design of multifunctional, elastic SEIs that overcome the most serious limitations of spontaneously formed interphases on high-capacity metal anodes.

We have recently found that the C-S linkage can be cleaved with Pt(II) and Au(I), something that was not previously recognized. In this current work, we examine the structure, properties, and reactivity of 5-arylthio-5H-chromenopyridines using spectroscopy, crystallography, reactivity, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and electrochemistry. We report the crystal structures of 5-arylthio-5H-chromenopyridines, as well as their DFT-calculated structures and electronic structures. The DFT calculations help to explain the electronic properties of these complexes, such as the observation that "soft" metals cleave the C-S bond. We find that the arylthio group is a good leaving group on these molecules due to the stability of the carbocation that is formed, and can be removed via reduction with NaBH4. Methoxy-substituted chromenopyridines were found to be viable at inhibiting liver fibrosis. These results will help inform the biological studies with these compounds to determine method of action and enhance development of new drug molecules with increased stability and activity based on the 5H-chromenopyridine scaffold.

Structural Tuning of Boron Difluoride Formazanate Electrochemiluminescence Mediated by Tri-n-propylamine	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							ELECTROCHEMICAL BAND-GAPS; ELECTROGENERATED CHEMILUMINESCENCE; ORGANIC NANOPARTICLES; COMPLEXES; LIGAND; CHEMISTRY; DYES; DERIVATIVES; CATION; STATES	Electrochemistry and electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) of boron difluoride formazanate complexes bearing p-methoxyphenyl N-substituents were studied experimentally and computationally. It was shown that the substituents at the 3-position (R-3) of the formazanate backbone play a critical role in the electrochemistry and ECL of the complexes in the presence of tri-n-propylamine (TPrA). The ECL emission of la (R-3 = cyano), lb (R-3 = phenyl), and 1c (R-3 = p-C6H4OMe) occurred at peak wavelengths of 724 nm (1.71 eV), 704 nm (1.76 eV), and 723 nm (1.71 eV), consistent with their photoluminescence maxima. The maximum ECL quantum yields, determined relative to the [Ru(bpy)(3)](2)/TPrA system, were, 450% for la, 244% for lb, and 94% for lc, respectively. The relatively large Stokes shifts of la lc were linked to the flattening of these molecules which accompanies their electronic excitation. Through the use of spooling ECL spectroscopy, it was demonstrated that the intensity and relative energies of ECL emission from boron difluoride formazanate complexes can be readily tuned via structure modification, variation in applied potential, and/or scan rate.

Applied Potentials in Variable-Charge Reactive Force Fields for Electrochemical Systems	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS; MANY-BODY POTENTIALS; COMPUTER-SIMULATION; LIQUID WATER; DOUBLE-LAYER; INTERFACE; MODEL; ELECTRONEGATIVITY; ELECTRODES; SURFACES	An atomic description of water dynamics and electrochemical properties at electrode-electrolyte interfaces is presented using molecular dynamics with the third generation of the charge-optimized many-body (COMB3) potential framework. Externally applied potentials in electrochemical applications were simulated by offsetting electronegativity on electrode atoms. This approach is incorporated into the variable charge scheme within COMB3 and is used to investigate electrochemical systems consisting of two Cu electrodes and a water electrolyte with varying concentrations of hydroxyls (OH-) and protons (H+). The interactions between the electronegativity offset method and the charge equilibration method in a variable charge scheme are analyzed. In addition, a charge equilibration method for electrochemical applications is proposed, where the externally applied potentials are treated by the electronegativity offset on the electrodes thus enforcing charge neutrality on the electrolyte. This method is able to qualitatively capture the relevant electrochemistry and predict consistently correct voltages with precalibration.

J	White, W; Sanborn, CD; Fabian, DM; Ardo, S				White, William; Sanborn, Christopher D.; Fabian, David M.; Ardo, Shane			Conversion of Visible Light into Ionic Power Using Photoacid-Dye-Sensitized Bipolar Ion-Exchange Membranes	JOULE			English	Article							ELECTROCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION; PROTON-TRANSFER; SOLAR-CELLS; FUEL-CELLS; TRANSPORT; ANION; MIXTURES; KINETICS; JUNCTION; SYSTEMS	For over half a century, it has been recognized that the classical physics that dictates the behavior of hydrated ion-exchange membranes, such as Nafion, and semiconductors, such as doped silicon, are similar. However, no demonstrations of photovoltaic action from ion-exchange materials existed. We recently reported a synthetic light-driven proton pump derived from an ion-exchange membrane. Absorption of light by covalently bound photoacid molecules resulted in photovoltaic action. This design lacked a second permselective membrane contact, which limited its performance. Here, we report a similar to 60-fold increase in the photovoltage through use of a bipolar membrane structure consisting of a cation-exchange membrane affixed to an anion-exchange membrane. The junction between the layers was characterized in detail using electrochemistry, scanning electron microscopy, spectroscopy, and thermal gravimetric analysis. Our results represent considerable progress toward a device that directly converts sunlight into ionic electricity, which has implications for direct solar desalination of salt water.

To facilitate the practical realization of the sodium-ion technology, the energy density of sodium-ion batteries needs to be boosted to the level of current commercial Li-ion batteries. An effective approach would be to elevate the operating voltage of the battery, which requires the use of electrochemically stable cathode materials with high voltage versus Na+/Na. This review summarizes the recent progress with the emerging high-voltage cathode materials for room-temperature sodium-ion batteries, which include layered transitional-metal oxides, Na-rich materials, and polyanion compounds. The key challenges and corresponding strategies for these materials are also discussed, with an emphasis placed on the intrinsic structural properties, Na storage electrochemistry, and the voltage variation tendency with respect to the redox reactions. The insights presented in this article can serve as a guide for improving the energy densities of room-temperature Na-ion batteries.

Although ZnO grew along the a- and c-axes, however, the anisotropic crystal growth mechanism of ZnO particles was investigated by the ratio of precursor and temperature of the reaction. The characterizations of three ZnO particles were measured by Field emission scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. In addition, ZnO with three shapes was fixed on gold-printed circuit board to detect their electrochemistry property in a 3% H2O2/phosphate buffer, while ZnO/GO (graphene oxide) composite was obtained by organic linking which showed the different electrochemical results compare to that of ZnO. electron-transfer distance and speed have been changed between the products and support due to the combination of ZnO and GO. The exploration of ZnO of different shape and ZnO/GO composites on their features and properties would provide significant evidence for their application as sensors in extensive fields.

J	Brown, JH				Brown, Jay H.			Electrochemical reduction of terbuthylazine under acidic conditions and structural determination of post-electrolysis product with the aid of GC/MS, IR, and H-1 NMR spectroscopy	JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Electrochemistry; Reduction; Triazine; Terbuthylazine	S-TRIAZINE HERBICIDES; MERCURY-ELECTRODES; ATRAZINE; ELECTROREDUCTION	Terbuthylazine (N-t-butyl-6-chloro-N'-ethyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine) is an important chloro-s-triazine herbicide that is used to prevent the growth of weeds during the production of a variety of crops in several European nations. The compound is also used as an algaecide to inhibit the growth of algae in water-cooling ponds and towers in the United States. These compounds can undergo electrochemical reduction under acidic conditions. Reduction pathways for several chloro-s-triazine herbicides have been proposed based on a variety of electrochemical, chromatographic, and spectroscopic techniques. There was general agreement in the literature that protonated forms of these compounds undergo a 4-electron reduction. The proposed reactions were elimination of the chloro group, elimination of an alkyl or alkylamino group, and reduction of the s-triazine ring. The present paper describes an electrochemical study of terbuthylazine with subsequent analyses of the post-electrolysis product by means of GC/MS, IR, and H-1 NMR spectroscopy. This work provides evidence for a 4-electron reduction involving elimination of the chloro group and reduction of the s-triazine ring.

Fraser			X-Shaped Oligomeric Pyromellitimide Polyradicals	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							NAPHTHALENE DIIMIDES; PI-STACKS; ORGANIC DIRADICALS; IMIDE; ANION; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; SPECTROSCOPY; SPECTRA; VISUALIZATION; TRANSPORT	The synthesis of stable organic polyradicals is important for the development of magnetic materials. Herein we report the synthesis, isolation, and characterization of a series of X-shaped pyromellitimide (PI) oligomers (X-n-R, n = 2-4, R = Hex or Ph) linked together by single C-C bonds between their benzenoid cores. We hypothesize that these oligomers might form high-spin states in their reduced forms because of the nearly orthogonal conformations adopted by their PI units.H- 1 and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies confirmed the isolation of the dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric homologues. X-ray crystallography shows that X-2-Ph crystallizes into a densely packed superstructure, despite the criss-crossed conformations adopted by the molecules. Electrochemical experiments, carried out on the oligomers X-n-Hex, reveal that the reductions of the PI units occur at multiple distinct potentials, highlighting the weak electronic coupling between the adjacent redox centers. Finally, the chemically generated radical anion and polyanion states, X-n-Hex(center dot- )and X-n-Hex(n()(center dot-)), respectively, were probed extensively by UV-vis-NIR absorption, EPR, and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopies. The ENDOR spectra of the radical monoanions X-n-Hex(center dot-) reveal that the unpaired electron is largely localized on a single PI unit. Further reductions of X-n-Hex(center dot-) yield EPR signals (in frozen solutions) that can be assigned to spin-spin interactions in X-2-Hex(2()(center dot-)), X-3-Hex(3(center dot-)), and X-4-Hex(4()(center dot-)). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that directly linking the benzene rings of PIs with a single C-C bond is a viable method for generating stabilized high-spin organic anionic polyradicals.

Ru-qdppz possesses electronically isolated proximal and distal qdppz-based excited states; the former is initially generated and decays to the latter, which repopulates the ground state with tau = 362 ps. In contrast, excitation of Ru-qdpq results in the population of a relatively long-lived (tau = 19 ns) Ru(d pi) -> qdpq(pi*) (MLCT)-M-3 excited state where the promoted electron is delocalized throughout the qdpq ligand. Ultrafast spectroscopy, used together with steady-state absorption, electrochemistry, and DFT calculations, indicates that the unique coordination modes of the qdpq and qdppz ligands impart substantially different electronic communication throughout the quinone-containing ligand, affecting the excited state and electron transfer properties of these molecules. These observations create a pathway to synthesize complexes with red-shifted absorptions that possess long-lived, redox-active excited states that are useful for various applications, including solar energy conversion and photochemotherapy.

Previous work showed that introduction of poly [3-(potassium-4-butanoate) thiophene] (PPBT) as a binder component coupled with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) surface coating on magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles enhanced electron and ion transport in the high capacity anode system. Here, the impact of Fe3O4 crystallite size (10 nm vs. 20 nm) and surface chemistry were explored to evaluate their effects on interfacial interactions within the composite PEG/PPBT based electrodes and resultant battery performance. The Fe3O4 synthesis methods inevitably lead to differences in surface chemistry. For instance, the Fe3O4 particles synthesized using ammonium hydroxide appeared more dispersed, and afforded improved rate capability performance. Notably, chemical interactions between the active nanoparticles and PPBT binder were only seen with particles synthesized using triethylamine. Capacity retention and cycling performance were unaffected. This study provides fundamental insights into the significant impact of active material synthesis on the design and fabrication of composite battery electrodes. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Tuning Enzyme/alpha-Zr(IV) Phosphate Nanoplate Interactions via Chemical Modification of Glucose Oxidase	LANGMUIR			English	Article							SURFACE-PLASMON RESONANCE; ALPHA-ZIRCONIUM PHOSPHATE; ENTHALPY-ENTROPY COMPENSATION; PROTEIN MODIFICATION; DIRECT ELECTROCHEMISTRY; ENZYME IMMOBILIZATION; DRUG-DELIVERY; BIOSENSOR APPLICATIONS; CARBON NANOTUBES; SENSOR	Using glucose oxidase (GOx) and alpha-Zr(IV) phosphate nanoplates (alpha-ZrP) as a model system, a generally applicable approach to control enzyme-solid interactions via chemical modification of amino acid side chains of the enzyme is demonstrated. Net charge on GOx was systematically tuned by appending different amounts of polyamine to the protein surface to produce chemically modified GOx(n), where n is the net charge on the enzyme after the modification and ranged from -62 to +95 electrostatic units in the system. The binding of GOx(n) with alpha-ZrP nanosheets was studied by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) as well as by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy. Pristine GOx showed no affinity for the alpha-ZrP nanosheets, but GOx(n) where n >= -20 showed binding affinities exceeding (2.1 +/- 0.6) X 10(6) M-1, resulting from the charge modification of the enzyme. A plot of GOx(n) charge vs Gibbs free energy of binding (Delta G) for n = +20 to n = +65 indicated an overall increase in favorable interaction between GOx(n) and alpha-ZrP nanosheets. However, Delta G is less dependent on the net charge for n > +45, as evidenced by the decrease in the slope as charge increased further. All modified enzyme samples and enzyme/alpha-ZrP complexes retained a significant amount of folding structure (examined by circular dichroism) as well as enzymatic activities. Thus, strong control over enzyme-nanosheet interactions via modulating the net charge of enzymes may find potential applications in biosensing and biocatalysis.

Bias-dependent local structure of water molecules at a metallic interface	CHEMICAL SCIENCE			English	Article							FORCES	Understanding the local structure of water at the interfaces of metallic electrodes is a key issue in aqueousbased electrochemistry. Nevertheless a realistic simulation of such a setup is challenging, particularly when the electrodes are maintained at different potentials. To correctly compute the effect of an external bias potential applied to truly semi-infinite surfaces, we combine Density Functional Theory (DFT) and NonEquilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) methods. This framework allows for the out-of-equilibrium calculation of forces and dynamics, and directly correlates to the chemical potential of the electrodes, which is introduced experimentally. In this work, we apply this methodology to study the electronic properties and atomic forces of a water molecule at the interface of a gold surface. We find that the water molecule tends to align its dipole moment with the electric field, and it is either repelled or attracted to the metal depending on the sign and magnitude of the applied bias, in an asymmetric fashion.

IPMCs can undergo large deformations under modest voltage inputs, in dry and wet environments. Past studies have demonstrated that physical and geometric properties of all the IPMC constituents (ionomer, electrodes, and counterions) may all influence the time scales of the transient response and severity of the back-relaxation. In this study, we present a detailed mathematical model to investigate how the finite size of the counterions and the presence of metal particles in the vicinity of the electrodes modulate IPMC actuation. We build on previous work by our group on thermodynamically consistent modeling of IPMC mechanics and electrochemistry, which attributes IPMC actuation to the interplay between Maxwell stress and osmotic forces. To gain insight into the role of physical and geometric parameters, the resulting nonlinear partial differential equations are solved semianalytically using the method of matched asymptotic expansions, for the initial transient and the steadystate. A numerical solution in COMSOL Multiphysics VR is developed to verify semianalytical findings and further explore IPMC actuation. Our model can successfully predict the entire response of IPMCs, from the initial bending toward the anode to the steady-state toward the cathode. We find that the steric effect can abolish the back-relaxation of IPMCs by restraining the counterions' concentration near the electrodes. We also find that increasing the thickness of the ionomer-metal composite layers may enhance IPMC actuation through increased osmotic forces and Maxwell stress. Published by AIP Publishing.

The oxidation step of the catalytic cycle is probed through cyclic voltammetry and bulk electrolysis studies of a preformed palladacycle of 8-methylquinoline. A catalytic system for C-H acetoxylation is then developed and optimized with respect to the cell configuration, rate of oxidation, and chemistry at the counter electrode. This transformation is then applied to substrates containing various directing groups and to the acetoxylation of both C(sp(2)) H and C(sp(3))-H bonds.

Here, we employ a novel divergent approach for selective preparation of a variety of bimetallic complexes within a ditopic macrocyclic ligand platform. In our approach, nickel is readily coordinated to a Schiff base cavity, and then a range of redox-inactive cations (M=Na+, Ca2+, Nd3+, and Y3+) are installed in a pendant crown-ether-like site. This modular strategy allows access to complexes with the highly Lewis acidic trivalent cations Nd3+ and Y3+, a class of compounds that were previously inaccessible. Spectroscopic and electrochemical studies reveal wide variations in properties that are governed most strongly by the trivalent cations. Exposure to dimethylformamide drives loss of Nd3+ and Y3+ from the pendant crown-ether site, suggesting solvent effects must be carefully considered in future applications involving use of highly Lewis acidic metals.

The compounds show low melting points, 76 degrees and 125 degrees C, respectively, and were characterized by spectroscopic techniques H-1-NMR, mass spectrometry, FT-IR spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and XRD crystallographic analysis. Cyclic voltammetry results demonstrate that both salts have a quasi-reversible electrochemical behavior, similar to the reversible one shown by ferrocene under the same conditions. In the case of 1, a coupled chemical reaction was detected at slow scan rates after the oxidation. Transient species in the redox processes were investigated using flash photolysis and pulse radiolysis. In both cases, transient spectra of the products were similar to transient spectra observed for ferrocene. The decay kinetics of the oxidized and reduced transients were examined and mechanistic information was obtained. The experimental results show the potential uses of the two complexes as catalytic materials for electrochemical applications.

While the underlying mechanism of general and mechanically-assisted corrosion (MAC) related to orthopedic implants have been well-documented and extensive research have been focused on how metal ions and wear particles affect biological response, recent reports of inflammatory cell-induced corrosion (ICIC) on CoCrMo implants have challenged traditional one-way arrow understanding of the relationship between biological system and corrosion, which is 'corrosion causes biological responses', proposing a new concept: biology induces corrosion. This article provides a brief overview on in vivo corrosion of CoCrMo hip implants while focusing on ICIC and new perspective of the two-way feedback loop between corrosion and human body. Recent retrieval studies on ICIC and its clinical relevance will be presented. Biological elements, reactive chemical species and electrochemistry related to the underlying mechanism of ICIC will be discussed.

Experimental data are suggestive of a rather poor ability of the quasiaromatic polyazomethine clathrochelate framework to facilitate an intramolecular long-distance electron transfer. Experimental observations were correlated with the theoretical results obtained by Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Time-Dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations.

In contrast, p-nitro- and p-cyanobenzene diazonium salts dissolved in mixed aqueous-acetonitrile solvents showed diffusion-limited, quasi-reversible, two-electron cyclic voltammetry. Voltammetric pH-dependence and spectrophotometric kinetic studies suggest that the basicity and low polarity of the aqueous solvent mixture has revealed the biologically-significant interconversion of diazohydroxide and diazene.

X-ray structural analysis on single crystals of dpkaah (2) and 3-5 confirmed their identities and revealed pseudo-coordination of the carbonyl group (C=O). Infrared measurements confirmed the pseudo-coordination of the carbonyl group to MCl2. The geometries of 3-5 vary, while 5 adopts a square pyramidal geometry, 4 has a structure halfway between square pyramidal and trigonal bipyramidal and 3 is less distorted from square pyramidal than 3. The extended structures of 3-5 exposed extensive networks of non-covalent interactions, and in the case of 4 chloride bridges of the type Cd(-Cl)(2)Cd were observed. Spectroscopic measurements in different solvents and variable temperature studies confirmed the stability of the keto form of 1 and 3-5. Spectrophotometric titrations of protophilic solutions (dmf or dmso) of 1 with MCl2 revealed facile coordination of MCl2 to 1 and disclosed low concentrations of MCl2 can be detected and determined using protophilic solutions of 1. Electrochemical measurements on dmf solutions divulged electrochemical decomposition of uncoordinated 1, the facile coordination of 1 to MCl2, and the stability of 3-5 decreases as the size of the metal ion increases.

However, it remains challenging to develop assembly strategies that lead to the construction of 2D nanomaterials with well-defined geometry and functional nanoarchitectures that are tailored to specific applications. Here we report a facile self-assembly method leading to the controlled synthesis of 2D transition metal oxide (TMO) nanosheets containing a high density of holes. We utilize graphene oxide sheets as a sacrificial template and Pluronic copolymers as surfactants. By using ZnFe2O4 (ZFO) nanoparticles as a model material, we demonstrate that by tuning the molecular weight of the Pluronic copolymers we can incorporate the ZFO particles and tune the size of the holes in the sheets. The resulting 213 ZFO nanosheets offer synergistic characteristics including increased electrochemically active surface areas, shortened ion diffusion paths, and strong inherent mechanical properties, leading to enhanced lithium-ion storage properties. Postcycling characterization confirms that the samples maintain structural integrity after electrochemical cycling. Our findings demonstrate that this template-assisted self-assembly method is a useful bottom-up route for controlled synthesis of 2D nanoarchitectures, and these holey 2D nanoarchitectures are promising for improving the electrochemical performance of next-generation lithium-ion batteries.

In this work, {Co-NO}(8) complexes are induced to convert from (Co-II)(+center dot)-NO center dot to Co-III-NO- by a core contraction of 0.06 angstrom in saddled cobalt(II) porphyrins. This intramolecular electron transfer mechanism indicates that nonplanarity of porphyrin is involved in driving conversion of the NO units from electrophilic NO center dot as a bent geometry to nucleophilic NO- as a linear geometry. This implies that distortion acts as a trigger in enzymes containing tetrapyrrole. The electronic behaviors of the Co-II ions and Co-NO moieties were confirmed by X-ray crystallography, EPR spectroscopy, theoretical calculation, UV-vis and LR. spectroscopy, and electrochemistry.

An unexpected electrochemical feature in one of the complexes indicated a possible electrochemical-chemical-electrochemical (ECE) process. Further investigation into the oxidation mechanism included the synthesis and isolation of cationic and dicationic analogues of the complex. Density functional theory calculations suggested that a solvent interaction facilitated the ECE mechanism, so a solvent adduct was also synthesized and isolated. Calculations of this series of compounds were used to investigate the stabilizing role of the ligands over various oxidation states. As the overall charge of the complex was varied from anion to dication, a relatively constant Ru metal center oxidation state was found over all four states probed. This result suggests the strong involvement of the coligands in the redox behavior of the complexes investigated.

The influence of simulated inflammatory (SI) conditions on the corrosion behavior of CoCrMo alloy was investigated. A range of SI solutions, based on phosphate buffered saline with H2O2, HCl, and Fe3+ additions, were investigated. Open circuit potential (OCP), corrosion currents and impedance of the oxide film surface were all significantly (p<0.05) affected by increases in H2O2 concentration and decrease of pH. OCP (vs. Ag/AgCl) increased from -0.250 V in PBS solution to 0.355 V and 0.650 V in 30 mM H2O2 at pH 7.4 and pH 1 PBS solution. Iron ions (0.1 mM) in PBS solutions with 10 mM H2O2 (Fenton chemistry) increased OCP to 0.6 V. I-corr increased from 0.2 mu A/cm(2) to 14 mu A/cm(2) in SI conditions. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed decreased in oxide resistance (R-ox, p<0.05) while capacitance (CPE) increased (p<0.05) in SI solutions, pH 7.4 (R-ox=5 x 10(3) cm(2), CPE=55 mu F/cm(2)) as well as in Fenton reagent solution (R-ox=3.2 x 10(4) cm(2), CPE=45 mu F/cm(2)) compared to PBS only (R-ox=5 x 10(5) cm(2), CPE=31 mu F/cm(2)). These results indicate the corrosion susceptibility of CoCrMo alloy can be significantly increased by SI solutions, increasing the oxidizing power and decreasing the passivity of the oxide film. Cell-released chemicals such as H2O2 and acid are able to facilitate the corrosion of CoCrMo alloy and demonstrate part of the mechanism of inflammatory cell induced corrosion.

To improve the mechanistic understanding of lithium-sulfur batteries, this study investigates chemical reactions between the Li2S cathode and more oxidized sulfur species, such as S-8 and polysulfides, during the electrochemical charge of the battery. By combining the electrochemistry with X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we show that chemical reactions and, in particular, the resulting accumulation of solution species in the electrolyte are essential to oxidize Li2S at a low overpotential. Additionally, by efficiently separating the anode and cathode compartments of a battery with a lithium ion-exchanged Nafion interlayer, we establish the adverse effect of the anode on the buildup of solution intermediates. In the absence of the interlayer, polysulfide intermediates can diffuse through the separator and react at the anode's surface, while the addition of the interlayer allows the intermediates to accumulate in the separator of the cathode compartment and facilitate the oxidation of Li2S.

Electrochemistry-Mechanics Coupling in Intercalation Electrodes	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							DIFFUSION-INDUCED DAMAGE; LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES; X-RAY TOMOGRAPHY; ENERGY-STORAGE; INDUCED STRESS; ACOUSTIC-EMISSION; CAPACITY FADE; NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; IMPEDANCE RESPONSE; MATHEMATICAL-MODEL	Diffusion induced stress, due to repeated intercalation/deintercalation of lithium during cycling, causes mechanical degradation in graphite active particles used as an anode in lithium-ion batteries. The microcracks formed in the active particles hinder diffusion of lithium. On the other hand, flow of electrolyte through the accessible microcracks in the active particles leads to additional electrochemically active surfaces and effectively reduces the diffusion length. In this work, stochastic modeling of electrochemistry-mechanics interaction is presented which introduces the influence of electrochemically active microcracks on electrochemical reactions. Enhanced electrochemically active surface area further results in the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which decreases the cell capacity due to the consumption of cyclable lithium. This stochastic model successfully predicts the formation of non-uniform and spanning cracks in active particles, which are typically observed in scanning electron micrographs. The impact of coupled electrochemical and mechanical interaction in graphite active particles on capacity fade is elucidated. (C) The Author(s) 2018. Published by ECS.

The Effect of Silver Ion Occupancy on Hollandite Lattice Structure	MRS ADVANCES			English	Article							OCTAHEDRAL MOLECULAR-SIEVES; MAGNETIC-PROPERTIES; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; CRYPTOMELANE; NANORODS; REFINEMENTS; SYMMETRY; IMPACT; OXIDES; OMS-2	The effect of tunnel cations on tunnel size in alpha-MnO2 structured (hollandite, cryptomelane) materials has long been of interest, as the tunnel size effects catalytic and transport properties. Previous research on the tunnel size has focused on potassium cryptomelane (KxMn8O16). This paper uses synthetic control of silver content in AgxMn8O16 to investigate the effect that tunnel silver occupancy has on the lattice parameters. Materials with silver (x) content between 1.14 and 1.66 were synthesized, synchrotron diffraction and Rietveld Refinement was used to determine lattice parameters. The lattice parameters were found to contract as silver content increases (from 9.774 angstrom to 9.738 angstrom), in contrast to previous investigations of other tunnel cations.

In this work, we report an electrochemical strategy to controllably intercalate lithium ions into a series of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures built by sandwiching graphene between hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). We demonstrate that encapsulating graphene with h-BN eliminates parasitic surface side reactions while simultaneously creating a new heterointerface that permits intercalation between the atomically thin layers. To monitor the electrochemical process, we employ the Hall effect to precisely monitor the intercalation reaction. We also simultaneously probe the spectroscopic and electrical transport properties of the resulting intercalation compounds at different stages of intercalation. We achieve the highest carrier density >5 X 10(13) cm(2) with mobility >10(3) cm(2)/(V s) in the most heavily intercalated samples, where Shubnikov de Haas quantum oscillations are observed at low temperatures. These results set the stage for further studies that employ intercalation in modifying properties of vdW heterostructures.	[Zhao, S. Y. Frank; Bediako, D.

In this work, we successfully establish an effective experimental protocol to quantify the intrinsic performance of OER catalysts in a standard thinfilm rotating-(ring)-disk-electrode system. Furthermore, a new insight into the electric double layer (EDL) microstructure is gained to illustrate all experimental observations in alkaline media. The results indicate that IrO2 has 2.6-times higher activity than NiCo2O4, due to the improved reaction kinetics, charge transfer and O-2-transport occurring in the EDL. However, after 10 000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV), NiCo2O4 shows much higher stability due to continuous EDL structural modifications. In particular, it is revealed that the EDL charging process, accompanied by the electrocatalytic OER, has a strong effect on catalyst-electrolyte interfacial behaviors, which, in turn, determine the accuracy of electrochemical measurement results. It is further found that the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) obtained from traditional CV measured capacitance cannot accurately reflect the actual reaction sites of various catalysts during the OER. This discrepancy exists mainly because of the EDL capacitance, which is referred to as the inner capacitance caused by less accessible active sites. Alternatively, a novel method based on in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy has demonstrated improved accuracy in obtaining potential-dependent ECSAs, comparable to ex situ Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area measurements.

Investigating a Bromide Supported Electrolyte for an All-Copper Flow Battery	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							CHLORIDE COMPLEXES; AQUEOUS-SOLUTION; REDOX; CELL; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; PERFORMANCE; SOLUBILITY; ANIONS	This work investigates a bromide supported electrolyte for use in an all-copper flow battery (CuFB). In this battery, halide ions stabilize the cuprous ion. During charge, the cuprous halide complex is reduced to copper metal at the negative electrode and the complex is oxidized to a cupric halide complex at the positive electrode. Our measurements indicated that the CuFB utilizing a bromide electrolyte can achieve a higher open circuit potential (OCP) as compared to using a chloride electrolyte. The CuFB has negligible hydrogen and bromine evolution indicating that high coulombic efficiencies are achievable. A bromide supported all-CuFB with graphitic porous felt electrodes was demonstrated and the OCP after the initial charge was observed to be 0.81 V. The cell was cycled with a geometric current density of 150 mA cm(-2) for 50 cycles with state of charge swings of 0 to 60%, and had a voltaic efficiency (Sigma(j)(i=1) V-discharge/j/Sigma(k)(i=1) V-charge/k) of 64%, however, copper electrodeposits were nodular and non-adherent to the substrate. We conclude that further understanding of plating morphology and the effect of substrates are necessary to take advantage of this chemistry in a conventional hybrid battery configuration, and that this system could benefit from a slurry electrode.

The CMEA was embedded in a 7050 panel in combination with a sintered Ag/AgCl electrode which functioned as both the reference and counter electrode. This coupled multi-electrode array enabled net cathodic and anodic reaction kinetics to be monitored as a function of position, time, and electrolyte shape. Cathodic kinetics increased under thin films and droplets of electrolyte relative to full immersion. Under droplet conditions, electrodes at the droplet edge experienced an increase in oxygen reduction compared to the center of the droplet. Lastly, a dissimilar metal galvanic couple CMEA enabled an understanding of galvanic corrosion rates under atmospheric conditions. For the first time, anodes switching to cathodes due to copper replating was observed in real time. (C) 2018 The Electrochemical Society.

Electro-Kinetic Study of Oxygen Reduction Reaction Catalyzed by Thermophilic Laccase	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							FREE PLATINUM-ELECTRODES; BLUE COPPER OXIDASE; ELECTROCATALYTIC ACTIVITY; BIOFUEL CELLS; O-2 REDUCTION; CARBON; MECHANISM; SUPPORTS; ENZYMES	This article reports the electrochemical studies of bio-electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction catalyzed by a new laccase from a thermophilic bacterium, which exhibits superior stability and activity retention compared to fungal laccases. The electro-kinetic study of this catalytic reaction was conducted using a classic tool of electrochemistry, the rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE). Bacillus sp. FNT laccase was immobilized onto a multiwall carbon nanotube modified glassy carbon disk electrode using a molecular tethering agent, 1-pyrenebutanoic acid succinimidyl ester (PBSE). The conditions for laccase immobilization were optimized to prepare a highly active bioconjugate for the electrochemical reduction of oxygen. The kinetic parameters such as Tafel slopes, number of electrons transferred, electrochemical rate constant and the electron transfer rate were calculated from RRDE measurements. The rate constant of the four-electron transfer reaction was calculated to be 3.21 x 10(-1) +/- 8.5 x 10(-3) cm s(-1). The slope value obtained from Tafel plot was close to that of value for the ideal four-electron transfer oxygen reduction, suggesting excellent electro-catalytic activity of the FNT laccase-MWCNT conjugates.

Junior High School Pre-service Science Teachers' Familiarity, Conceptual Understanding and Interest in Electrochemistry	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION			English	Article						Electrochemistry; familiarity; interest; understanding; pre-service teacher	STUDENTS; ATTITUDES; CHEMISTRY	This study in Zambia examined 66 junior high school pre-service science teachers' familiarity with, conceptual understanding of and levels of interest in learning more about electrochemistry concepts. Data were collected using the Familiarity with Electrochemistry Questionnaire, the Conceptual Understanding of Electrochemistry Test and the Interest in Electrochemistry Questionnaire. Statistical tests were used to analyse data. Pre-service teachers reported high levels of familiarity with the electrochemistry concepts surveyed. They were more familiar with basic than advanced electrochemistry concepts. On average, participants demonstrated moderate conceptual understanding of electrochemistry concepts. Although there was a significant difference between males' and females' familiarity with electrochemistry concepts, there was no significant difference between the two gender groups in their understanding of and interest in electrochemistry. There were no significant correlations between participants' familiarity with, understanding of and interest in electrochemistry. Overall, pre-service science teachers' self-reported high levels of familiarity with electrochemistry concepts was at variance with their actual conceptual understanding of the concepts. However, pre-service science teachers expressed high levels of interest in learning more about electrochemistry concepts they did not understand. In particular, pre-service teachers were interested in learning more about advanced electrochemistry concepts. The implications for teacher education and chemistry teaching and learning are discussed.

This research reveals that microbial communities are more diverse and complex than ever imagined. New and specialized instrumentation is required to investigate, with high spatial and temporal resolution, the dynamic biochemical environment that is created by microbes, which allows them to exist in every corner of the Earth. This review describes how electrochemical probes and techniques are being used and optimized to learn about microbial communities. Described approaches include voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, scanning electrochemical microscopy, separation techniques coupled with electrochemical detection, and arrays of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor circuits. Microbial communities also interact with and influence their surroundings; therefore, the review also includes a discussion of how electrochemical probes optimized for microbial analysis are utilized in healthcare diagnostics and environmental monitoring applications.

New fabrication methods have allowed the gap between the two working electrodes to be reduced to 10's of nanometers in size.

Structural Studies of Capacity Activation and Reduced Voltage Fading in Li-Rich, Mn-Ni-Fe Composite Oxide Cathode	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES; X-RAY-DIFFRACTION; POSITIVE-ELECTRODE MATERIALS; LAYERED OXIDE; SPINEL PHASE; OXYGEN LOSS; TRANSFORMATION; ABSORPTION; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; PERFORMANCE	Li-rich Mn-Ni-Fe (MNF) oxide cathodes are emerging as a low-cost alternative to commercial Ni-Mn-Co (NMC) oxides with the cost of raw iron being three orders of magnitude lower than cobalt. MNF cathodes have demonstrated potential for high capacity and high discharge voltage cathodes, however, the capacity decay and instability of discharge voltage upon cycling still need to be resolved for their successful commercialization. Both phenomena are related to the changes in structure and in this study, we utilize SXRD and XAFS to investigate the structural changes correlated to electrochemical performance of Li1.2Mn0.5Ni0.2Fe0.1O2 cathode. This material, prepared by sol gel synthesis, showed initial discharge capacity of 226 mAhg(-1) and 93% capacity retention after 100 cycles. Fitting of the XAFS results provided information on the changes in local environment of each transition metal atom. Such detailed information on atomic environment is reported for the first time and compared to prior studies of NMC cathodes. In the discharged state Mn atoms show a shift to lower oxidation state and an irreversible loss of oxygen near neighbors after cycling, while Ni and Fe show only minor changes in their environment. An observed 5.87% lattice expansion after cycling is suggested to contribute to voltage fade. (C) The Author(s) 2018. Published by ECS.

Effects of polishing conditions such as applied loads and rotating speeds on frictional behavior and potentiodynamic polarization were studied. Results showed that the friction coefficient decreased slightly with the increase in applied load and polishing speed indicating the boundary lubrication regime during cobalt ECMP. The corrosion current declined firstly and then increased with the increase in mechanical power input. Further analysis revealed that the cobalt surface electrochemistry was interrelated to mechanical impact and corrosive environment, and it is not simply a linear relationship. The synergy of mechanically induced material removal and oxidation in the polishing process depends on the mechanical power and electrochemical reaction. This finding is beneficial to uncovering the mechanism of cobalt ECMP and guiding the process optimization. (C) 2018 The Electrochemical Society.

The typical inverse relationship between power and energy in batteries is often due to the slow ion diffusion in electrode materials. While the optimization of current battery technology may be sufficient to fully address this issue, we present here that novel chemistry-focused strategies based on new fundamental understanding of materials may be applied to lead to the development of a new generation of batteries that store energy sufficiently and deliver it rapidly.

In this work, GQDs are synthesized by solvothermal and hydrothermal techniques, with optimal size of 5 nm. Their potential in fundamental (direct electron transfer) and applied (enzymatic glucose biosensor) electrochemistry are demonstrated. Glucose oxidase (GO(x)) immobilized on glassy carbon (GC) electrodes modified with GQDs are investigated by means of cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry, and amperometry. Well-defined quasi-reversible redox peaks observed under various electrochemical parameters helped to determine diffusion coefficient (D) and first-order electron transfer rate (kET). The cyclic voltammetry curves showed homogeneous ion transport for GQD with D ranging between 8.45 x 10(-9) m(2) s(-1) and 3 x 10(-8) m(2) s(-1) following GO < rGO < GQD < GQD (with FcMeOH as redox probe) < GOx/rGO < GOx/GO < HRP/GQDs < GOx/GQDs. The developed GO(x)-GQDs biosensor responds efficiently and linearly to the presence of glucose over concentrations ranging 10 mu M and 3 mM with limit of detection 1.35 mu M and sensitivity 0.00769 mu A mu M-1 center dot cm(-2) as compared with rGO (0.025 mu A mu M-1 cm(-2), 4.16 mu M) and GO (0.064 mu A mu M-1 cm(-2), 4.82 mu M) nanosheets. The high performance and stability of GQDs is attributed to sufficiently large surface-to-volume ratio, excellent biocompatibility, abundant hydrophilic edge site density, and partially hydrophobic planar sites that favors GO(x) adsorption on the electrode surface and versatile architectures to ensure rapid charge transfer and electron/ion conduction (<10 ms). We also carried out similar studies with other enzymatic protein biomolecules on electrode surfaces prepared from GQD precursors for electrochemical comparison, thus opening up potential sensing applications in medicine as well as bio-nanotechnology.

Review of the Stability/Capacity Trade-off in Silver Hollandite Lithium Battery Cathodes	MRS ADVANCES			English	Review							ELECTROCHEMISTRY; ALPHA-MNO2; OXIDES	Highly detailed structural characterization is required to understand the discharge mechanism in order to effectively investigate alpha-MnO2 structured lithium battery cathode materials. This paper discusses recent findings which elucidate the lithiation mechanism of silver-hollandite, AgxMn8O16. For Ag1.2Mn8O16, the structure is not significantly perturbed during the first 2 equivalents of lithiation and the electrochemistry is highly reversible. Upon 4 equivalents of lithiation, the structure becomes highly distorted, in correlation with capacity fade observed over 40 cycles. Notably, regarding capacity fade, modifications to Ag/Mn ratio are less impactful than modifications to the alpha-MnO2 crystallite size. This is shown in comparisons of two materials with the same stoichiometry (Ag1.4Mn8O16) and differing crystallite size (10 and 15 nm).

Surface Electrolyte Interphase Control on Magnetite, Fe3O4, Electrodes: Impact on Electrochemistry	MRS ADVANCES			English	Article							LITHIUM ION BATTERIES; PERFORMANCE; TRANSPORT; CARBONATE; SYSTEMS; ANODES	In battery systems, a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is formed through electrolyte reaction on an electrode surface. The formation of SEI can have both positive and negative effects on electrochemistry. The initial formation of the layer protects the electrode from further reactivity, which can improve both shelf and cycle life. However, if the layer continues to form, it can impede charge transfer, which increases cell resistance and limits cycle life. The role of SEI is particularly important when studying conversion electrodes, since phase transformations which unveil new electroactive surfaces during reduction/oxidation can facilitate electrolyte decomposition. This manuscript highlights recent developments in the understanding and control of SEI formation for magnetite (Fe3O4) conversion electrodes through electrolyte and electrode modification.

Voltage and wear debris from Ti-6Al-4V interact to affect cell viability during in-vitro fretting corrosion	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A			English	Article						In-vitro fretting corrosion; cell-biomaterial interaction; orthopedic alloys; wear and corrosion; electrochemistry effects on cells	TITANIUM; SURFACES; REDUCTION; TI6AL4V; METAL	Fretting corrosion (or mechanically assisted corrosion, MAC) is a major corrosion mechanism in modular orthopedic implants. There is a complex interplay between fretting corrosion and the surrounding biological environment that includes particle generation and electrochemical potential excursions and currents. The goal of this work is to directly investigate the effects of fretting on cells in vitro. Using an in vitro fretting device, MC3T3 preosteoblasts were cultured onto Ti-6Al-4V disks adjacent to the fretting site. Under fretting corrosion conditions, cell viability dramatically decreased to 0.5% with the voltage drop reaching 21 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Under the same fretting corrosion conditions, but potentiostatically holding the Ti-6Al-4V sample surface potential to 2300 mV or 250 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl), the cell viability increases to 70% and 38%, respectively. The results indicate that both cathodic potential excursions and wear debris play significant roles in affecting cell viability. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Redox, spectroscopic, photo-induced ligand exchange, and DNA interaction studies of a new Ru(II) Pt(II) bimetallic complex	JOURNAL OF COORDINATION CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Ruthenium; DNA covalent binding; Photo-induced ligand exchange; redox properties; cisplatin	RUTHENIUM(II) POLYPYRIDINE COMPLEXES; TERPYRIDINE COMPLEXES; METAL-COMPLEXES; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; BINDING; LIGHT; PHOTOPHYSICS; PHOTOCLEAVAGE; ANTICANCER	A new bimetallic complex, [Ru(biq)(2) (dpp) PtCl2](PF6)(2) (where biq = 2,2'-biquinoline and dpp = 2,3-bis(2-pyridyl) pyrazine), containing a cis-PtCl2 moiety coupled to a sterically strained Ru(II)based chromophore was designed, synthesized, and investigated with respect to its spectroscopic, redox, photo-induced ligand exchange, and DNA-interaction properties. The electrochemistry of the designed complex was found to be consistent with the bridging coordination of the dpp ligand and formation of the bimetallic complex. The complex displays intense ligand-based pi -> pi transitions in the UV region and metal-to-ligand charge-transfer transitions (MLCT) in the visible region. The loss of bridging coordination of the dpp ligand and formation of complexes, [Ru(biq)(2)(CH3CN)(2)](2+) and [Pt(dpp) (CH3CN) (2)](2+) was observed when an acetonitrile solution of the metal complex was irradiated with visible light (lambda(irr) = 550 nm). The designed complex displays covalent binding with DNA in dark through the cis-PtCl 2 moiety, as confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Upon photoirradiation, the complex dissociates into two DNA-binding moieties and displays covalent binding through: (i) a cis-PtL2 subunit of [Ptdpp(L)(2)](2+) and (ii) open coordination sites of the ruthenium of [Ru(biq)(2) (L)(2)](2+) (L = solvent). The designed complex represents the first Ru(II) Pt(II) complex that undergoes photo-induced ligand exchange and displays multifunctional interactions with DNA upon photoirradiation.

Total Internal Reflection Absorption Spectroscopy (TIRAS) for the Detection of Solvated Electrons at a Plasma-liquid Interface	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS			English	Article						Chemistry; Issue 131; solvated electron; absorption spectroscopy; non-thermal plasma; plasma electrochemistry; glow discharge electrolysis; plasma-liquid	ATMOSPHERIC-PRESSURE; HYDRATED ELECTRON; WATER; SPECTRUM	The total internal reflection absorption spectroscopy (TIRAS) method presented in this article uses an inexpensive diode laser to detect solvated electrons produced by a low-temperature plasma in contact with an aqueous solution. Solvated electrons are powerful reducing agents, and it has been postulated that they play an important role in the interfacial chemistry between a gaseous plasma or discharge and a conductive liquid. However, due to the high local concentrations of reactive species at the interface, they have a short average lifetime (similar to 1 mu s), which makes them extremely difficult to detect. The TIRAS technique uses a unique total internal reflection geometry combined with amplitude-modulated lock-in amplification to distinguish solvated electrons' absorbance signal from other spurious noise sources. This enables the in situ detection of shortlived intermediates in the interfacial region, as opposed to the bulk measurement of stable products in the solution. This approach is especially attractive for the field of plasma electrochemistry, where much of the important chemistry is driven by short-lived free radicals. This experimental method has been used to analyze the reduction of nitrite (NO2(aq)-), nitrate (NO3(aq)-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2(aq)), and dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2(aq)) by plasma-solvated electrons and deduce effective rate constants. Limitations of the method may arise in the presence of unintended parallel reactions, such as air contamination in the plasma, and absorbance measurements may also be hindered by the precipitation of reduced electrochemical products. Overall, the TIRAS method can be a powerful tool for studying the plasma-liquid interface, but its effectiveness depends on the particular system and reaction chemistry under study.

Operando Spectromicroscopy of Sulfur Species in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Li-SM3 Conference	APR 26-27, 2017	London, ENGLAND				LI-S BATTERY; X-RAY-DIFFRACTION; IN-SITU; LIQUID ELECTROLYTE; DISCHARGE PRODUCTS; POLYSULFIDES; SPECTROSCOPY; MECHANISM; SHUTTLE; ADSORPTION	In this study, a novel cross-sectional battery cell was developed to characterize lithium-sulfur batteries using X-ray spectromicroscopy. Chemically sensitive X-raymaps were collected operando at energies relevant to the expected sulfur species and were used to correlate changes in sulfur species with electrochemistry. Significant changes in the sulfur/carbon composite electrode were observed from cycle to cycle including rearrangement of the elemental sulfur matrix and PEO10LiTFSI binder. Polysulfide concentration and area of spatial diffusion increased with cycling, indicating that some polysulfide dissolution is irreversible, leading to polysulfide shuttle. Fitting of the maps using standard sulfur and polysulfide XANES spectra indicated that upon subsequent discharge/charge cycles, the initial sulfur concentration was not fully recovered; polysulfides and lithium sulfide remained at the cathodes with higher order polysulfides as the primary species in the region of interest. Quantification of the polysulfide concentration across the electrolyte and electrode interfaces shows that the polysulfide concentration before the first discharge and after the third charge is constant within the electrolyte, but while cycling, a significant increase in polysulfides and a gradient toward the lithium metal anode forms. This chemically and spatially sensitive characterization and analysis provides a foundation for further operando spectromicroscopy of lithium-sulfur batteries. (C) The Author(s) 2017.

The two options are bio-oil thermochemical upgrading to drop-in transportation biofuels through hydrotreating and hydrocracking, and bio-oil electrochemical conversion for electrical power generation using a direct bio-oil fuel cell method. The technoeconomic performances of biomass-to-biofuels and biomass-to-electricity pathways are first examined individually, and then integrated for the analysis of a hybrid biomass conversion system. A biomass facility of 2000 tonnes per day is investigated as a baseline. The minimum fuel-selling price (MFSP) is estimated to be $2.48 per gallon, with biomass feedstock and other operating costs as major contributors. A very high minimum electricity-selling price (MESP) of $5.36 per kWh is projected based on the current laboratory-scale fuel cell configuration. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the effective reactant content in bio-oil, the degree of oxidation, and the fuel cell system efficiency play key roles in the MESP. The estimate can be reduced to $0.96 per kWh if target values of the three parameters are met. The results of the hybrid system suggest that the MESP can be reduced substantially from $0.96 to $0 per kWh when the hybrid system increases the bio-oil fraction for biofuel production from 0 to 75.8%, given a biofuel MFSP of $3 per gallon.

Sodium-Ion Battery Anodes Comprising Carbon Sheets: Stable Cycling in Half- and Full-Pouch Cell Configuration	ENERGY TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						carbon sheets; electrochemistry; energy storage; impedance spectroscopy; sodium-ion batteries	NEGATIVE ELECTRODE; LITHIUM; INSERTION; IMPEDANCE; NANOWIRES; LIFE	In this work, carbon sheets derived from starch packing peanuts were evaluated for their viability as sodium-ion anodes in both half-cell and full-pouch cell configurations. The carbon sheets are approximate to 1 mu m thick and 5-50 mm wide in dimensions with hard carbon structuring. The carbon sheets have a surface area of 430 m(2)g(-1) with 92.5% micropores (< 2 nm) and 7.5% mesopores (2-6 nm). Moreover, the carbon sheets contain a native Na2CO3 layer on the surface that could act as stable artificial solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI). The carbon sheet anode delivers 153 mAhg(-1) of reversible capacity at 50 mAg(-1) and 55 mAhg(-1) at 1000 mAg(-1) with good cycling stability (92% capacity retention) after 150 cycles. Post-diagnostic analysis of the cycled carbon sheet electrode reveals that sheet-like morphology of the carbon remains preserved after one hundred discharging-charging cycles and no excessive SEI formation is observed. The carbon sheet anodes, when paired with a Na(a)Ni(1-x-y-z)Mn(x)M1(y)M2(z)O(2) cathode (M1 and M2 are transition metals) by Faradion Limited (UK), exhibit an average discharge voltage of 3.15 V. Stable cycling is demonstrated in full-cells with 90% capacity retention after 200 cycles and 84% retention after 300 cycles in pouch cells. This excellent long-term cycling stability with an average coulombic efficiency of 99.8% is among the best reported for sodium-ion full-cells in the literature and is attributed to the material's stable SEI formation.

The Stokes-Einstein equation and the diffusion of ferrocene in imidazolium-based ionic liquids studied by cyclic voltammetry: Effects of cation ion symmetry and alkyl chain length	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Ionic liquids; Ferrocene; Diffusion coefficient; Cyclic voltammetry; Stokes-Einstein equation	SOLVENTS; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; ELECTROLYTES; ELECTRODES; MIXTURES; KINETICS; FUTURE	The diffusion of ferrocene (Fc) molecules in ionic liquids (ILs) was studied using cyclic voltammetry. The symmetric ILs 1,3-dialkylimidazolium bis[(trifluoromethane) sulfonyl] amide ([(C-N/2)(2)im][NTf2] with N = 4, 6, 8, and 10) and non-symmetric ILs 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium bis[(trifluoromethane) sulfonyl] amide ([C(N-1)C(1)im][NTf2] with N = 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10) were used to examine the effect of the symmetry of alkyl substitution on the cation and the role of alkyl chain length on the diffusion of Fc. The diffusion coefficient D of Fc was determined by applying the Randles-Sevcik equation to the peak current in the cyclic voltammograms. The diffusion coefficient was found to be higher in a symmetric IL than in a non-symmetric IL with the same number of alkyl carbon atoms N, with the difference decreasing with increasing N. The diffusion of Fc in these ILs is well described by the Stokes-Einstein equation with slip boundary conditions, but with an effective hydrodynamic radius of 0.23 +/- 0.01 nm, which is less than the 0.27 nm crystallographic radius of Fc, in agreement with previous studies of the diffusion of solutes in ILs that show the hydrodynamic radius to be less than the van der Waals radius of the solute.

A new triazine bearing a pyrazolone group capable of copper, nickel, and zinc chelation	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; GENERATION; DENDRIMERS; COMPLEXES; LIGANDS; BETA	Interest in inorganic applications of triazines is growing. In this report, metal complexes of copper(II), nickel(II), and zinc(II) and a novel class of chelates composed of a triazine ring substituted with a hydrazine group and pyrazolone are evaluated using spectrophotometric methods, single crystal X-ray diffractometry, and electrochemistry. Complexes with copper(II) include a single chelate and chloride ion(s)/water to satisfy a trigonal bipyramidal coordination sphere. The nickel(II) and zinc(II) complexes are composed of two chelating groups that adopt an octahedral geometry around the metal ion. Irreversible redox activity was observed with the copper(II) complex but no redox activity was observed with the ligand alone or zinc(II) and nickel(II) complexes. Use of the coumarin carboxylic acid assay shows that the ligand motif is capable of preventing redox cycling of copper in biological conditions and could thus serve as an antioxidant preventative agent. Cellular toxicity studies show that the new triazine molecule could have therapeutic applications in the mM concentration range based on the measured EC50 = 1.183 +/- 0.002 mM. Altogether this work shows that by merging triazine chemistry into inorganic compounds, there is potential to explore a range applications thanks to the new architecture.

In contrast, postsynthetic treatments occur after the synthesis of electrodes. Recently, such postsynthetic treatments based upon illumination, chemistry, electrochemistry, or combinations thereof have led to dramatic improvements in the performance and efficiency of BiVO4 photoanodes. This Perspective summarizes recent BiVO4 postsynthetic treatments with mechanistic details and highlights important future directions. One broad challenge is that multiple interpretations of defect changes may be consistent with routine X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data. Further experiments are suggested to better differentiate between the proposed defect changes. Also, performance changes are considered separately with respect to charge separation and charge injection efficiencies as well as within the context of known synthetic modifications. The emergence of postsynthetic treatments highlights new opportunities to understand and improve photoelectrodes. Similar mechanisms may be of further utility as researchers turn more focus toward the development of novel multinary metal oxide photoabsorbers for the production of solar fuels. Lastly, postsynthetic treatments also elucidate possible electrode changes under extended service and can provide new strategies to enable extended device performance.

Benzimidazole is a commonly used nitrogen heterocycle in U.S. FDA approved drugs; therefore, a direct and sustainable approach that limits chemical waste for the synthesis of substituted benzimidazoles is appealing. The electrosynthetic approach described within is able to synthesize a variety of 1H-substitubed benzimidazoles while concurrently producing H-2, without a transition-metal catalyst or added bases. Furthermore, the procedure works efficiently with only simple carbon electrodes, thus avoiding commonly employed platinum and gold electrodes. This electrochemical procedure also exhibited good functional group tolerance. Desired products were achieved with up to 88% yield, illustrating the range and possible sustainability of this approach.	[Dissanayake, D. M. M.

Multifunctional triphenylamine polymers synthesized via direct (hetero) arylation polymerization	JOURNAL OF POLYMER SCIENCE PART A-POLYMER CHEMISTRY			English	Article						direct (hetero) arylation polymerization; Electrochemistry; electrochromism; electroluminescence; optical and photovoltaic applications; synthesis and processing techniques; triphenylamine	LIGHT-EMITTING-DIODES; DIRECT (HETERO)ARYLATION; SOLAR-CELLS; BAND-GAP; COPOLYMERS; ELECTROCHROMISM; TRANSISTORS; TRANSPORT; MOBILITY; ROUTE	The design rules for creating multifunctional organic electronic materials are currently limited. By copolymerizing twisted triphenylamine (TPA) and electron rich dioxythiophene (XDOT) monomers via Direct (Hetero) Arylation Polymerization (DHAP), a set of polymers are obtained that perform as yellow to transmissive electrochromic (EC) films with up to 45% contrast, as well as in electroluminescent (EL) applications, achieving a luminance of approximate to 450 cd/m(2) in yellow-green polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs). In addition, polymerizing TPA with a donor-acceptor-donor monomer results in a low-bandgap polymer that achieves power conversion efficiencies up to 2.5% when blended with PC71BM in conventional organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. Incorporation of TPA units into the polymer backbone largely breaks any aggregation and ordering in the solid-state, leading to highly soluble materials that form smooth, reproducible thin films. The TPA unit also serves to break conjugation throughout the polymer backbone, providing precise control over optical and electronic properties through choice of comonomer. These results suggest that TPA copolymers can be useful for achieving multi-functionality without sacrificing facile solution processability, making them promising candidates for multifunctional devices like dual EC/EL displays.

Improving microstructural quantification in FIB/SEM nanotomography	ULTRAMICROSCOPY			English	Article						Focused ion beam; Scanning electron microscopy; 3D reconstruction; Microstructure quantification; Triple phase boundaries; Tortuosity	FOCUSED ION-BEAM; 3-DIMENSIONAL RECONSTRUCTION; ANODES; TEMPERATURE; TORTUOSITY; ELECTRODES; ALGORITHM; SHAPE	FIB/SEM nanotomography (FIB-nt) is a powerful technique for the determination and quantification of the three-dimensional microstructure in subsurface features. Often times, the microstructure of a sample is the ultimate determiner of the overall performance of a system, and a detailed understanding of its properties is crucial in advancing the materials engineering of a resulting device. While the FIB-nt technique has developed significantly in the 15 years since its introduction, advanced nanotomographic analysis is still far from routine, and a number of challenges remain in data acquisition and post-processing. In this work, we present a number of techniques to improve the quality of the acquired data, together with easy-to-implement methods to obtain "advanced" microstructural quantifications. The techniques are applied to a solid oxide fuel cell cathode of interest to the electrochemistry community, but the methodologies are easily adaptable to a wide range of material systems. Finally, results from an analyzed sample are presented as a practical example of how these techniques can be implemented. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, single characterization techniques are usually limited in detecting the ionic dynamics at the full range of environmental conditions. In this report, we probe and uncover the links between the microstructure of nanostructured ceria (NC) and parameters that govern its electrochemical reaction and proton transport, by coupling experimental data obtained with time-resolved Kelvin probe force microscopy (tr-KPFM), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and finite element analysis. It is found that surface morphology determines the water splitting rate and proton conductivity at 25 degrees C and wet conditions, when protons are mainly generated and transported within surface physisorbed water layers. However, at higher temperature (i.e., >= 125 degrees C) and dry conditions, when physisorbed water evaporates, grain size, and crystallographic orientation become significant factors. Specifically, the proton generation rate is negatively correlated with the grain size, whereas proton diffusivity is facilitated by surface {111} planes and additional conduction pathways offered by cracks and open pores connected to the surface.

Local degradation pathways in lithium-rich manganese-nickel-cobalt oxide epitaxial thin films	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article							X-RAY-DIFFRACTION; ELECTRODE MATERIALS; CYCLING PERFORMANCE; CATHODE MATERIALS; POTENTIAL STEP; VOLTAGE-FADE; ION; BATTERIES; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; TRANSITION	The electrochemical performance and microstructure of positive electrodes are intimately linked. As such, developing batteries resistance to capacity and voltage fade requires understanding these underlying structure-property relationships and their evolution with operation. Epitaxial films of a Li-rich manganese-nickel-cobalt oxide cathode material were deposited on (100)- and (111)-oriented SrRuO3/SrTiO3 substrates. Cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy tracked the response of these positive electrode materials, while the microstructure of the pristine and cycled films was characterized using transmission electron microscopy. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy identifies compositional fluctuations in as-deposited films. Phase transformations and dissolution were observed after electrochemical testing. There is a correlation between both local composition and substrate orientation (i.e., surface faceting) and what degradation pathways are active. Regions with comparatively higher concentrations of Ni and Co were more resistant to dissolution and unfavorable phase transformations than those with relatively more Mn. As such, a global composition metric may not be an accurate predictor of degradation and performance. Rather possessing the synthetic ability to engineer the chemical profile as well as characterizing it, pose a challenge and opportunity.	[Johnston-Peck, Aaron C.; Takeuchi, Saya; Bharathi, K.
