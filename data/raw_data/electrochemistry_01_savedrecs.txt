It is of great importance to design and synthesize micro/nanostructured Si and Ge materials. In this work, we demonstrated that Si, Ge and SiGe micro/nanowires can be continuously synthesized from their oxides precursors through molten salt electrodeposition. The electrochemical synthesis processes have been investigated systematically, and the deposited Si, Ge and SiGe micro/nanowires have been characterized and compared. The results show that the micro/nanostructured Si and Ge materials with tunable morphology can be facilely and continuously produced via molten salt electrodeposition. The electrodeposition process generally includes calcium oxide-assisted dissolution and electrodeposition processes, and the morphologies of the deposited Si and Ge products can be controlled by varying conditions. Si micro/nanowires, Si films, Ge micro/nanowires, and Ge particles can be continuously synthesized in a controlled manner.

Facile Synthesis of Bio-Templated Tubular Co3O4 Microstructure and Its Electrochemical Performance in Aqueous Electrolytes	JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Biotemplated; Co3O4; Electrochemistry; Supercapacitance; Specific Capacitance	ENERGY-STORAGE; HYDROTHERMAL SYNTHESIS; PORE-SIZE; ACTIVATED CARBON; TIO2 ANATASE; SUPERCAPACITOR; COBALT; ELECTRODES; CAPACITANCE; COMPOSITES	Template-assisted facile synthesis of tubular Co3O4 microstructures and its electrochemical performance was studied to understand its use as a potential electrode material for supercapacitors. Tubular porous Co3O4 microstructures were synthesized using cotton fibers as bio-template. The as-obtained templated Co3O4 structure inherits the morphology and microstructure of cotton fiber. The electrochemical performance of the electrode made up of tubular Co3O4 structure was evaluated in 3 M KOH, NaOH, and LiOH aqueous electrolytes. The large-surface-area of tubular Co3O4 microstructure has a noticeable pseudocapacitive performance with a capacitance of 401 F/g at 1 A/g and 828 F/g at 2 mV/s, a Coulombic efficiency averaging similar to 100%, and excellent cycling stability with capacitance retention of about 80% after 5,000 cycles. Overall, the tubular Co3O4 microstructure displayed superior electrochemical performance in 3 M KOH electrolyte with peak power density reaching 5,500 W/kg and energy density exceeding 22 Wh/kg. The superior performance of tubular Co3O4 microstructure electrode is attributed to its high surface area and adequate pore volume distribution, which allows effective redox reaction and diffusion of hydrated ions. The facile synthesis method can be adapted for preparing various metal oxide microstructures for possible applications in catalysis, electrochemical, sensors, and fuel cells applications.

Transformation of tetrachloroethylene in a flow-through electrochemical reactor	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Chlorinated ethenes; Removal; Groundwater; Electrochemistry; Design screening	PD-CATALYTIC HYDRODECHLORINATION; REDUCTIVE DECHLORINATION; CHLORINATED SOLVENTS; CIS-DICHLOROETHENE; ACTIVATED CARBON; AQUEOUS-SOLUTION; TRICHLOROETHYLENE; DEGRADATION; TCE; IRON	Electrochemical transformation of harmful tetrachloroethylene (PCE) is evaluated as a method for management of groundwater plumes to protect the drinking water resource, its consumers and the environment. In contrast to previous work that reported transformation of trichloroethylene, a byproduct of PCE, this work focuses on transformation of PCE in a saturated porous matrix and the influence of design parameters on the removal performance. Design parameters investigated were electrode configuration, catalyst load, electrode spacing, current intensity, orientation of reactor and flow through a porous matrix. A removal of 86% was reached in the fully liquid-filled, horizontally oriented reactor at a current of 120 mA across a cathode -> bipolar electrode -> anode arrangement with a Darcy velocity of 0.03 cm/min (150 m/yr). The palladium load on the cathode significantly influenced the removal. Enhanced removal was observed with increased electrode spacing. Presence of an inert porous matrix improved PCE removal by 9%-point compared to a completely liquid-filled reactor. Normalization of the data indicated, that a higher charge transfer per contaminant mass is required for removal of low PCE concentrations. No chlorinated intermediates were formed. The results suggest, that PCE can be electrochemically transformed in reactor designs replicating that of a potential field-implementation. Further work is required to better understand the reduction and oxidation processes established and the parameters influencing such. This knowledge is essential for optimization towards testing in complex conditions and variations of contaminated sites. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Herein, TinO2n-1(n = 2-6, 8 and 9) particles with core-shell nanostructure were rapid-prepared by an extraordinary carbothermal reduction process of P25 powders using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) reductant. The products synthesized at different temperatures were investigated by XRD, TEM, XPS, TG-DSC and UV-Vis. The results showed that carbon-coated TinO2n-1 powders were obtained within a few seconds in argon atmosphere, while the resistivity and BET surface area of TinO2n-1@C are 0.02-0.206 Omega cm and 4.62-14.6 m(2) g(-)(l), respectively. Notably, the carbon shell thickness varied from 2 nm to 11 nm and the average particle size of the Magneli phase core ranged from 30 nm to 100 nm with an increase in reduction temperature. The residual carbon in the typical Magneli phases of Ti5O9 and Ti4O7 was between 4.92 wt% to 5.91 wt%. In addition, the UV-visible absorptivity showed that samples had favourable optical absorption properties in the visible range. This work is expected to be helpful in developing a rapid, simple and practical approach to fabricate different core-shell TinO2n-1 powders. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Urea was purposely introduced as an additional nitrogen source as well as porogen. The diverse carbons were obtained by thermal treatment of the physical mixtures under N-2 atmosphere in one-step. Physicochemical characterization of the resultant carbons demonstrated that the presence of urea plays a key role in the formation of abundant micropores. With the incorporation of urea into the DES-templated system, the pore structure dominated by small mesopores evolved to a desirable micro-mesoporous hierarchical texture and exhibited a broccoli-like morphology. It has been demonstrated that the broccoli-like carbons exhibit enhanced electrochemical performance when used as electrodes in supercapacitors ascribed to the synergistic effect between rational micro-mesoporous structure and excellent nitrogen-doping efficiency (ca. 4-10 wt%).

However, most layered cathodes with oxygen redox might suffer from irreversible electrochemical reaction, fast capacity decay and underlying O-2 release. Herein, we report that copper element with a strong electronegativaty can stablize Na-deficient P-2-Na2/3Mn0.72Cu0.22Mg0.06O2 phase to achieve both cationic and anionic redox chemistry. Hard and soft X-ray absorption spectra demonstrate that all Mn3+/Mn4+, Cu2+/Cu3+ and O2-/(O-2)(n-) participate in the redox reaction upon Na+ ions extraction and insertion. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the strong covalency between copper and oxygen ensures the cationic and anionic redox activity in P-2-Na2/3Mn0.72Cu0.22Mg0.06O2 phase. The P-2-Na2/3Mn0.72Cu0.22Mg0.06O2 cathode could deliver stable cycling life with 87.9% capacity retention at 1C during 100 cycles, as well as high rate performance (70.3 mA h g(-1) cycled at 10C). Our findings not only provide a promising guidelines to enhance the electrochemical performance of layered oxides based on anionic redox activity, but also explore the potential science behind oxygen redox process.

Measurements performed at various rotation rates afforded unambiguous evidence that maximum yields for O-2(-)(aq) is attained at potentials associated with a current minimum in the polarization curve at E-disk = 0.3 V vs RHE, with a ca. 18% faradaic efficiency. In stark contrast, no O-2(-)(aq) could be detected in virtually identical experiments involving Au and Pt disk electrodes. This finding indicates that, if superoxide is involved in the mechanism of O-2 (aq) reduction on these metals, it remains adsorbed on the surface and is subsequently reduced, or, if desorbed, the rate of its reduction would be high enough for its concentration to decrease to undetectable levels at the functionalized Au-ring under the experimental conditions employed.

Recent emphasis on CNDs in the selective detection of metal ions is due to the growing concern for human and environmental safety. In this work, two types of fluorescent carbon nanodots (CNDs) are synthesized economically from ethylene diamine (E-CNDs) or urea (U-CNDs) in a single step microwave process. The as-prepared CNDs exhibit excellent PL at an excitation wavelength of 350 nm with a quantum yield of 64% for E-CNDs and 8.4% for U-CNDs with reference to quinine sulfate. Both E-CNDs and U-CNDs demonstrate high selectivity towards Fe (III) ions among different metal ions, by fluorescence quenching in a dose dependent manner. The limit of detection of E-CNDs and U-CNDs is observed to be 18 nM and 30 nM, respectively, in the linear response range of 0-2000 mu M with a short response time (seconds). The CNDs detect Fe (III) ions in tap water and serum sample with no spiking and the recovery was similar to 100% with the Fe (III) samples. Cellular internalization studies confirm the localization of the CNDs and the optical imaging sensing of Fe (III) ions inside living cells. A charge transfer fluorescence quenching mechanism, specifically between the CNDs and Fe (III), is proposed and examined using cyclic voltammetry. The overall characteristics of the E-CNDs provides a potential sensing platform in highly sensitive and selective detection of Fe (III) ions.

The rational design of electrochemically-modulated optical materials, especially those with multiple regulatory capacities, remains an unmet research challenge. We present here an optical composite, featuring multiple electrochemically-modulated properties, prepared through an electrochemistry-assisted hydrolytic crosslinking reaction between electroactive viologen and fluorescent carbon dots. Upon the electrochemical manipulation of the redox states of the viologen moieties, the resultant composite film exhibits interesting multistage regulated chromism with great color contrast, moderate switching rates, good coloration efficiency, and enhanced cycling stability. We demonstrate a unique sequential multistage regulated electrofluorochromism resulting from the inner filter effect and synergistic interplay between the electroactive viologen units and the fluorescent carbon dots. Furthermore, this optical composite reveals electrogenerated chemiluminescence with acceptable electrochemiluminescence intensity, attributed to the intrinsic behavior of carbon dots.

Facile fabrication and formation mechanism of aluminum nanowire arrays	NANOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						AAO; nano-imprint lithography; metal nanowire array; anodization	ORDERED POROUS ALUMINA; ANODIC OXIDE-FILMS; GROWTH	Anodized alumina membranes (AAMs) have proven effective at making vertically-oriented and well-ordered metal nanowire arrays, which are useful in plasmonics and electrochemistry. Here, we produced Al nanowires via directed AAM pore nucleation: a patterned oxide mask on a flat Al surface directed where pores did and did not form, the pores acting to oxidize Al around the sites without pores. This left Al nanowires embedded in the AAM, and produced freestanding Al nanowires after etching the AAM. The nanowire tops had two distinct contours, smooth bowls and flat rough surfaces-suggesting that nanowires with bowl tops result from slow pore development relative to pattern-nucleated pores, not pore blockage as prior literature suggests. The observed low porosity of similar to 2%, as opposed to the more typical 10%, suggests pore nucleation in the electrolyte employed may need greater local variations in electric field or pH, possibly explaining the electrolyte's peculiar ability to make Al nanowires. Finally, a soft nano-imprint lithography process was developed here to pattern the mask without damaging the stamp, avoiding a stamp degradation problem in previous work that utilized hard nano-imprint lithography.

Aramid nanofiber-reinforced three-dimensional graphene hydrogels for supercapacitor electrodes	JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Graphene oxide; Colloidal nanomaterials; Self-assembly; Electrochemistry; Energy storage; Supercapacitors; Nanofibers; Structural materials; Rheology; Sol-gel chemistry	FUNCTIONALIZED GRAPHENE; CHEMICAL-REDUCTION; ENERGY-STORAGE; OXIDE; AEROGELS; MONOMER	Hypothesis: Self-assembled graphene hydrogels are notable in the field of electrochemical energy storage for their unique combination of excellent specific surface area, high porosity, and electrically conductive continuous network. However, graphene hydrogels suffer from poor mechanical integrity compared to layered architectures like graphene buckypapers, limiting their applications in practical devices. We propose the use of high strength, Kevlarl (R)-derived polymeric nanofillers, aramid nanofibers (ANFs) as structural fillers to enhance graphene hydrogel's shear modulus in the context of multifunctional (mechanical and electrochemical) architectures. Experiments: Graphene hydrogels are fabricated using sol-gel self-assembly of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets in presence of ammonium hydroxide. Colloidal dispersion of ANFs and GO are integrated using a novel combination of solvent exchange and dialysis approach to fabricate GO-ANF hydrogels with 0-15 wt.% of ANFs loading (dry weight basis). Shear modulus and electrochemical properties of resulting hydrogel composites are evaluated using rheology and symmetric supercapacitor cell. Findings: The addition of 2 wt.% ANFs resulted in an 80% improvement in shear modulus compared to neat graphene hydrogel. Addition of ANFs resulted in gradual reduction of specific capacitance, with the specific capacitance of 190 F/g for neat graphene hydrogel, reducing to 128 F/g for an ANF loading of 15 wt.% (dry weight basis). This work shows the broader concept that adding high-strength nanofibers to a nanomaterial gel can add reinforcement provided that the gelation process itself is not disrupted. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Electron holography has proved successful in probing solid-solid interfaces but requires knowledge of the materials' mean inner potential (MIP, V-0), which is a fundamental bulk material property. Combining off-axis electron holography with liquid phase transmission electron microscopy (LPTEM), we provide the first quantitative MIP determination of liquid water V-0 = +4.48 +/- 0.19 V. This value is larger than most theoretical predictions, and to explain the disagreement we assess the dominant factors needed in quantum simulations of liquid water. A precise MIP lays the foundations for nanoscale holographic potential measurements in liquids, and provides a benchmark to improve quantum mechanical descriptions of aqueous systems and their interfaces in, e.g., electrochemistry, solvation processes, and spectroscopy.

Directly probing these interfaces during electrochemical reactions would significantly enrich the mechanistic understanding and inspire potential solutions for their regulation. Herein, the electrochemistry of the lithium/Li7La3Zr2O12-electrolyte interface is elucidated by probing lithium deposition through the electrolyte in an anode-free solid-state battery in real time. Lithium plating is strongly affected by the geometry of the garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) surface, where nonuniform/filamentary growth is triggered particularly at morphological defects. More importantly, lithium-growth behavior significantly changes when the LLZO surface is modified with an artificial interlayer to produce regulated lithium depositions. It is shown that lithium-growth kinetics critically depend on the nature of the interlayer species, leading to distinct lithium-deposition morphologies. Subsequently, the dynamic role of the interlayer in battery operation is discussed as a buffer and seed layer for lithium redistribution and precipitation, respectively, in tailoring lithium deposition. These findings broaden the understanding of the electrochemical lithium-plating process at the solid-electrolyte/lithium interface, highlight the importance of exploring various interlayers as a new avenue for regulating the lithium-metal anode, and also offer insight into the nature of lithium growth in anode-free solid-state batteries.

Thermodynamics of Antisite Defects in Layered NMC Cathodes: Systematic Insights from High-Precision Powder Diffraction Analyses	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							LITHIUM; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; OPTIMIZATION; ELECTRODES; DISORDER; BEHAVIOR	While it is accepted that paired Ni-Li and Li-Ni antisite defects are present in the important family of NMC cathode materials with the general formula Li(NixMnyCoz)O-2, their formation mechanism and influence on properties are not well understood due to the difficulty of accurately quantifying defects. In this work, novel high-precision powder diffraction methods have been used to elucidate the dependence of defect concentration on NMC composition. Formation energies for paired antisite defects (calculated under the assumption of equal state degeneracy) are observed to vary from about 320 to 160 meV, contradicting the constant defect formation energy that would be expected based on the previously proposed atomistic defect formation mechanism (size similarity of N2+ and Li+ cations). The present data support an alternative mechanism in which the equilibrium defect concentration is determined by the average size of transition-metal sites and thus suggest a new route by which chemical substitutions can be used to tune defect concentrations to optimal levels.

Probing Electrochemical Mg-Ion Activity in MgCr2-xVxO4 Spinel Oxides	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							CATHODE MATERIALS; MAGNESIUM; INTERCALATION; NMR; LITHIUM; ELECTROLYTE; BATTERIES; MECHANISM	Mg migration in oxide spinels is impeded by strong affinity between divalent Mg and oxygen, suggesting a necessity of exploring new chemistry of solid lattices for functional Mg-ion electrode materials. Cationic mobility with a suitable activation energy in Cr spinels is Tn. evidenced by theoretical and experimental results, while redox potentials of V are appropriate to operate with currently limited candidates of '''c" nonaqueous electrolytes. By controlling the structure, composition, and complexity, a largely solid-solution MgCrVO4 spinel was synthesized, which, unlike nanocornposites, can bring together the advantages of each transition metal in the lattice. The spinel was successfully synthesized by a simple solid-state reaction with minor inactive Cr- or V-rich components, which was confirmed via Mg-25 MAS NMR and high-resolution X-ray diffraction analyses. A thermally and anodically stable Mg(TPFA)(2)/triglyme electrolyte was utilized for high-temperature electrochemistry and lowering kinetic barriers at and across interfaces so as to observe intercalation behavior of Mg in the designed lattice. Multimodal characterization confirmed an apparent bulk demagnesiation from MgCrVO4 with partial reversibility by probing evolution of the local and long-range structure as well as vanadium and chromium electronic states within the lattice. Characterization experiments also provided a direct evidence for (de)intercalation reactions that occurred without any major competitive conversion reactions or insertion of protons into the lattice, except for the formation of a surface rock salt phase upon charge. These findings in Mg-ion activity expand opportunities to design Mg spinel oxide materials while highlighting the need to identify the origins of reversibility challenges due to, but not limited to, phase stability, particularly for the charged states, barriers at the interface, electrolyte stabilities, and desolvation phenomena, collectively hindering practical use as cathode materials.

Specifically, the battery's negative electrode, the anode, presents many unique chemical, physical and engineering challenges. Lithium-based battery technologies have dominated the past decade, but concerns about the limited supply of lithium in the Earth's crust have led researchers to look towards alternative metal-ion technologies. Various alkali metals (such as sodium and potassium) and alkali earth metals (such as magnesium and calcium) have attracted significant research interest. In this Review, we analyse these technologies in a coherent manner, addressing the problems of each type of anode, rather than those of specific types of metal-ion batteries. Covering direct metal plating and stripping, intercalation-based, alloy-based and conversion-reaction-based anode technologies, this analysis will offer the reader a comprehensive understanding of the behaviour of different metal-ion anodes and of what can be learned by transferring knowledge between these different systems. Increasing demand for energy-storage systems will inevitably stress the Earth's lithium supply; thus, the research focus is shifting towards other alkali and alkali earth metals. This Review compares and connects strategies to enable different multivalent and monovalent metal-ion battery anodes, including metal anodes and intercalation-based, alloy-based and conversion-reaction-based anodes.

Initially motivated as a strategy to protect the underlying semiconductor photoabsorber from harsh operating conditions, the thickness of the insulator layer in MIS systems has recently been shown to be a critical design parameter which can be tuned to optimize the photovoltage. This study analyzes the underlying mechanism by which the thickness of the insulator layer impacts the performance of MIS photo-electrocatalysts. A concrete example of an Ir/HfO2/n-Si MIS system is investigated for the oxygen evolution reaction. The results of combined experiments and modeling suggest that the insulator thickness affects the photovoltage i) favorably by controlling the flux of charge carriers from the semiconductor to the metal electrocatalyst and ii) adversely by introducing nonidealities such as surface defect states which limit the generated photovoltage. It is important to quantify these different mechanisms and suggest avenues for addressing these nonidealities to enable the rational design of MIS systems that can approach the fundamental photovoltage limits. The analysis described in this contribution as well as the strategy toward optimizing the photovoltage are generalizable to other MIS systems.

Nonadiabatic Molecular Dynamics at Metal Surfaces	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							ELECTRONIC FRICTION; VIBRATIONAL-EXCITATION; HOPPING ALGORITHM; ENERGY-TRANSFER; MODEL; DECOHERENCE; DERIVATION; SCATTERING; TRANSPORT; EQUATION	Dynamics at molecule-metal interfaces are a subject of intense current interest and come in many different flavors of experiments: gas-phase scattering, chemisorption, electrochemistry, nanojunction transport, and heterogeneous catalysis, to name a few. These dynamics involve nuclear degrees of freedom entangled with many electronic degrees of freedom (in the metal), and as such there is always the possibility for nonadiabatic phenomena to appear: the nuclei do not necessarily need to move slower than the electrons to break the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation. In this Feature Article, we review a set of dynamical methods developed recently to deal with such nonadiabatic phenomena at a metal surface, methods that serve as alternatives to Tully's independent electron surface hopping (IESH) model. In the weak molecule-metal coupling regime, a classical master equation (CME) can be derived and a simple surface hopping approach is proposed to propagate nuclear and electronic dynamics stochastically. In the strong molecule-metal interaction regime, a Fokker-Planck equation can be derived for the nuclear dynamics, with electronic DoFs incorporated into the overall friction and random force. Lastly, a broadened classical master equation (BCME) can interpolate between the weak and strong molecule-metal interactions. Here, we briefly review these methods and the relevant benchmarking data, showing in particular how the methods can be used to calculate nonequilibrium transport properties. We highlight several open questions and pose several avenues for future study.

Utilizing X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopies, as well as cyclic voltammetry measurements, herein, we elucidate chelation-based mechanisms for driving reactivity and initiating redox processes in a family of neptunyl-HOPO and CAM complexes. Based on the selected chelator, the ability to control the oxidation state of neptunium and the speed of reduction and concurrent oxo group activation was demonstrated. Most notably, reduction kinetics for the (NpO2+/)-O-V/Np-IV redox couple upon chelation by the ligands 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) and 3,4,3-LI(CAM)(2)(1,2-HOPO)(2) was observed to be faster than ever reported, and in fact quicker than we could measure using either X-ray absorption spectroscopy or electrochemical techniques.

Based on existing knowledge and educated guesses, we preselect Au/Nb, Au/Ta, Au/Mo, and Au/W as potential catalysts. Our calculations show that these materials are stable and have very high dissolution potentials. A deviation from the linear scaling for the binding energy of ORR intermediates, revealed for Au/Nb and Au/Ta, has a desired impact on the ORR thermodynamics. We find it to be a result of hybridization of p-electronic states of oxygen belonging the OOH-radical and Au-p(z) states. The calculated ORR free energy diagrams show that the ORR onset potentials for Au/Nb and Au/Ta are significantly higher than that for Pt. We thus predict two inexpensive, thermodynamically and electrochemically stable, and highly active ORR catalysts.

Conditioning-Free Mg Electrolyte by the Minor Addition of Mg(HMDS)(2)	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						magnesium electrolyte; magnesium electrodeposition; electrolyte speciation; conditioning-free electrolyte	WIDE ELECTROCHEMICAL WINDOWS; ALUMINUM-CHLORIDE COMPLEX; MAGNESIUM BOROHYDRIDE; EFFICIENT; SPECIATION; BATTERIES; SYSTEMS; ELECTRODEPOSITION; PERFORMANCE; STABILITY	Mg-based batteries are an attractive next generation energy storage chemistry due to the high natural abundance and inexpensive cost of Mg, along with the high theoretical energy density compared to that of conventional Li-ion chemistry. The greater energy density is predicated on a Mg metal anode, and pathways to achieving reversible Mg electrodeposition and stripping are reliant on the development of Mg electrolytes. Although Mg electrolyte chemistry has advanced significantly from the reactive Grignards of the 1920s to the carboranes of this decade, there remains significant challenges in correlating the Mg metal anode electrochemistry with the composition of the electrolyte salts as a result of the complicated interface of Mg metal and the electrolyte. To probe the effect of the interface on Mg electrodeposition, we turn to an electrolyte with a known solution-phase composition: the magnesium aluminum chloride complex (MACC) electrolyte. The MACC electrolyte requires electrolytic conditioning to support reversible Mg electrodeposition and stripping. Here, we show that a small concentration (2-5 mM) of Mg(HMDS)(2) with respect to the MACC electrolyte salts suppresses Al3+ deposition and promotes reversible Mg electrodeposition and stripping in the first cycle. The significant effect of a small concentration of additive is attributed to changes to the electrode interface. The impact of the Mg interface on the observed electrochemical performance is discussed.

Stereoelectronic and Resonance Effects on the Rate of Ring Opening of N-Cyclopropyl-Based Single Electron Transfer Probes	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							ARYLCYCLOPROPANE CATION RADICALS; HOMOGENEOUS REDOX CATALYSIS; 3-ELECTRON S(N)2 REACTIONS; MONOAMINE-OXIDASE-B; ELECTROCHEMICAL REACTIONS; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; HYDROGEN ABSTRACTION; MECHANISTIC PROBES; DEALKYLATION; OXIDATION	N-Cyclopropyl-N-methylaniline (5) is a poor probe for single electron transfer (SET) because the corresponding radical cation undergoes cyclopropane ring opening with a rate constant of only 4.1 x 10(4) s(-1), too slow to compete with other processes such as radical cation deprotonation. The sluggish rate of ring opening can be attributed to either (i) a resonance effect in which the spin and charge of the radical cation in the ring-closed form is delocalized into the phenyl ring, and/or (ii) the lowest energy conformation of the SET product (5(circle+)) does not meet the stereoelectronic requirements for cyclopropane ring opening. To resolve this issue, a new series of N-cyclopropylanilines were designed to lock the cyclopropyl group into the required bisected conformation for ring opening. The results reveal that the rate constant for ring opening of radical cations derived from 1'-methyl-3',4'-dihydro-1'H-spiro[cyclopropane-1,2'-quinoline] (6) and 6'-chloro-1'-methyl-3',4'-dihydro-1'H-spiro[cyclopropane-1,2'-quinoline] (7) are 3.5 x 10(2) s(-1) and 4.1 x 10(2) s(-1), effectively ruling out the stereoelectronic argument. In contrast, the radical cation derived from 4-chloro-N-methyl-N-(2-phenylcyclopropyl)aniline (8) undergoes cyclopropane ring opening with a rate constant of 1.7 x 10(8) s(-1), demonstrating that loss of the resonance energy associated with the ring-closed form of these N-cyclopropylanilines can be amply compensated by incorporation of a radical-stabilizing phenyl substituent on the cyclopropyl group.

J	Wang, YF; Gordon, E; Ren, H				Wang, Yufei; Gordon, Emma; Ren, Hang			Mapping the Potential of Zero Charge and Electrocatalytic Activity of Metal-Electrolyte Interface via a Grain-by-Grain Approach	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							IN-SITU; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; PLATINUM; PT(111); SURFACES; STATE	Potential of zero charge (PZC) is a fundamental quantity that dictates the structure of the electrical double layer. Studies using single crystals suggest a polycrystalline surface should display an inhomogeneous distribution of PZC and electric field, which directly affects the electrochemical energy storage and conversion processes occurring at the electrode-electrolyte interface. Herein, we demonstrate the direct mapping of local PZC using scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM). The potential-dependent charging current upon the formation of the microscopic electrode-electrolyte interface is used to determine the PZC. Using polycrystalline Pt as a model system, correlative SECCM and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) images show the dependence of PZC on the local crystal grain orientation. The electrocatalytic activity can be mapped from the same SECCM experiment via local voltammetry, which demonstrates the variation of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity across Pt grains. The method reported here can be readily applied to study other electrochemical interfaces, providing rich correlative information on the surface property and electrocatalytic activities.

The resultant corrole-based COF, TPAPC-COF, exhibits high crystallinity and excellent chemical stability. The combination of extended pi-conjugated backbone and interlayer noncovalent pi-pi interactions endows TPAPC-COF with excellent absorption capability in the entire visible-light and even near-infrared regions. Moreover, this work suggests the promise of TPAPC-COF as a new class of photoactive material for efficient singlet-oxygen generation with potential photodynamic therapy application as demonstrated by in vitro anticancer studies.

The most critical challenge for Na-ion batteries is to develop high-capacity and long-lifespan electrode materials which are comparable to Li-ion batteries. Herein, we use a simple method to prepare nanoflake-constructed microflowers layered sodium vanadium oxide (NaV6O15) via self-assembled process. As cathode material of sodium ion battery, the prepared NaV6O15 microflowers deliver a capacity of 126 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1). Significantly, the capacity can remain 87% after 2000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g(-1). This superior performance can be attributed to the continuous electron transport pathway, improved electrical conductivity, and excellent stress relaxation, which are revealed by the electrochemical kinetics and structure evolution studies of the material in the cell.

Coupled with two-dimensional graphene, the obtained TiB2@G separator fulfills a synergistic combination of strong physical and chemical sulfur immobilization as well as a high-efficiency sulfur reutilization, thus establishing a robust barrier against the polysulfide shuttling and enabling a fast and durable sulfur electrochemistry. As a result, cells based on TiB2@G separator exhibit a high sulfur utilization with 1350 mA h g(-1) capacity at 0.05C, superb rate capability up to 5.0C, and excellent cyclability with a high capacity retention over 85% after 300 cycles at 0.5C. Moreover, significantly mitigated self-discharge and considerably high areal capacity of 5.8 mA h cm(-2) can be also achieved, indicating the great promise of this separator design for the development of high-performance Li-S batteries.

Such measurements are crucial for understanding structure-activity relationships relevant to a wide range of applications in material science, life science and chemical processes. AFM-SECM integrates classic SECM and AFM to achieve on-step acquisition of unparalleled high-spatial-resolution surface topology and nanoscale electrochemical images and holds promising potential to unveil fundamental interfacial properties or activity at nanoscale. Despite the rapid development of AFM-SECM, its unique principles, capabilities, and applications have not been sufficiently understood and utilized. The present review provides a short critical overview of the evolution of AFM-SECM, the major principles and operation modes as well as the AFM-SECM probe designs. The current applications of AFM-SECM in materials, biological and chemical sciences are critically discussed to highlight the remaining challenges of the AFM-SECM and perspectives on its further development.

Each complex displays two quasireversible redox couples, which are proposed to correspond to a reduction of Co(II) to Co(I), followed by a ligand-based reduction. Irreversible reductions of 1 are observed at more negative potentials, and are proposed to arise from deposition of elemental Co and the decomposition of transiently formed Co(-I) species. Spectroelectrochemical experiments on both 1 and 2, involving electrolytic reduction followed by reoxidation, are consistent with the quasireversibility observed in the CV measurements.

To construct such a versatile platform, the model analyte, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), was captured by magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles bound with primary antibodies (Fe3O4-Ab(1)) and then recognized by the detection antibodies conjugated complex containing poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM), carbon nanotube (CNT) and carboxyl functionalized CdSe nanocrystals (NCs) (CNT-PAMAM-CdSe NCs-Ab(2)). Via ligand exchange, the stable CdSe nanocrystals were easily functionalized with carboxylate ion (CdSe-COO-) and showed high hydrophilicity. The CdSe-COO- was effectively and densely conjugated to CNT coated dendrimer PAMAM that possesses large specific surface area. Finally, the target CEA was detected based on cation-exchange reaction (CER) by adding Ag+ to release thousands of cations Cd2+, which were detected by fluorescence and electrochemistry simultaneously. The electrochemical measurement was performed by directly detecting Cd2+ through square wave voltammetry (SWV), which displayed an excellent correlation with CEA from 5 pg/mL to 50 ng/mL, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.7 pg/mL. The fluorescence detection was implemented since free Cd2+ could trigger the weak fluorescence metal-sensitive dyes (Rhod-5N) to generate extremely high fluorescence signal. The fluorescence results showed the LOD for CEA detection was 0.25 pg/mL with a calibration curve range from 1 pg/mL to 20 ng/mL. The dual signal outputs showed an attractively self-correcting ability, which provides the capability of avoiding false positive signal and making the detection result more reliable. The proposed dual-responsive platform holds great promises for biomarkers detection in clinical diagnostics and therapy. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Lu, LQ; Pei, F; Abeln, T; Pei, YT				Lu, Liqiang; Pei, Fei; Abeln, Thom; Pei, Yutao			Tailoring three-dimensional interconnected nanoporous graphene micro/nano-foams for lithium-sulfur batteries	CARBON			English	Article							CARBON; CATHODE; SIZE; CONVERSION; ELECTRODE; FACILE; NICKEL; GROWTH; METAL	Three-dimensional interconnected nanoporous graphene (NPG) microfoams and nanofoams are developed via a new approach of solid-state catalytic growth. Both NPG microfoam and nanofoam exhibit similar nanoporous structures that contain close tubular pores and open non-tubular pores but with different particle sizes. As electrochemical reactors for sulfur cathodes, sulfur is encapsulated inside the tubular pores. It is found that NPG nanoreactors can enhance the electrochemical performances in comparison with NPG microreactors, including improved reversible capacities, cyclic performances and rate performances in particular. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis reveals that NPG nanoreactors facilitate Li+ transportation and decrease the charge-transfer resistance in comparison with the microreactors, promoting the redox kinetics of multi-step conversions between sulfur and lithium sulfides. This work demonstrates a significant particle size effect of nanoporous graphene on the Li-S electrochemistry and can be useful for designing Li-S batteries as well as other electrochemical energy storage systems.

Using electron backscatter diffraction, we found that dealloying of both sets of Cu-Au samples leaves the grain orientations and grain shapes essentially unaltered with respect to that of the parent phase alloys. The mean ligament diameter, characterized by digital image analysis, made from the disordered alloy was 124 nm and that from the ordered alloy was 135 nm.

In continuation of our previous work on rhenium pincer mediated N-2 splitting, nitrogen activation and cleavage upon (electro)chemical reduction of [ReCl2(L2)] {L2 = N(CHCHPtBu2)(2)(-)} is reported. The electrochemical characterization of [ReCl2(L2)] and comparison with our previously reported platform [ReCl2(L1)] {L1 = N(CH2CH2PtBu2)(2)(-)} provides mechanistic insight to rationalize the dependence of nitride yield on the reductant. Furthermore, the reactivity of N-2 derived nitride complex [Re(N)Cl(L2)] with electrophiles is presented.

However, nitrogen is an unreactive molecule and the hydrogen evolution reaction presents a major selectivity challenge. An electrode of electrodeposited lithium in tetrahydrofuran solvent overcomes both problems by providing a surface that easily reacts with nitrogen and by limiting the access of protons with a nonaqueous electrolyte. Under these conditions, we measure relatively high faradaic efficiencies (ca. 10 %) and rates (0.1 mA cm(-2)) toward NH3. We observe the development of a solid electrolyte interface layer as well as the accumulation of lithium and lithium-containing species. Detailed DFT studies suggest lithium nitride and hydride to be catalytically active phases given their thermodynamic and kinetic stability relative to metallic lithium under reaction conditions and the fast diffusion of nitrogen in lithium.

An important class of cathodes, known as Li-rich layered oxides, Li-Ni-Mn-Co-O, is considered promising for next-generation electrode materials, yet a poor understanding of a number of detrimental processes, for which the underlying mechanisms are not clear, has hindered their commercialization. Numerous model systems have been studied in an effort to fully understand the discrete mechanisms taking place during battery operation. Given that Ni is relied upon more and more in commercial materials, we build here upon the previous work on model systems by studying Li-Ni-Sb-O and Li-Ni-Te-O materials to better understand the impact of Ni substitution into this complex class of materials. Using a combination of detailed electrochemical tests, X-ray diffraction, online electrochemical mass spectrometry, X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy, and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, we find a stark contrast between the electrochemistry taking place in the bulk of particles as compared to that taking place at the surface. We find that oxidation of oxygen results in reduction of nickel, as was seen previously in Li-Fe-Sb-O, and this has a detrimental impact on the discharge capacity. However, the reductive couple occurs solely at the surface of particles in Ni-containing materials because of mitigated oxygen gas production in these materials. The consequences of this contrast between the surface and the bulk are discussed to guide further development of next-generation electrodes.

We have been developing a four-way junction (4WJ)-based sensor that consists of a universal stem-loop (USL) probe immobilized on an electrode surface and two adaptor strands (M and F). The sensor was shown to be highly selective towards single base mismatches at room temperature, able to detect multiple targets using the same USL probe, and have improved ability to detect folded nucleic acids. However, some nucleic acid targets, including natural RNA, are folded into very stable secondary and tertiary structures, which may represent a challenge even for the 4WJ sensors. This work describes a new sensor, named MVF since it uses three probe stands M, V and F, which further improves the performance of 4WJ sensors with folded targets. The MVF sensor interrogating a 16S rRNA NASBA amplicon with calculated folding energy of -32.82 kcal/mol has demonstrated 2.5-fold improvement in a signal-to-background ratio in comparison with a 4WJ sensor lacking strand V. The proposed design can be used as a general strategy in the analysis of folded nucleic acids including natural RNA.

Using a 20 nm radius nanopipette and hopping mode scanning, the resolution of SECCM was beyond the optical microscopy limit and visualized a small triangular MoS2 nanosheet with a side length of ca. 130 nm. The electrochemical cell provides local cyclic voltammograms with a nanoscale spatial resolution for visualizing HER active sites as electrochemical images. The HER activity difference of edge, terrace, and heterojunction of MoS2 and WS2 were revealed.

The properties of the complexes are evaluated as a function of the donor ligands, and correlations are drawn among electrochemical, optical, and theoretical data. Special focus has been put on the spectroelectrochemical investigation of the complexes featuring sulfonyl-substituted phenylendiamide ligands, which show redox-induced linkage isomerism upon oxidation. Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) as well as electron flux density analysis have been employed to rationalize the optical spectra of the complexes and their reactivity. Compound 1 ([(pimp)Pt(Q(2-))] with Q(2-)=3,5-di-tert-butylcatecholate) was shown to be an efficient photosensitizer for molecular oxygen and was subsequently employed in photochemical cross-dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reactions. The results thus display new avenues for donor-acceptor systems, including their role as photocatalysts for organic transformations, and the possibility to introduce redox-induced linkage isomerism in these compounds through the use of sulfonamide substituents on the donor ligands.

Enzyme Kinetics via Open Circuit Potentiometry	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							PROTEIN FILM VOLTAMMETRY; POTENTIAL BIOSENSOR; REDOX ENZYMES; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; ELECTRODE	We demonstrate the application of open circuit potentiometry (OCP) to measure enzyme turnover kinetics, kappa(turn). The electrode surface will become poised by the addition of a well-behaved redox pair, such as ferrocenemethanol/ferrocenium methanol (FcMeOH/FcMeOH(+)), which acts as the cosubstrate for the enzymatic process. A measurable change in potential results when an enzyme consumes the one-electron transfer mediator. Glucose oxidase was studied as a test-case, but the method is generalizable across oxidoreductase enzymes that rely on electron transfer mediators. In the presence of glucose and FcMeOH(+), glucose oxidase delivers electrons to FcMeOH(+), and the potential changes with respect to the Nernst equation. A theoretical model incorporating enzymatic rate expressions into the Nernst equation was derived to explain the observed potential transients, and experimental data fit theory well. A similar experiment was performed using amperometry on ultramicroelectrodes (UMEs). Here, the same enzymatic rate expression may be incorporated into the equation for steady-state flux to an UME to obtain kappa(turn). While similar kinetic information was obtained from the potentiometric and amperometric responses, potentiometry is independent of electrode size and mass transfer effects. Finally, we show how kappa(turn) changes as a function of one-electron mediator. Our results may eventually find applications to biosensors, where electrode fouling plagues long-term sensor performance.

Soft mixed ionic-electronic conductive electrodes for noninvasive stimulation	JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE			English	Article; Early Access						applications; biomedical applications; conducting polymers; electrochemistry	IMPEDANCE SPECTROSCOPY; SKIN; VALIDATION	A new material, classified as a soft mixed ionic-electronic conductor (MIEC), was fabricated through casting and curing of different ratios of single walled carbon nanotube (SWNTs), hyaluronic acid (HA), and acrylonitrile butadiene copolymer latex (NBR) and developed for noninvasive stimulation for electrotherapeutics. The morphology of the composite yielded high electrical conductivity and retention of elasticity. The interfacial charge transfer of the material showed that by increasing the HA loading the capacitive contribution decreased, while increasing SWNT loading decreased the interfacial resistance. The soft MIEC materials interfacial charge transfer was superior than current state-of-the art electrodes on the market. A layered configuration with high HA ratio at the skin interface and high SWNTs ratio at the stainless-steel interface was created to induce the most optimal charge transfer. These soft MIEC electrodes will be extremely helpful in electrotherapeutic applications to eliminate the need for hydrogels, which can be unsuitable due the their lack long term durability and instability.

Single-chromophore single-molecule photocatalyst for the production of dihydrogen using low-energy light	NATURE CHEMISTRY			English	Article							HYDROGEN-PRODUCTION; PHOTOREDOX CATALYSIS; EXCITED-STATES; H-2 EVOLUTION; COMPLEX; WATER; REDUCTION; CO2; DRIVEN; ELECTROCHEMISTRY	Single-chromophore single-molecule photocatalysts for the conversion and storage of solar energy into chemical bonds are rare, inefficient and do not use significant portions of the visible spectrum. Here we show a new, air-stable bimetallic scaffold that acts as a single-chromophore photocatalyst for hydrogen-gas generation and operates with irradiation wavelengths that span the ultraviolet to the red/near-infrared. Irradiation in acidic solutions that contain an electron donor results in the catalytic production of hydrogen with 170 +/- 5 turnovers in 24 hours and an initial rate of 28 turnovers per hour. The catalysis proceeds through two stepwise excited-state redox events-atypical of the currently known homogeneous photocatalysis-and features the storage of multiple redox equivalents on a dirhodium catalyst enabled by low-energy light. Homogeneous photocatalysts for the conversion and storage of solar energy typically feature separate sensitizer-catalyst assemblies, whereas previous examples of single-chromophore single-molecule photocatalysts are inefficient and do not use significant portions of the visible spectrum. Now a dirhodium single-chromophore single-molecule catalyst has been developed that generates hydrogen using low-energy light through a previously unobserved mechanism.	[Whittemore, T.

The diameter of the oil droplets increased to 55.0 mu m from the initial 7.0 mu m after treating the emulsion with the electrochemical micromembrane technology. Chemical oxygen demand removal rate and oil recovery reached 87.89% and 5173 mg/L, respectively, after cycling for 90 min at 10.0 V voltage with a 10.0 mm electrode distance, a 5.0 mu m micromembrane pore size and a 0.5 L/min flow rate. Micromembrane pore sizes of 1.0 and 5.0 mu m were both effective for decreasing chemical oxygen demand and recovering oil. The recovered oil was the mixture of mineral oil and ester according to the Raman infrared spectroscopy analysis. Surface charge redistribution and electrogenerated destruction for hydrophilic groups of surfactant molecules are responsible for oil coalescence. The electrochemical micromembrane technology used in this study offer an attractive treatment option to demulsify oily wastewater. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Modeling Interfacial Electron Transfer in the Double Layer: The Interplay between Electrode Coupling and Electrostatic Driving	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							ELECTROCHEMICAL ELECTRON; TRANSFER-COEFFICIENT; CHARGE-DISTRIBUTION; REACTION SITE; FREE-ENERGY; REDUCTION; ELECTROREDUCTION; ION; TRANSPORT; PLATINUM	In this manuscript, we present a theoretical model for studying the population dynamics of electrochemical systems within the region of the electrical double layer. We formulate this model in a coordinate system that separately resolves both the transport of redox species in the direction perpendicular to the electrode surface and the thermal fluctuations of the solvent environment that drive electron transfer. This formulation enables us to explore how the observable characteristics of electrochemical systems are influenced by spatial variations in the electric fields and electronic couplings that are inherent to the double layer, especially under conditions of low ionic strength, where screening lengths are larger. We apply this model to highlight the fundamental interplay between two physical attributes of interfacial electrochemistry: electrode coupling and electrostatic driving. Using a simple model system designed to isolate this interplay, we demonstrate how variations in the location of electron transfer can lead to systematic changes to the electrochemical transfer coefficient. We also illustrate that for certain redox reactions, differences in electrostatic driving between products and reactants can lead to nonmonotonic current-voltage behavior.

We fabricate thin films of "pyrolytic carbon" (pyC) by decomposition of benzene at 1000 degrees C and examine the physical and electrochemical properties of the native pyC film, as well as variants after heteroatom doping, plasma oxidation, and metal nanoparticle modification. The pyC films are optically reflective at the macroscale, relatively planar (1-3 nm RMS roughness by atomic force microscopy) and disordered (via Raman scattering). Thiophenyl-doped pyC films (0.6-1.7 atom % sulfur) suitably mimic the disorder, chemical state (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy), and work function (Kelvin probe) of a workhorse carbon black, Vulcan XC-72. Using ferri/ferrocyanide as a redox probe, we find that oxygen functionalities enhance the heterogeneous electron-transfer rate constant up to 3x, while high levels of sulfur dopants decrease the rate 2x. We also explore thiophenyl-directed adsorption of Au nanoparticles and show that hydrogen evolution at 0.1 mA cm(-2) occurs similar to 95 mV more positive at <1 % Au@pyC similar to S than at pyC similar to S.

The small innersphere reorganizations, lambda(i), for Ru-III/P-II and TPA(+/0) make them excellent probes of outer-sphere reorganization energy, lambda(o), as lambda(i) << lambda(o) such that lambda = lambda(i) +lambda(o) approximate to lambda(o). Consecutive layer-by-layer addition of Zr-IV-bridged methylenediphosphonic acid enabled positioning at distances from 4 to 27 angstrom from the ITO. Excited-state injection into the ITO by RuP* generated ITO(e(-))vertical bar (RuP)-P-III. For ITO cofunctionalized with TPA and RuP, subnanosecond lateral ET yielded ITO(e(-))ITPA(+). The kinetics for ET from ITO to (RuP)-P-III or TPA(+) were quantified spectroscopically as a function of applied potential (E-app) and hence driving force, -Delta G(o). Marcus-Gerischer analysis of this data provided lambda. Significantly, lambda(o) was near zero at close electrode proximity, lambda = 0.11 eV at a distance of similar to 4 angstrom, as manifest by kinetics largely insensitive to E-app. In agreement with dielectric continuum theory, lambda increased to values expected in CH3CN solution when the molecule was positioned at a distance of similar to 27 angstrom (lambda = 0.94 eV). The data reveal small intrinsic barriers for electron transfer proximate to conductive interfaces, which is an exploitable behavior in solar energy conversion and other applications that utilize transparent conductive oxides to accept or deliver electrons.

This confinement was breached in recent years when unusual properties were found to arise from the excessive salt presence, which often bring benefits to electrochemical, thermal, transport, interfacial, and interphasial properties that are of significant interest to the electrochemical energy storage community. This article provides an overview on this newly discovered and under-explored realm, with emphasis placed on their applications in rechargeable batteries.

In this paper, a type of TI-MOP (MIL-125) was prepared. Bi2WO6 nanosheets were in-situ formed on the outer surface of MIL-125(Ti) to construct MIL-125(Ti)/Bi2WO6 composites. The crystalline structures of the composites were explored by XRD, XPS and FT-IR, the morphologies were scrutinized employing SEM and TEM characterizations, the photochemistry and electrochemistry performance of the samples were studied via DRS, PL, EIS and transient photocurrent analysis. The results show that the composites possess lager specific surface area, higher visible-light harvest as well as stronger photocurrent compared to the pure material, which matched the enhanced photocatalytic performance. The 5 wt% MIL-125(Ti)/Bi2WO6 composites showed the best performance. Superoxide radicals and holes were the staple active substances for photodegradation from the ESR and free radicals trapping tests, and the possible photocatalytic mechanisms were deduced.

These ligands are of particular interest as the steric and electronic properties of the phosphorus donor atoms can be altered by changing the substituents of the phosphines. In addition, the ferrocene backbone of the ligands provides unique electronic and conformational flexibility to these ligands. Previous investigations in this lab have examined catalytic ring closing reactions using a series of gold compounds with bis(phosphino)ferrocene ligands, [Au2Cl2(mu-PP)]. These gold compounds were shown to react with sodium tetrakis(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)borate, Na[BArF24], to generate a cationic species with the general formula [Au-2(mu-Cl)(mu-PP)][BArF24] that are much more efficient catalysts than the [Au2Cl2(mu-PP)] compounds. In this study, a series of [Au2Cl2(mu-PP)] (mu-PP = 1,1'-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (dppf), 1,1'-bis(diiso-propylphosphino)ferrocene (dippf), 1,1'-bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)ferrocene (dcpf), 1,1'-bis(ditert-butylphosphino)ferrocene (dtbpf), 1-diphenylphosphino-1'-ditert-butylphosphinoferrocene (dppdtbpf) or 1,1'-bis(5-methyl-2-furanylphosphino)ferrocene (dfurpf)) compounds were examined as catalysts for the intramolecular ring-closing hydroamination of 3-(vinyloxy)propan-1-amine and the intermolecular hydroamination of phenylacetylene with a variety of phenylamine reagents. The catalytic activity of the corresponding [Au-2(mu-Cl)(mu-PP)][BArF24] compounds that were generated in situ was also explored. Two new [Au2Cl2(mu-PP)] compounds with chiral bis(phosphino)ferrocene ligands (PP = 1,1'-bis(2R,5R-dimethylphospholanyl)ferrocene (R-d(Me)plf) or 1,1'-bis(2S,5S-dimethylphospholanyl)ferrocene (S-d(Me)plf)) were prepared, characterized spectroscopically and electrochemically, and evaluated as catalysts in the ring-closing hydroamination reaction. In addition, the X-ray structures of [Au2Cl2(mu-PP)] (PP = dppdtbpf, R-d(Me)plf and S-d(Me)plf) were determined. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Hao, R; Peng, ZY; Zhang, B				Hao, Rui; Peng, Zhuoyu; Zhang, Bo			Single-Molecule Fluorescence Microscopy for Probing the Electrochemical Interface	ACS OMEGA			English	Review							SPECTROELECTROCHEMISTRY; NANOPARTICLES	The electrochemical interface is an ultrathin interfacial region between the electrode and solution where electrochemical reactions occur. The study of the electrochemical interface continues to be one of the most exciting directions in modern electrochemistry research. Much of our existing knowledge about the electrochemical interface comes from ensemble measurements and ex situ imaging of the electrode surface. Due to its enormous complexity and highly dynamic nature however, new imaging tools that can probe the interface in situ with ultrahigh spatial and temporal resolution and single-molecule sensitivity are apparently needed. Single-molecule fluorescence microscopy (SMFM) has emerged as a powerful tool that is uniquely suited for studying the electrochemical interface. In this mini-review, we first give a brief overview of various existing SMFM methods for studying electrochemical problems. We then discuss several exciting research topics involving the use of SMFM methods for studying surface-immobilized molecules, single freely diffusing molecules, single molecules as catalytic reaction indicators, and single-molecule labeling and imaging of interfacial nanobubbles. We anticipate that we will continue to see a rapid increase in publications on stochastic electrochemistry of single molecules and nanoparticles. The increased use of SMFM will likely bring new information to our study of the electrochemical interface.

Ethynylphenyl-Derivatized Free Base Porphyrins: Anodic Oxidation Processes and Covalent Grafting onto Glassy Carbon Electrodes	LANGMUIR			English	Article							ZINC TETRAPHENYLPORPHYRIN; HALOGENATED PORPHYRINS; CATION RADICALS; REDUCTION; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; ATTACHMENT; FILMS; MOLECULES; SURFACES; POLYMER	In six of seven cases, direct anodic oxidation of the ethynyl group of an ethynylphenyl-derivatized free-base porphyrin gave modified glassy carbon electrodes in which the porphyrin was strongly surface-bound, most likely in a perpendicular geometry through covalent attachment of the ethynyl group to a surface carbon atom. The porphyrins each contained an ethynylphenyl group in one meso position and varied in the groups present in the other three meso positions. Electrografted 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(ethynylphenyl)porphyrin, H(2)1, which has ethynyl moieties in all four meso positions, has well-defined surface voltammetry and grows to multilayer levels upon repeated cyclic voltammetry (CV) deposition scans. Multilayering was not observed to the same degree for monoethynylphenyl-substituted porphyrins and became progressively less for porphyrins having groups in the 15-meso position that were more protective against ethynyl radical attack. Clean molecular monolayer-level coverage was observed for 5-ethynylpheny1-10,20-bis(3-methoxypheny1)-15-hexylporphyrin, H(2)5. Owing to the fact that the ethynyl oxidation potential (1.1 to 1.5 V vs ferrocene) is more positive than that of the second macrocycle oxidation, the longevities and follow-up reactions of the porphyrin dications were also studied by CV, chemical oxidation, and optical spectroscopy in homogeneous solution. The primary follow-up products of the doubly oxidized porphyrins, whether surface-bound or in solution, were pyrrole-protonated species that were easily reduced back to the neutral porphyrin.

Manthiram and colleagues review the materials design strategies and discuss the challenges and solutions for low-cobalt, high-energy-density cathodes. High-nickel layered oxide cathode materials will be at the forefront to enable longer driving-range electric vehicles at more affordable costs with lithium-based batteries. A continued push to higher energy content and less usage of costly raw materials, such as cobalt, while preserving acceptable power, lifetime and safety metrics, calls for a suite of strategic compositional, morphological and microstructural designs and efficient material production processes. In this Perspective, we discuss several important design considerations for high-nickel layered oxide cathodes that will be implemented in the automotive market for the coming decade. We outline various intrinsic restraints of maximizing their energy output and compare current/emerging development roadmaps approaching low-/zero-cobalt chemistry. Materials production is another focus, relevant to driving down costs and addressing the practical challenges of high-nickel layered oxides for demanding vehicle applications. We further assess a series of stabilization techniques on their prospects to fulfill the aggressive targets of vehicle electrification.

Discharging behavior of confined bipolar electrodes: Coupled electrokinetic and electrochemical dynamics	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Bipolar electrochemistry; Electrical double layers; Induced-charge electrokinetics; Discharging dynamics; Nanofluidics	IMPEDANCE SPECTROSCOPY; ENERGY; SURFACE; MICROCHANNEL; VOLTAMMETRY; HYDROGEN; BATTERY; STORAGE; CHARGE	In this study we numerically investigate the intimately coupled transient electrokinetic and electrochemical dynamics of a nanoconfined bipolar electrode system, using experimental results to guide our analysis. Our recently developed 2D numerical model implements the Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Stokes system of equations to describe nanoscale chemical species transport by advection, migration, and diffusion, as well as the presence of both homogenous and heterogeneous reactions. By eschewing the assumption of electroneutrality and resolving diffuse-charge screening effects, our model uniquely accounts for a wide range of nonlinear transient effects including bipolar electrode (BPE) surface polarization, Faradaic charge accumulation, induced-charge electroosmotic flow, and ion concentration polarization. Using this model, we demonstrate that upon the removal of a polarizing electric field, excess accumulated charge at a BPE surface electrochemically discharges following the capacitive relaxation of diffuse space charge in the electrical double layers (EDLs) surrounding the BPE extremities. These EDLs continue to polarize the BPE as they relax by a process of drift-diffusion, wherein the counterionic space charge at each pole promotes a large influx of oppositely charged ions to restore electroneutrality. We numerically reproduced this electrokinetic enhancement effect that was first observed in a recently reported experimental system in which charged fluorophores were used as tracer molecules. Our results also support experimental evidence that, following capacitive EDL relaxation, nanoconfined BPEs can exhibit pseudocapacitance-like discharging behavior that is localized to a single end of the electrode; we experimentally linked this localization to surface oxidation of the anodic BPE pole under the applied field. In addition to providing important insight into the interplay between nanoscale electrokinetic and electrochemical phenomena that govern transient electrode processes, our model and the results presented in this work reinforce the notion that the domain of bipolar electrochemistry constitutes a promising frontier for developing "wirelessly" tunable charge storage and visual detection approaches which exploit both electrokinetic and Faradaic mechanisms.

Free Energy Dependence of Photoinduced Electron Transfer in Octathiophene-Diimide Dyads	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							CHARGE SEPARATION; PHOTOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES; RATE CONSTANTS; RECOMBINATION; DISTANCE; EFFICIENCY; MOLECULES; SOLVENT; SYSTEMS; SINGLET	Donor-acceptor dyads consisting of octathiophene (T-8) paired with three (di)imide acceptors (naphthalene diimide (NDI), benzene diimide (BDI), and naphthalimide (NI)) were synthesized and probed for their photoinduced forward electron transfer (ET) and charge recombination kinetics by using ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. The three acceptors have different electron affinities, leading to variation in the energy of the charge-separated state and the driving force (Delta G) for forward ET and charge recombination. Analysis of the TA spectra and kinetics allows assignment of rates for forward ET and charge recombination for each of the oligomers. Electrochemistry and photoluminescence spectroscopy are used to determine the Delta G values for the ET processes. For two of the oligomers (T8NDI and T8BDI), the rates for forward ET and charge recombination are very rapid (k > 3 X 10(10) s(-1)). By contrast, for the third oligomer (T8NI), the rates for both processes are considerably slower (k < 5 X 10(9) s(-1)). Analysis of the rate/free energy correlation for the series of oligomers reveals generally good agreement with the Marcus semiclassical theory. In all of the oligomers, the ET reactions are nonadiabatic, in part, due to weak coupling caused by out-of-plane twisting of the phenylene spacer that lies between the T-8 segment and the (di)imide acceptors. The rapid ET dynamics for T8NDI and T8BDI are explained as arising due to the processes occurring near the barrierless region (-Delta G approximate to lambda) or slightly into the Marcus inverted region (-Delta G > lambda). The slower dynamics for T8NI are explained as arising because the forward ET is weakly exothermic, whereas charge recombination is deep into the inverted region. This study is the first to produce experimental results that match a full Marcus bell-shaped curve with ET rates in the normal, barrrierless, and inverted regions in dyads based on a pi-conjugated oligomer donor.

Unfortunately, the conventional methods of QD synthesis are hazardous and time-consuming. In this work, we present an alternative method of fabricating cadmium selenide (CdSe) QDs (via rapid microwave synthesis). This novel fabrication method provides a quick and efficient way to synthesize QDs that are almost identical to those commercially available. We also demonstrate the tuning of QD sizes by varying time and temperature during the growth process. Optical spectroscopy was used to measure the emission profile of QDs of various sizes. With ease repeatability, tunability, and scalability, this QD synthesis method can be integrated into a wide range of applications and optoelectronic devices.

They are therefore highly desired in various applications. Despite the advantages and needs, they face great challenges in technique especially when integrating sensors with different sensing principles. To bridge the gap between the demand and technique, we here demonstrated an integration of electrochemical and colorimetric sensors with a webcam readout for multiple gas detection. Designed with two parallel gas channels but independent sensor cells, the dual-sensor detector could simultaneously detect each gas from their gas mixture by analysis of the group photo of the two sensors. Using Ag electro-dissolution as reporter, the bipolar electrochemical sensor achieved quantitative analysis for the first time thanks to application of pulse voltage. The sacrificed Ag layer used in the bipolar electrochemical (EC) sensor was recycled from CD, which further decreased the sensor cost and supplied a new way of CD recycling. The EC O-2, sensor response, edge displacement of Ag layer due to electrochemical dissolution, has a linear relationship with O-2 concentration ranging from 0 to 30% and has good selectivity to common oxidative gases. The colorimetric NO2 sensor linearly responded to NO2 concentrations ranging from 0 to 230 ppb with low detection limit of 10 ppb, good selectivity, and humidity tolerance. This integration method could be extended to integrating other gas sensors.

Herein, by systematically varying the concentration of Na+ and OH- at the same absolute electrode potential, we demonstrate that higher concentrations of cations (Na+), rather than OH-, exert the main promotional effect on the production of C2+ products. The impact of the nature and the concentration of cations on the electrochemical reduction of CO is supported by experiments in which a fraction or all of Na+ is chelated by a crown ether. Chelation of Na+ leads to drastic decrease in the formation rate of C2+ products. The promotional effect of OH- determined at the same potential on the reversible hydrogen electrode scale is likely caused by larger overpotentials at higher electrolyte pH.

Constructing a pathway for mixed ion and electron transfer reactions for O-2 incorporation in Pr0.1Ce0.9O2-x	NATURE CATALYSIS			English	Article							X-RAY-ABSORPTION; OXYGEN INCORPORATION; CONDUCTING ELECTRODES; SURFACE EXCHANGE; AMBIENT-PRESSURE; CURRENT-DENSITY; SOFC CATHODE; OXIDE; PEROVSKITE; CERIA	In interfacial charge-transfer reactions, the complexity of the reaction pathway increases with the number of charges transferred, and becomes even greater when the reaction involves both electrons (charge) and ions (mass). These so-called mixed ion and electron transfer (MIET) reactions are crucial in intercalation/insertion electrochemistry, such as that occurring in oxygen reduction/evolution electrocatalysts and lithium-ion battery electrodes. Understanding MIET reaction pathways, particularly identifying the rate-determining step (RDS), is crucial for engineering interfaces at the molecular, electronic and point defect levels. Here we develop a generalizable experimental and analysis framework for constructing the reaction pathway for the incorporation of O-2(g) in Pr0.1Ce0.9O2-x. We converge on four candidates for the RDS (dissociation of neutral oxygen adsorbate) out of more than 100 possibilities by measuring the current density-overpotential curves while controlling both oxygen activity in the solid and oxygen gas partial pressure, and by quantifying the chemical and electrostatic driving forces using operando ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Identifying rate-determining steps (RDSs) is one of the most challenging aspects of catalysis. This work presents a general framework to identify the RDS of mixed ion and electron transfer reactions, and applies it to the four-electron/two-ion O-2 reduction in solid-oxide fuel cell cathodes, converging on four RDS out of more than 100 possible candidates.

Five of the newly synthesized complexes were structurally characterized, and the Ru-Cl bond lengths range from 2.477 to 2.544 angstrom while the Ru-Ru bond lengths range from 2.2838 to 2.2935 angstrom. The UV-vis spectra of each compound are characterized by three absorption bands in both H2O and DMSO, the intensity and position of which vary with both the type of bridging ligand and the solvent. The seven examined Ru-2(5+) complexes exist as 1:1 electrolytes in water, and each undergoes a reversible one-electron reduction assigned to Ru-2(5 +)/Ru-2(4 +) in both investigated solvents. A second irreversible reduction attributed to Ru-2(4+)/Ru-2(3+) is also observed for each compound at more negative potentials in DMSO. A linear free energy relationship exists between the sum of the Hammett substituent constants (Sigma sigma) on the ap-type bridging ligand and the wavenumber of an absorption band for the Ru-2(5+) complexes. A linear relationship is also seen between Sigma sigma and measured E-1/2 values for the Ru-2(5+)/Ru-2(4+) process in water containing 0.1 M KCl, but little to no effect is seen between the specific bridging ligand and the structural features of the investigated compounds.

The investigated anions were PF6-, BF4-, HSO4-, ClO4- , Br-, I-, Cl-, OAc-, F-, OTs-, and CN-, all but three of which were found to facilitate reduction of the cobalt corrole in dilute CH2Cl2 solutions, as determined by a combination of UV-vis spectroscopy and spectroelectrochemistry. The synthesized corroles are represented as (Ar)(3) CorCo(DMSO), where Ar is a meso-phenyl group containing one of 10 different electron- donating or -withdrawing substituents. The axial DMSO ligand was found to dissociate in dilute (10(-5) M) CH2Cl2 solutions, but this was not the case at the higher electrochemical concentration of 10(-3) M, where the investigated corroles exhibit a rich redox reactivity, undergoing up to five reversible one-electron-transfer reactions under the different solution conditions. The reversible half-wave potentials for generation of the singly oxidized corroles varied by over 1.0 V with a change in the electron-donating or -withdrawing meso-phenyl substituents and type of anion added to the solution, ranging from E-1/2 = 0.83 V in one extreme to -0.42 V in the other. Much smaller shifts in the potentials (on the order of similar to 210 mV) were observed for the reversible first reduction as a function of changes of the anion and/or corrole substituents, with the only exception being in the case of CN-, where the E-1/2 values in CH2Cl2 ranged from +0.08 V in solutions containing 0.1 M TBAClO(4) to >-1.8 V upon the addition of CN-.

We establish free energy diagrams for the NRR on the basal planes of 55 different M2XTx MXenes (M = Ti, V, Zr, Nb, Mo, Ta, W; X = C, N) to span a large variety of possible chemistries. Energy trends with respect to the metal as well as nonmetal constituent of the MXenes are established for both bare and functionalized MXenes. We determine the limiting potentials and find that either the formation of NH3 from *NH2 or the formation of *N2H is the potential limiting reaction step for bare and functionalized MXenes, respectively. We find several Mo-, W-, and V-based MXenes (Mo2C, Mo2N, W2N, W2NH2, and V2N) to have suitable theoretical overpotentials for the NRR. Importantly, calculated Pourbaix stability diagrams combined with selectivity analysis, however, reveal that all bare MXenes are not stable under relevant NRR operating conditions. The only functionalized MXene with the three minimum required properties (i) having a low theoretical overpotential, (ii) being stable under NRR conditions, and (iii) having selectivity toward NRR rather than the parasitic HER is W2CH2, which is a H-terminated MXene. Finally, on the basis of our findings, we explore other routes for improving the NRR chemistry by studying 10 additional MXenes with the chemical formula M3X2Tx and MXenes with other functional groups (T-x = S, F, Cl). This opens up a larger variety and tunability of MXenes to be considered for the NRR.

The electrochemical reduction and nucleation mechanism of copper and copper-zinc alloys were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. Cyclic voltammetry showed that copper species [Cu2ClO center dot urea](-) was reduced to copper at - 0.68 V (vs. Ag), while zinc species [ZnClO center dot urea](-) was reduced to zinc and formed copper-zinc alloy at - 1.8 V (vs. Ag). Chronoamperometry indicated that copper particles were electrodeposited by progressive nucleation with diffusion-controlled growth process in urea-BMIC-Cu2O solutions, and the average diffusion coefficient of copper complex ions was determined to be 2.79 x 10(-8) cm(2) s(-1). On contrast, the electrodeposition of copper-zinc alloy proceeded via combination of 3D instantaneous and progressive nucleation. On the other hand, copper and copper-zinc alloys were electroplated on to a stainless steel substrate and characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive spectroscopy.

Previous studies, however, have been largely limited to the study of slower or steady-state redox processes. In this work, we use electrochemiluminescence (ECL) to demonstrate the ability to optically record transient collision events of single platinum nanoparticles on a carbon ultramicroelectrode (UME). The electrocatalytic signal of a Pt nanoparticle on a cathodic pole of a bipolar electrode is coupled to the ECL signal on the anodic pole generating a transient optical signal. Correlated amperometric (i-t) and ECL (count-t) traces are then compared to determine critical parameters which influence the accurate temporal resolution of these rapid events. Our results suggest that ECL can be an effective means for spatially and temporally resolving transient redox processes when used on arrays of closed bipolar electrodes.

Microbiome for the Electrosynthesis of Chemicals from Carbon Dioxide	ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH			English	Review							FED-BATCH CULTIVATION; DOCOSAHEXAENOIC-ACID; CRYPTHECODINIUM-COHNII; NITROGENASE ACTIVITY; HYDROGEN; ACETATE; CO2; ELECTROLYSIS; REDUCTION; METABOLISM	CONSPECTUS: The price for renewable electricity is rapidly decreasing, and the availability of such energy is expected to increase in the coming years. This is a welcomed outcome considering that mitigation of climate disruption due to the use of fossil carbon is reaching a critical stage. However, the economy will remain dependent on carbon-based chemicals and the problem of electricity storage persists. Therefore, the development of electrosynthetic processes that convert electricity and CO2 into chemicals and energy dense fuels, perhaps even food, would be desirable. Electrochemistry has been applied to the manufacture of many valuable products and at a large industrial scale, but it is difficult to produce multicarbon chemicals from CO2 by chemistry alone. Being that the biological world possesses expertise at the construction of C-C bonds, it is being examined in conjunction with electrochemistry to discover new ways of synthesizing chemicals from electricity and CO2. One approach is microbial electrosynthesis. This Account describes the development of a microbial electrosynthesis system by the authors. A biocathode consisting of a carbon-based electrode and a microbial community produced short chain fatty acids, primarily acetate. The device works by electrolysis of water, but microbes facilitate electron transfer from the cathode while reducing CO2 by the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway possessed by an Acetobacterium sp. While this acetogenic microorganism dominates the microbiome growing on the cathode surface, 13 total species of microbes overall were ecologically selected on the cathode and genomes for each have been assembled. The combined species may contribute to the stability of the microbiome, a common feature of naturally selected microbial communities. The microbial electrosynthesis system was demonstrated to operate continuously at a cathode for more than 2 years and could also be used with intermittent power, thus demonstrating the stability of the microbiome living at the cathode. In addition to the description of reactor design and startup procedures, the possible mechanisms of electron transfer are described in this Account. While mysteries remain to be solved, much evidence indicates that the microbiome may facilitate electron transfer by supplying catalyst(s) external to the bacterial cells and onto the cathode surface. This may be in the form of a hydrogen-producing catalyst that enhances hydrogen generation by an inert carbon-based electrode. Through the enrichment of the electrosynthetic microbiome along with several modifications in reactor design and operation, the productivity and efficiency were improved. In addition to the intrinsic value of the current products, coupling the process with a secondary stage might be used to produce more valuable products from the acetic acid stream such as lipids, biocrude oil, or higher value food supplements. Alternatively, additional work on the mechanism of electron transfer, reactor design/operation, and modification of the microbes through synthetic biology, particularly to enhance carbon efficiency into higher value chemicals, are the needed next steps to advance microbial electrosynthesis so that it may be used to transform renewable electrons and CO2 directly into products and help solve the problem of climate disruption.

A Survival Guide for the "Electro-curious"	ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH			English	Review							C-H FUNCTIONALIZATION; CARBON BOND FORMATION; ANODIC-OXIDATION; ORGANIC ELECTROSYNTHESIS; COUPLING REACTIONS; REDUCTION; BATTERY; NICKEL; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; ELECTROREDUCTION	CONSPECTUS: The appeal and promise of synthetic organic electrochemistry have been appreciated over the past century. In terms of redox chemistry, which is frequently encountered when forging new bonds, it is difficult to conceive of a more economical way to add or remove electrons than electrochemistry. Indeed, many of the largest industrial synthetic chemical processes are achieved in a practical way using electrons as a reagent. Why then, after so many years of the documented benefits of electrochemistry, is it not more widely embraced by mainstream practitioners? Erroneous perceptions that electrochemistry is a "black box" combined with a lack of intuitive and inexpensive standardized equipment likely contributed to this stagnation in interest within the synthetic organic community. This barrier to entry is magnified by the fact that many redox processes can already be accomplished using simple chemical reagents even if they are less atom-economic. Time has proven that sustainability and economics are not strong enough driving forces for the adoption of electrochemical techniques within the broader community. Indeed, like many synthetic organic chemists that have dabbled in this age-old technique, our first foray into this area was not by choice but rather through sheer necessity. The unique reactivity benefits of this old redox-modulating technique must therefore be highlighted and leveraged in order to draw organic chemists into the field. Enabling new bonds to be forged with higher levels of chemo- and regioselectivity will likely accomplish this goal. In doing so, it is envisioned that widespread adoption of electrochemistry will go beyond supplanting unsustainable reagents in mundane redox reactions to the development of exciting reactivity paradigms that enable heretofore unimagined retrosynthetic pathways. Whereas the rigorous physical organic chemical principles of electroorganic synthesis have been reviewed elsewhere, it is often the case that such summaries leave out the pragmatic aspects of designing, optimizing, and scaling up preparative electrochemical reactions. Taken together, the task of setting up an electrochemical reaction, much less inventing a new one, can be vexing for even seasoned organic chemists. This Account therefore features a unique format that focuses on addressing this exact issue within the context of our own studies. The graphically rich presentation style pinpoints basic concepts, typical challenges, and key insights for those "electro-curious" chemists who seek to rapidly explore the power of electrochemistry in their research.

J	Jing, QW; Moeller, KD				Jing, Qiwei; Moeller, Kevin D.			From Molecules to Molecular Surfaces. Exploiting the Interplay Between Organic Synthesis and Electrochemistry	ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH			English	Review							BUILDING ADDRESSABLE LIBRARIES; ANODIC CYCLIZATION REACTIONS; OLEFIN COUPLING REACTIONS; MICROELECTRODE ARRAYS; OXIDATION; ELECTROSYNTHESIS; BINDING; STRATEGIES; ROUTE; RING	CONSPECTUS: For many years, we have been looking at electrochemistry as a tool for exploring, developing, and implementing new synthetic methods for the construction of organic molecules. Those efforts examined electrochemical methods and mechanisms and then exploited them for synthetic gain. Chief among the tools utilized was the fact that in a constant current electrolysis the working potential at the electrodes automatically adjusted to the oxidation (anode) or reduction (cathode) potential of the substrates in solution. This allowed for a systematic examination of the radical cation intermediates that are involved in a host of oxidative cyclization reactions. The result has been a series of structure-activity studies that have led to far greater insight into the behavior of radical cation intermediates and in turn an expansion in our capabilities of using those intermediates to trigger interesting synthetic reactions. With that said, the relationship between synthetic organic chemistry and electrochemistry is not a "one-way" interaction. For example, we have been using modern synthetic methodology to construct complex addressable molecular surfaces on electroanalytical devices that in turn can be used to probe biological interactions between small molecules and biological receptors in "real-time". Synthetic chemistry can then be used to recover the molecules that give rise to positive signals so that they can be characterized. The result is an analytical method that both gives accurate data on the interactions and provides a unique level of quality control with respect to the molecules giving rise to that data. Synthetic organic chemistry is essential to this task because it is our ability to synthesize the surfaces that defines the nature of the biological problems that can be studied. But the relationship between the fields does not end there. Recently, we have begun to show that work to expand the scope of microelectrode arrays as bioanalytical devices is teaching us important lessons for preparative synthetic chemistry. These lessons come in two forms. First, the arrays have taught us about the on-site generation of chemical reagents, a lesson that is being used to expand the use of paired electrochemical strategies for synthesis. Second, the arrays have taught us that reagents can be generated and then confined to the surface of the electrode used for that generation. This has led to a new approach to taking advantage of molecular recognition events that occur on the surface of an electrode for controlling' the selectivity of a preparative reaction. In short, the confinement strategy developed for the arrays is used to ensure that the chemistry in a preparative electrolysis happens at the electrode surface and not in the bulk solution. This Account details the interplay between synthetic chemistry and electrochemistry in our group through the years and highlights the opportunities that interplay has provided and will continue to provide in the future.

J	Zhang, S; Fan, Q; Xia, R; Meyer, TJ				Zhang, Sheng; Fan, Qun; Xia, Rong; Meyer, Thomas J.			CO2 Reduction: From Homogeneous to Heterogeneous Electrocatalysis	ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH			English	Review							CARBON-DIOXIDE; ELECTROCHEMICAL REDUCTION; FORMIC-ACID; ELECTROREDUCTION; COMPLEXES; FORMATE; SELECTIVITY; CONVERSION; WATER; RUTHENIUM	CONSPECTUS: Due to increasing worldwide fossil fuel consumption, carbon dioxide levels have increased in the atmosphere with increasingly important impacts on the environment. Renewable and clean sources of energy have been proposed, including wind and solar, but they are intermittent and require efficient and scalable energy storage technologies. Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) provides a valuable approach in this area. It combines solar- or wind-generated electrical production with energy storage in the chemical bonds of carbonbased fuels. It can provide ways to integrate carbon capture, utilization, and storage in energy cycles while maintaining controlled levels of atmospheric CO2. Electrochemistry allows for the utilization of an electrical input to drive chemical reactions. Because CO2 is kinetically inert, highly active catalysts are required to decrease reaction barriers sufficiently so that reaction rates can be achieved that are sufficient for electrochemical CO2 reduction. Given the reaction barriers associated with multiple electron-proton reduction of CO2 to CO, formaldehyde (HC(O)H), formic acid, or formate (HC(O)OH, HC(O)O-), or more highly reduced forms of carbon, there is also a demand for high selectivity in catalysis. Catalysts that have been explored include homogeneous catalysts in solution, catalysts immobilized on surfaces, and heterogeneous catalysts. In homogeneous catalysis, reduction occurs following diffusion of the catalyst to an electrode where multiple proton coupled electron transfer reduction occurs. Useful catalysts in this area are typically transition-metal complexes with organic ligands and electron transfer properties that utilize combinations of metal and ligand redox levels. As a way to limit the amount of catalyst, in device-like configurations, catalysts are added to the surfaces of conductive substrates by surface binding, in polymeric films, or on carbon electrode surfaces with molecular structures and electronic configurations related to catalysts in solution. Immobilized, homogeneous catalysts can suffer from performance losses and even decomposition during long-term CO2 reduction cycles, but they are amenable to detailed mechanistic investigations. In parallel efforts, heterogeneous nanocatalysts have been explored in detail with the development of facile synthetic procedures that can offer highly active catalytic surface areas. Their high activity and stability have attracted a significant level of investigation, including possible exploitation for large-scale applications. However, translation of catalytic reactivity to the surface creates a new reactivity environment and complicates the elucidation of mechanistic details and identification of the active site in exploring reaction pathways. Here, the results of previous studies based on transition-metal complex catalysts for CO2 electroreduction are summarized. Early studies showed that transition-metal complexes of Ru, Ir, Rh, and Os, with well-defined structures, are all capable of catalyzing CO2 reduction to CO or formate. Derivatives of the complexes were surface attached to conducting electrodes by chemical bonding, noncovalent bonding, or polymerization. The concept of surface binding has also been extended to the preparation of surface area electrodes by the chemically controlled deposition of nanostructured catalysts such as nano tin, nano copper, and nano carbon, all of which have been shown to have high selectivities and activities toward CO2 reduction. In our presentation, we end this Account with recent advances and a perspective about the application of electrocatalysis in carbon dioxide reduction.

Results from fracture mechanics-based experiments conducted at a constant stress-intensity range (Delta K) and load ratio (R) suggest that highly sensitized AA5456-H116 microstructures (ASTM G67 nitric acid mass loss tests [NAMLT] value of 24 mg/cm(2) and higher) exhibit increased da/dN over microstructures in the as-received condition (NAMLT 5 mg/cm(2)) and the onset of an inverse f-dependence. For a single, high level of sensitization (70 mg/cm(2)), da/dN increased 3.5x as f decreased from 10 Hz to 0.03 Hz. At a singular low loading f of 0.03 Hz, high sensitization levels (65 mg/cm(2)) accelerated da/dN fivefold over da/dN in the as-received condition. The da/dN of microstructures below a critical NAMLT value of 24 mg/cm(2) were f-independent. Specifically, in microstructures with a low sensitization level (ASTM G67 NAMLT value less than 24 mg/cm(2)), there was no increase in da/dN as f decreased from 1 Hz to 0.03 Hz. At any singular f, sensitization up to 24 mg/cm(2) did not accelerate da/dN over the rate in an as-received microstructure. Additional testing established that the inverse f-dependence of da/dN observed in highly sensitized microstructures cannot be attributed to crack length effects. Two hypotheses are discussed that may explain the observed inverse relationship between f and da/dN in microstructures at or above the critical NAMLT value of 24 mg/cm(2).	[Schrock, D. J.; Locke, J.

Electron Tunneling through Boron Nitride Confirms Marcus-Hush Theory Predictions for Ultramicroelectrodes	ACS NANO			English	Article						hBN; electron tunneling; electron transfer; Marcus-Hush theory; microelectrodes	ALKANETHIOL MONOLAYERS; TRANSFER KINETICS; FREE-ENERGY; GRAPHITE; GRAPHENE; STATES; TRANSPORT; DENSITY; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; DEPENDENCE	Marcus-Hush theory of electron transfer is one of the pillars of modern electrochemistry with a large body of supporting experimental evidence presented to date. However, some predictions, such as the electrochemical behavior at disk ultramicroelectrodes, remain unverified. Herein, we present a study of electron tunneling across a hexagonal boron nitride acting as a barrier between a graphite electrode and redox mediators in a liquid solution. This was achieved by the fabrication of disk ultramicroelectrodes with a typical diameter of 5 pm. Analysis of voltammetric measurements, using two common outer-sphere redox mediators, yielded several electrochemical parameters, including the electron transfer rate constant, limiting current, and transfer coefficient. They depart significantly from the Butler-Volmer kinetics and instead show behavior previously predicted by the Marcus-Hush theory of electron transfer. In addition, our system provides a noteworthy experimental platform, which could be applied to address a number of scientific problems such as identification of reaction mechanisms, surface modification, or long-range electron transfer.

Although both rely on electrochemical processes, their charge-storage mechanisms are dissimilar, giving rise to different energy and power densities. Pseudocapacitive materials store charge through battery-like redox reactions but at fast rates comparable to those of electrochemical double-layer capacitors; these materials, therefore, offer a pathway for achieving both high energy and high power densities. Materials that combine these properties are in demand for the realization of fast-charging electrochemical energy-storage devices capable of delivering high power for long periods of time. In this Review, we describe the fundamental electrochemical properties of pseudocapacitive materials, with emphasis on kinetic processes and distinctions between battery and pseudocapacitive materials. In addition, we discuss the various types of pseudocapacitive materials, highlighting the differences between intrinsic and extrinsic materials; assess device applications; and consider the future prospects for the field. Pseudocapacitive materials can bridge the gap between high-energy-density battery materials and high-power-density electrochemical capacitor materials. In this Review, we examine the electrochemistry and physical signatures of pseudocapacitive charge-storage processes and discuss existing pseudocapacitive materials.

Electrochemical Modulation of Strong Vibration-Cavity Coupling	ACS PHOTONICS			English	Article						light-matter strong coupling QED; polariton; electrochemistry; vibrations; optical cavities; vibrational strong coupling	HETEROGENEOUS ELECTRON-EXCHANGE; APROTIC-SOLVENTS; PARA-BENZOQUINONE; QUINONES; METAMATERIALS; CONDENSATION; DEPENDENCE	Modulation of strong coupling has implications for on-demand reactivity, optical modulation devices, and greater understanding of molecule-cavity coupling effects. Here, we electrochemically switch the redox couple benzoquinone/dihydroquinone (BQ/dHQ) within an optical cavity. We find that the BQ carbonyl species can be reduced, under appropriate biases, resulting in the complete elimination of the Rabi splitting, which is the signature of strong coupling. We achieve optical signal modulation of similar to 100% at frequencies near the fundamental BQ carbonyl absorption as well as the polariton bands, and we experimentally evaluate the switching rate of such systems, finding that repeated cycling degrades performance, likely due to compositional changes in the electrochemical medium during the electrochemical reactions. Cavity resonances shift in correlation with the change of the solvent dielectric constant during electrochemical cycling. Although this consequent detuning influences the magnitude of optical modulation at the fundamental BQ resonance frequency, it makes optical modulation possible at many frequencies simultaneously since cavity fringe position scales with the refractive index. These results expand the understanding and utility of strong vibrational-cavity coupling and may lead to demonstrations of modified electrochemical response for technologically relevant material systems.

These systems are governed by intimate coupling between fluid flow, mass transport, and electrostatic effects. When counterions are driven toward a selective interface, this coupling is shown to lead to a hydrodynamic instability called electroconvection. This phenomenon is an example of electrochemistry inducing flow, which in turn affects the transport and ohmic resistance of the bulk electrolyte. These effects have implications in a wide range of applications, including ion separation, electrodeposition, and microfluidic processes that incorporate ion-selective elements. This review surveys recent investigations of electroconvection with an emphasis on quantitative experimental and theoretical analyses and computational modeling of this phenomenon. Approaches for control and manipulation of this phenomenon in canonical settings are also discussed.

Current systems for neurochemical monitoring are bulky or expensive, limiting widespread exploration of this research field and preventing large-scale parallel experimentation. In this paper, we present a new miniaturized research platform, the TinyFSCV system, which can be used to monitor dynamic changes in neurochemicals through Fast-Scan Cyclic Voltammetry (FSCV). This system contains a precision voltage output circuit that can accurately output potentials between-0.55 to 2 V and scan a connected electrochemical cell at up to 400 V/s, the required speed to sense most neurochemicals with FSCV. In addition, the device includes precision current measurement circuity with a measurement range of -115 to 115 mu A capable of taking measurements at up to 56 KS/s. Four experiments are conducted to demonstrate the capability of the system. These consisted of: static bench tests, static ferrocene tests, and static and dynamic dopamine tests. These experiments demonstrate the ability of the miniaturized platform to accurately sense and measure neurochemicals. Ultimately, the TinyFSCV system is a platform that can enable large-scale, low-cost parallel experimentation to take place in the field of neurochemical monitoring. In addition, this device will increase the accessibility of neurochemical sensing, providing advanced tools and techniques to more researchers, and facilitating widespread exploration of the field of neurodynamics.

Our results show that bisulfate, as well as hydronium-sulfate ion pairs, can be adsorbed on Pt(110) at electrode potentials below 0.4 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). On the other hand, only bisulfate is stable on Pt(100) at potentials below 0.6 V (RHE). At a higher potential, the results indicate that only sulfate is stable on these surfaces. The sulfuric acid anions are two-fold coordinated on Pt(110) and Pt(100), which contrasts with the Pt(111) surface where the adsorbed conformation of the anions can change from a two-fold to three-fold coordination. These differences in the coordination of the adsorbed sulfuric acid anions on Pt(111), Pt(110), and Pt(100) could help rationalize the dissimilar voltammetric features of these surfaces in sulfuric acid solutions.

Electronic absorption spectra, electrochemical studies, a single-crystal X-ray structure, and DFT calculations all suggest that the ground states of the new complexes indeed correspond to an innocent Au-III-DPP3-, paralleling a similar description noted for Au corroles. Interestingly, while DFT calculations indicate purely ligand-centered oxidations, reduction of AuDPP is predicted to occur across both the metal and the ligand.

Assessing contaminants from ion-exchange membranes in the evaluation of aqueous electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction	JOURNAL OF CO2 UTILIZATION			English	Article						CO2 reduction; Catalysis; Electrochemistry; Ion-exchange membranes	CO2 REDUCTION; ELECTROREDUCTION; CATALYSIS; POLYMERS; INSIGHTS; MONOXIDE; FUEL; ACID; CELL; GHB	In the search for new value-added products from CO2 electroreduction, it is critical that the detected species is derived from conversion of the reactants. Here we characterize contaminants from common ionomer anion- and cation-exchange membranes and demonstrate for one case how this can lead to misinterpretation of the product species by NMR spectroscopy. In particular, the membrane casting solvent N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) is demonstrated to be interpretable by NMR as other possible four-carbon products of the CO2 electroreduction. While the recommended commercial membrane pretreatment procedures greatly reduced the contaminant concentrations, this was not sufficient for all membrane types.

While most of these demonstrations have involved the use of 3D-printing to fabricate structural components of electrochemical devices, this manuscript describes the design, manufacture and performance of 3D-printed porous flow-through electrodes employed in an electrolyzer that is itself made almost entirely by 3D-printing. These electrodes were 3D-printed using fused deposition modeling (FDM) from a composite of conductive carbon and polylactic acid (PLA), followed by electrodeposition of nickel (Ni) electrocatalyst. The stability and performance of these Ni-PLA electrodes were evaluated for water electrolysis in 1.0 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH). After characterizing the performance of a single electrode pair for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), three pairs of electrodes were incorporated into a simple and scalable 3D-printed membraneless electrolyzer by "clicking" them into a monolithic lid containing manifolding for collection of the O-2 and H-2 product gases. The device utilizes a membraneless architecture capable of operating in a stagnant electrolyte through buoyancy-driven separation of product gases, and allowing for easy regeneration of electrodes by electrodeposition. Device operation was evaluated through a combination of electroanalytical measurements, in situ high-speed video imaging, and finite element modeling. Although the efficiency and cross-over rates of these membraneless electrolyzers fall below what is required for commercial applications, additive manufacturing of electrodes offers an exciting new design space to improve performance and enable robust operation for applications where membrane-based electrolyzers are inherently unstable.

J	Dhiman, P; Huang, HYS				Dhiman, Pankaj; Huang, Hsiao-Ying Shadow			Dislocation based stresses during electrochemical cycling and phase transformation in lithium-ion batteries	COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article						Lithium-ion battery; Dislocations; Stresses; Cyclic voltammatery		Lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) contains defects that play an important role in structural degradation of batteries. Linear defects called dislocations are introduced inside the lithium ion battery material during fabrication process accompanied by distortion produced stress fields around them. The present study deals with these mechanical stresses around dislocations in lithium iron phosphate and the change in stress field during phase transformation of lithium iron phosphate electrode material. A model consisting of multiple dislocations inside a lithium iron phosphate material incorporating anisotropic material properties is used to calculate stress fields using linear elastic theory and the superposition method. The stress fields around dislocations during phase transformation of lithium-iron phosphate are numerically calculated by incorporating the anisotropic properties of the material. The change in electrochemical behaviour of material due to change in stress field during phase transformation is also studied, where a modified electrochemical kinetics equation (i.e., Butler Volmer equation) is derived and used to account for dislocation induced stresses during the reversible cyclic voltammatery of the lithium iron phosphate. The results shows the stress inside material does not remain constant during phase transformation and its variations are dislocation orientation dependent. In addition, the result shows that the presence of stress fields around dislocations changes the electrochemical behaviour of the material as suggested by the shift in the cyclic voltammograms. The effect of increasing scan rate on cyclic voltammogram is also studied for lithium iron phosphate. The results show that the increase in current at peaks is independent of the orientation of dislocations studied. Moreover, the decrease in current corresponding to a particular overvoltage value before anodic peak and increase in current after the anodic peak is found to be somehow proportional to the scan rate. Increased scan rates show increased deviation of current from a cyclic voltammogram for material in which there is no phase transformation. The results provide an insight into how presence of defects and phase transformation changes the electrochemical behaviour of the material. It is concluded that the combined effect of the stresses induced around dislocations during phase transformation and high scan rate can be used for modifying battery materials for various applications by changing electrochemistry of electrodes. The present study incorporates electrochemistry, defects and phase transformation into one battery chemistry and thus is important in our understanding of the Li-ion batteries.

Here, it is demonstrated that a tailored current collector will stabilize the metal plating-stripping behavior even with a conventional KPF6-carbonate electrolyte. A 3D copper current collector is functionalized with partially reduced graphene oxide to create a potassiophilic surface, the electrode being denoted as rGO@3D-Cu. Potassiophilic versus potassiophobic experiments demonstrate that molten K fully wets rGO@3D-Cu after 6 s, but does not wet unfunctionalized 3D-Cu. Electrochemically, a unique synergy is achieved that is driven by interfacial tension and geometry: the adherent rGO underlayer promotes 2D layer-by-layer (Frank-van der Merwe) metal film growth at early stages of plating, while the tortuous 3D-Cu electrode reduces the current density and geometrically frustrates dendrites. The rGO@3D-Cu symmetric cells and half-cells achieve state-of-the-art plating and stripping performance. The symmetric rGO@3D-Cu cells exhibit stable cycling at 0.1-2 mA cm(-2), while baseline Cu prematurely fails when the current reaches 0.5 mA cm(-2). The half-cells cells of rGO@3D-Cu (no K reservoir) are stable at 0.5 mA cm(-2) for 10 000 min (100 cycles), and at 1 mA cm(-2) for 5000 min. The baseline 3D-Cu, planar rGO@Cu, and planar Cu foil fails after 5110, 3012, and 1410 min, respectively.

Such a development has been facilitated by electrochemistry's unparalleled ability to achieve highly specific molecular measurements in complex biological fluids, without the need for expensive instrumentation. However, for decades, progress in the field had been constrained to systems that depended on the chemical reactivity of the analyte, obstructing the generalizability of such platforms beyond redox- or enzymatically active clinical targets. Thus, the pursuit of alternative, more general strategies, coupled to the timely technological advances in DNA sequencing, led to the development of DNA-based electrochemical sensors. The analytical value of these arises from the structural customizability of DNA and its ability to bind analytes ranging from ions and small molecules to whole proteins and cells. This versatility extends to interrogation methods, as DNA-based sensors work through a variety of detection schemes that can be probed via many electroanalytical techniques. As a reference for those experienced in the field, and to guide the unexperienced scientist, here we review the specific advantages of the electroanalytical methods most commonly used for the interrogation of DNA-based sensors.

The advent of high capacity cathode materials necessitates a clear understanding of the associated reaction kinetics at elevated temperatures. Here, we present a comprehensive thermo-electrochemical analytics approach to study simulated calorimetric experiments and kinetic parameters estimation for understanding material specific thermal stability. In particular, the focus of the present study is on the fundamental understanding of the thermal stability of disparate cathode materials for lithium-ion intercalation chemistry. Unfortunately, stability of high-capacity cathode materials at elevated temperatures is often challenged by undesirable side reactions including oxygen evolution that promotes electrolyte combustion. The electrochemistry coupled thermo-kinetic strategy presented here acknowledges the multiple abuse reactions associated with the cathode active material and electrolyte interaction at elevated temperatures, which is elucidated via thermal runaway potential based on simulated oven test signatures. The proposed thermo-electrochemical analytics could prove decisive in deconvolving the innate thermal instability signatures of electrode electrolyte pairs in Li-ion battery chemistry.

Polarizability of the Active Site in Enzymatic Catalysis: Cytochrome c	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B			English	Article							RANGE ELECTRON-TRANSFER; REORGANIZATION ENERGIES; TUNNELING PATHWAYS; PROTEIN DYNAMICS; SOLVENT; REDUCTION; WATER; AZURIN; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; ENERGETICS	Anisotropic polarizability of the heme in cytochrome c is found to be a major factor in suppressing the activation barrier of protein electron transfer (catalytic effect). Polarizability couples to the electric field of protein and water to enhance fluctuations of the electron-transfer energy gap and the corresponding variance reorganization energy lambda(var). The reorganization energy observable by kinetic measurements lambda(r) = (lambda(St))(2)/lambda(var) is composed of lambda(var) and the Stokes-shift reorganization energy lambda(St). It is lowered compared to the usually reported lambda(St) due to polarizability of the active site leading to lambda(var) > lambda(St). The coupling of electrostatic protein-water fluctuations to the polarizable active site is accounted for here by empirical valence-bond diagonalization of the active-site Hamiltonian along the simulation trajectory. We show that recent simulations employing this technique, which failed to find the effect of polarizability on electron-transfer kinetics, were erroneous in neglecting the diagonal dipole moments in the Hamiltonian matrix and failing to rotate the electric field produced by the protein-water medium into the molecular frame of the active site. We find that anisotropy of the tensor of polarizability difference in the two oxidation states of the heme matches anisotropy of the second-rank tensor constructed from the electric field at the active site. Exposure of the heme to water from only one side carries significant catalytic function, directly leading to the field anisotropy and the corresponding depression of the activation barrier.

Prior theoretical studies have proposed the possible benefit of defective 2 D MoS2 materials as polysulfide trapping agents. Herein the synthesis and thorough characterization of hydrothermally prepared MoS2 nanosheets that vary in layer number, morphology, lateral size, and defect content are reported. The materials were incorporated into composite sulfur-based cathodes and studied in Li-S batteries with environmentally benign ether-based electrolytes. Through directed synthesis of the MoS2 additive, the relationship between synthetically induced defects in 2 D MoS2 materials and resultant electrochemistry was elucidated and described.

Anode Overpotential Control via Interfacial Modification: Inhibition of Lithium Plating on Graphite Anodes	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						lithium plating; lithium-ion battery; fast charging; interfacial modification; graphite anode	SOLID-ELECTROLYTE INTERPHASE; OPTICAL-EMISSION SPECTROSCOPY; SURFACE-FILM FORMATION; LI-ION BATTERY; NICKEL METAL; COPPER; QUANTIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; DEPOSITION; MORPHOLOGY	Lithium-metal deposition on graphite anodes limits the cycle life and negatively impacts safety of the current state of the art Li-ion batteries. Herein, deliberate interfacial modification of graphite electrodes via direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering of nanoscale layers of Cu and Ni is employed to increase the overpotential for Li deposition and suppress Li plating under high rate charge conditions. Due to their nanoscale, the deposited surface films have minimal impact (similar to 0.16% decrease) on cell level theoretical energy density. Interfacial properties of the anodes are thoroughly characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and spatially resolved mapping X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. The spectroscopic measurements indicate that the Cu and Ni coatings form oxide upon exposure to an ambient environment, but they are reduced within the electrochemical cell and remain in a metallic state. Li plating is quantified by X-ray diffraction and associated electrochemistry measurements revealing that the surface treatment effectively reduces the quantity of the plated Li metal by similar to 50% compared to untreated electrodes. These results establish an effective method using interfacial modification to achieve deliberate control of Li-metal deposition overpotential and reduction of lithium plating on graphite.

Recent advances have focused on controlling and tailoring interfacial effects on the morphology and molecular structure of the active film in multilayer devices triggering new developments in the area of interface engineering. Here, we demonstrate that an inorganic electrode/organic semiconductor interface modification using PEDOT:PSS as an interfacial material influences the charge and ion transport, capacitive, morphological, and color switching properties of a solution processed purple-to-clear switching electrochromic PProDOT-(CH(2)OEtHx)(2) polymer film. We find that the barrier to charge transport from electrode to active material is lowered when adding this PEDOT:PSS film, allowing us to present a fully roll-to-roll compatible, simple, and versatile battery-type electrochromic device (ECD) design without the need for oxidizing the charge storage film, in combination with improved processing reproducibility. In addition to producing ECDs with minimal color differences compared to devices prepared in the more traditional and complicated manner, this new ECD design strategy provides competitive performance showing a consistent optical contrast of 50-55% and switching times of 2-4 s.

This material, named MB@UiO-66-NH2, can be synthesized by encapsulating methylene blue (MB) with a well-known metal-organic framework (MOF) UiO-66-NH2 through a simple impregnation method. The fluorescence intensity of the system was significantly enhanced when a certain amount of nicotine was added. In the meanwhile, MB is reduced by reductive nicotine to form leucomethylene blue (LB). The proposed sensor displayed excellent selectivity and sensitivity toward nicotine with limit of detection (LOD) of 0.98 mu M, which is comparable or even better than that of the electrochemistry detecting methods for nicotine. The obvious enhancement and blue shift of the emission arise from the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from LB to the UiO-66-NH2. The photophysical properties and the sensing applications of MB@UiO-66-NH2 suggest that this composite can be acted as a sensitive, selective, recyclable, and fluorogenic sensor for nicotine determination in urine solution and living cell.

Nonfaradaic Current Suppression in DNA-Based Electrochemical Assays with a Differential Potentiostat	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							APTAMER-BASED SENSORS; EMPLOYS STERIC HINDRANCE; BACKGROUND SUBTRACTION; MOLECULAR MEASUREMENTS; PERFORMANCE; BIOSENSORS; SIGNAL; QUANTITATION	One of the key factors limiting sensitivity in many electrochemical assays is the nonfaradaic or capacitive current. This is particularly true in modern assay systems based on DNA monolayers at gold electrode surfaces, which have shown great promise for bioanalysis in complex milieu such as whole blood or serum. While various changes in analytical parameters, redox reporter molecules, DNA structures, probe coverage, and electrode surface area have been shown useful, background reduction by hardware subtraction has not yet been explored for these assays. Here, we introduce new electrochemistry hardware that considerably suppresses nonfaradaic currents through real-time analog subtraction during current-to-voltage conversion in the potentiostat. This differential potentiostat (DiffStat) configuration is shown to suppress or remove capacitance currents in chronoamperometry, cyclic voltammetry, and square-wave voltammetry measurements applied to nucleic acid hybridization assays at the electrode surface. The DiffStat makes larger electrodes and higher sensitivity settings accessible to the user, providing order-of-magnitude improvements in sensitivity, and it also significantly simplifies data processing to extract faradaic currents in square-wave voltammetry (SWV). Because two working electrodes are used for differential measurements, unique arrangements are introduced such as converting signal-OFF assays to signal-ON assays or background drift correction in 50% human serum. Overall, this new potentiostat design should be helpful not only in improving the sensitivity of most electrochemical assays, but it should also better support adaptation of assays to the point-of-care by circumventing complex data processing.

By screening silver-catalyzed GDEs over a range of applied current densities, an inverse correlation was observed between carbon monoxide selectivity and the electrochemical double-layer capacitance, a proxy for wetted electrode area. Plotting current-dependent performance as a function of cumulative charge led to data collapse onto a single sigmoidal curve indicating that the passage of faradaic current accelerates flooding. It was hypothesized that high cathode alkalinity, driven by both initial electrolyte conditions and cathode half-reactions, promotes carbonate formation and precipitation which, in turn, facilitates electrolyte permeation. This mechanism was reinforced by the observations that post-test GDEs retain less hydrophobicity than pristine materials and that water-rinsing and drying electrodes temporarily recovers peak selectivity. This knowledge offers an opportunity to design electrodes with greater carbonation tolerance to improve device longevity.

PdFe NSs showed superior catalytic activity towards the oxidation of nitrite due to the large surface area of 2 dimensional (2D) nanostructure and the synergetic effect between Pd and Fe. A sensitive and selective electrochemical nitrite sensing platform was designed base on PdFe NSs and the amperometric technique. The limit of detection (LOD) was found to be 0.12 mu M (S/N=3), with a linear relationship between nitrite concentration and response current in the range of 1-160 mu M.

However, their practical application is still restricted by rapid capacity fading resulting from the inferior electrode kinetics, low utilization of Se and enormous volumetric expansion. Herein, a jacicfruit-like electrode is designed for advanced Na-Se batteries to solve these problems. The carbon nanorods are well-aligned to form a jackfruit-like design as the Se host. Thanks to the unique structure, many hollow nanochannels between nanorods are able to provide multifold pathways for Na-ions diffusion and electrolyte penetration. Moreover, the nanopores in carbon nanorods can provide adequate space to store Se and to buffer volumetric expansion during cycling. More importantly, the well-aligned carbon nanorods can enable a fast electron transfer to improve the utilization of Se. As a result, the jackfruit-like Se-carbon electrodes exhibit a high capacity of 616 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, outstanding rate capability and long cycling life up to 600 cycles at 2 C with a very low capacity decay of 0.066% per cycle.

Direct Evidence of Local pH Change and the Role of Alkali Cation during CO2 Electroreduction in Aqueous Media	ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION			English	Article						analytical methods; carbon dioxide fixation; electrochemistry; local pH measurement; rotating ring-disc electrode	ELECTROCHEMICAL REDUCTION; METAL-ELECTRODES; CARBON-DIOXIDE; INTERFACIAL PH; SELECTIVITY; ELECTROOXIDATION	We report, for the first time, utilizing a rotating ring-disc electrode (RRDE) assembly for detecting changes in the local pH during aqueous CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Using Au as a model catalyst where CO is the only product, we show that the CO oxidation peak shifts by -86 +/- 2 mV/pH during CO2RR, which can be used to directly quantify the change in the local pH near the catalyst surface during electrolysis. We then applied this methodology to investigate the role of cations in affecting the local pH during CO2RR and find that during CO2RR to CO on Au in an MHCO3 buffer (where M is an alkali metal), the experimentally measured local basicity decreased in the order Li+ > Na+ > K+ > Cs+, which agreed with an earlier theoretical prediction by Singh et al. Our results also reveal that the formation of CO is independent of the cation. In summary, RRDE is a versatile tool for detecting local pH change over a diverse range of CO2RR catalysts. Additionally, using the product itself (i.e. CO) as the local pH probe allows us to investigate CO2RR without the interference of additional probe molecules introduced to the system. Most importantly, considering that most CO2RR products have pH-dependent oxidation, RRDE can be a powerful tool for determining the local pH and correlating the local pH to reaction selectivity.

Three examples of enantioselective chemistry resulting from electron-spin polarization are presented. One demonstrates the enantioselective association of a chiral molecule with an achiral self-assembled monolayer film that is spin-polarized, while the other two show that the chiral bias provided by the electron helicity can drive both reduction and oxidation in enantiospecific electrochemical reactions. In each case, the enantioselectivity does not result from enantiospecific interactions of the molecule with the ferromagnetic electrode but from the polarized spin that crosses the interface between the substrate and the molecule. Furthermore, the direction of the electron-spin polarization defines the handedness of the enantioselectivity. This work demonstrates a new mechanism for realizing enantioselective chemistry.

J	Houchins, G; Viswanathan, V				Houchins, Gregory; Viswanathan, Venkatasubramanian			Towards Ultra Low Cobalt Cathodes: A High Fidelity Computational Phase Search of Layered Li-Ni-Mn-Co Oxides	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						Thermodynamics; cluster expansion; NMC; uncertainty quantification	DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL THEORY; UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION; ERROR ESTIMATION; LOCAL-STRUCTURE; LITHIUM; CHEMISTRY; NMR; LICO1/3NI1/3MN1/3O2; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; STABILITY	Layered Li(Ni,Mn,Co,)O-2 (NMC) presents an intriguing ternary alloy design space for optimization as a cathode material in Li-ion batteries. In the case of NMC, however, only a select few proportions of transition metal cations have been attempted and even fewer have been adopted on a large scale. Recently, the high cost and resource limitations of Co have added a new design constraint and high Ni-containing NMC alloys have gained enormous attention despite possible performance trade-offs. Although the limited collection of NMC cathodes have been successful in providing the performance needed for many applications, specifically electric vehicles, this concern around Co requires further advancement and optimization within the NMC design space. Additionally, it is not fully understood if this material space is a disordered solid solution at room temperature and any arbitrary combination can be used or if there exist distinct transition metal orderings to which meta-stable solid solutions will decay during cycling and affect performance. Here, we present a high fidelity computational search of the ternary phase diagram with an emphasis on high-Ni, and thus low Co, containing compositional phases to understand the room temperature stability of the ordered and disordered solid solution phases. This is done through the use of density functional theory training data fed into a reduced order model Hamiltonian that accounts for effective electronic and spin interactions of neighboring transition metal atoms at various lengths in a background of fixed composition and position lithium and oxygen atoms. This model can then be solved to include finite temperature thermodynamics into a convex hull analysis to understand the regions of ordered and disordered solid solution as well the transition metal orderings within the ordered region of the phase diagram. We also provide a method to propagate the uncertainty at every level of the analysis to the final prediction of thermodynamically favorable compositional phases thus providing a quantitative measure of confidence for each prediction made. Due to the complexity of the three component system, as well as the intrinsic error of density functional theory, we argue that this propagation of uncertainty, particularly the uncertainty due to exchange-correlation functional choice is necessary to have reliable and interpretable results. We find that for the majority of transition metal compositions of the layered material, specifically medium to high-Ni content, prefer transition metal ordering and predict the collection of preferred compositions in the ordered region.

His scientific works have been devoted to the concepts and technologies of today's batteries, in particular, mastering research on electrodes and electrolytes. With respect to innovative discoveries, Michel had several scientific breakthroughs from the description of the solid-solution electrode and rocking-chair battery to the applications of novel materials utilized in all-solid-state batteries (SSBs); these refer to Li-ion, Na-ion, Li-S, and Li-air cells. At a young age, he formalized the concept of electrochemical intercalation and fabricated the first SSB with sodium-intercalated graphite as the electrode in 1972. Subsequently, he led the use of solid polymer electrolytes and developed lithium-metal-polymer batteries with vanadium oxide as the cathode in 1978. Michel successfully conducted research in new salts topics based on delocalized anions of the sulfonimide family in 1986; his research areas included 1) organic electrode materials, i.e., innovations in redox-active organics, which included poly quinones and aromatic dicarboxylates, and 2) carbon "nano painting" process that has made LiFePO4@C the safest cathode in 2002. Because Michel has co-authored over 500 publications and many patents, it is impractical to fully review his outstanding contributions in electrochemistry in this work. This work is limited to a few of his contributions pertaining to the evolution of electrochemical energy storage. We further discussed different routes envisioned for further progress in rechargeable batteries. (C) The Author(s) 2019. Published by ECS.

This extracellular electron transfer process, which allows microorganisms to gain energy by respiring solid redox-active minerals, also facilitates the wiring of cells to electrodes. While recent studies have suggested that a chiral indexed spin selectivity effect is linked to efficient electron transmission through biomolecules, this phenomenon has not been investigated in extracellular electron conduits. Using magnetic conductive probe atomic force microscopy, Hall voltage measurements, and spin-dependent electrochemistry of the decaheme cytochromes MtrF and OmcA from the metal-reducing bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, we show that electron transport through these extracellular conduits is spin-selective. Our study has implications for understanding how spin-dependent interactions and magnetic fields may control electron transport across biotic-abiotic interfaces in both natural and biotechnological systems.

The electrodes were prepared from soluble precursors by anodic electrodeposition of two sizes of graphene quantum dot assemblies (hexabenzocoronene (HBC) and carbon quantum dot (CQD)) onto a conductive support. Experimental and simulated voltammograms enabled the extraction of the following electrode parameters: conductivity of the electrodes (a combination of ionic and electronic contributions), density of available electrode states at different potentials, and tunneling rate constant (Marcus Gerischer model) for interfacial charge transfer to ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc(+)) couple. The parameters indicate that HBC and CQD have significant density of electronic states at potentials more positive than -0.5 V versus Ag/Ag+ Enabled by these large densities, the electron transfer rates at the Fc/Fc(+) thermodynamic potential are several orders of magnitude slower than those commonly observed on other carbon electrodes. This study is expected to accelerate the discovery of improved synthetic carbon electrodes by providing fast screening methodology of their electrochemical behavior.

With the hierarchical distribution of Mg/Ti dual dopants in LiNiO2, we report a Co-free layered oxide that exhibits enhanced bulk and surface stability. Ti shows a gradient distribution and is enriched at the surface, whereas Mg distributes homogeneously throughout the primary particles. The resulting Mg/Ti codoped LiNiO2 delivers a material-level specific energy of similar to 780 W h/kg at C/10 with 96% retention after 50 cycles. The specific energy reaches similar to 680 W h/kg at 1C with 77% retention after 300 cycles. Furthermore, the Mg/Ti dual dopants improve the rate capability, thermal stability, and self-discharge resistance of LiNiO2. Our synchrotron X-ray, electron, and electrochemical diagnostics reveal that the Mg/Ti dual dopants mitigate phase transformations, reduce nickel dissolution, and stabilize the cathode-electrolyte interface, thus leading to the favorable battery performance in lithium metal and graphite cells. The present study suggests that engineering the dopant distribution in cathodes may provide an effective path toward lower cost, safer, and higher energy density Co-free lithium batteries.

Platinum remains a leading choice of catalyst, but because of its high cost and low natural abundance, it is critical to optimize its use. In the present study, platinum oxide nanoparticles of approximately 2 nm in diameter are deposited on carbon nitride (C3N4) nanosheets by thermal refluxing of C3N4 and PtCl2 or PtCl4 in water. These nanoparticles exhibit apparent electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acid. Interestingly, the HER activity increases with increasing Pt4+ concentration in the nanoparticles, and the optimized catalyst even outperforms commercial Pt/C, exhibiting an overpotential of only -7.7 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of -26.3 mV dec(-1). The results from this study suggest that the future design of platinum oxide catalysts should strive to maximize the Pt4+ sites and minimize the formation of the less active Pt2+ species.

In this work, we have measured the conductance of pyridiniums axial ligands at the single molecule level using the scanning tunneling microscope-based break-junction method (STM-Break Junction) to study the role of the axial ligand on the activity of the self-assembled FePc systems on a gold electrode surface. The electron-pulling effect of pyridinium axial ligands is known to increase the electrocatalytic activity of FePc for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). We have used these systems as a platform for carrying out a comparative study for understanding the real influence of the proximal axial ligands. Further, these ligands act as molecular wires between the gold electrode surface and the FePc molecule. The pyridinium molecules were synthesized following a series of structural variations using a basic molecular backbone. From conductance measurements obtained for each pyridinium molecule, it was possible to establish that electron transport through each pyridinium does not influence the activity of FePc for ORR in alkaline media. In addition, the DFT calculations shows that the axial ligand in FePc modifies its catalytic activity by decreasing the binding energy of O-2 to the Fe site. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we discussed the effects of having primary amine linkers with different carbon chain lengths as a medium to attach anthraquinone (AQ) at the electrode surface to study its acid dissociation constant (pKa); anthraquinone was covalently attached to glassy carbon (GC) electrodes in aqueous buffer solutions at different pH values ranging from pH 1 to pH 13. In this study, ethylenediamine (EDA, C2) and hexanediamine (HDA, C6) were used as the primary amine linkers. The pKa values of the surface-bound AQ were determined from the linear and non-linear fittings performed on the graphs of the mid potential (E-mid) of the redox peaks for AQ against the pH. The pKa values obtained from the linear fittings were using the value at the intersection point of two linear slopes between two pH gradients, whilst the pKa values for the non-linear fittings were determined according to the Nernst pH reduction theory. Overall, the non-linear fittings can provide us with a reliable and accurate approach in determining the pKa values of AQ. (C) The Author(s) 2019. Published by ECS.

J	Wilson, AJ; Mohan, V; Jain, PK				Wilson, Andrew J.; Mohan, Varun; Jain, Prashant K.			Mechanistic Understanding of Plasmon-Enhanced Electrochemistry	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							CARBON-DIOXIDE REDUCTION; HYDROGEN EVOLUTION; METAL NANOPARTICLES; RELAXATION DYNAMICS; GOLD NANOPARTICLES; ELECTRON-TRANSFER; OXYGEN REDUCTION; OXIDATION; SELECTIVITY; ELECTROCATALYSTS	Noble metals are prime candidates for electrocatalysts for electrochemical energy conversions. In a separate realm, nanostructured noble metals are found to exhibit photocatalytic activity under plasmonic excitation with no electrical bias. Here, we explore the convergence of the electrocatalytic and photocatalytic activity of nanostructured noble metals in electrochemical reactions performed under plasmonic excitation. We use as a model the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on Au nanoparticle (NP) electrocatalysts. We observe that plasmonic excitation of the Au NP electrocatalyst enhances the HER activity. We trace the mechanistic origin of this plasmonic enhancement by using a combination of electrochemical techniques. Specifically, we resolve the contribution of hot carriers from that of heat generated by plasmonic excitation in the observed enhancement. Although photothermal heating plays a minimal role, hot electrons generated by plasmon excitation result in cathodic photocharging of the Au NP electrode, which enhances interfacial electrontransfer kinetics and manifests in a reduced overpotential. The higher the light intensity, the greater is the decrease in the overpotential, that is, the activation barrier. The photopotential resulting from plasmonic excitation exclusively enhances the Faradaic reaction without an increase in the double-layer charging. In summary, this article provides a unified model of the influence of plasmonic excitation on an electrochemical reaction.

This study for the first time investigated the different electrochemical behaviors of the two-dimensional cross-section and cylindrical surfaces of a CF. Two specially designed carbon fiber electrodes (CFE) were used to understand the carbon fiber electrochemical performance in a 3.5 wt% NaCl solution. The results show that the CF is two-dimensional anisotropic in electrochemistry, and the cross-section is two orders of magnitude more active than the cylindrical surface. The strong polarization caused damage to the carbon fiber, particularly on the exposed cross-section. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Among all nanomaterials, magnetic nanoparticles, microparticles, and beads are unique in offering facile conjugation of biorecognition probes for selective capturing of any desired analytes from complex real sample matrices (e.g., biofluids such as whole blood, serum, urine and saliva, tissues, food, and environmental samples). In addition, rapid separation of the particle-captured analytes by the simple use of a magnet for subsequent detection on a sensor unit makes the magnetic particle sensor approach very attractive. The easy magnetic isolation feature of target analytes is not possible with other inorganic particles, both metallic (e.g., gold) and non-metallic (e.g., silica), which require difficult centrifugation and separation steps. Magnetic particle biosensors have thus enabled ultra-low detection with ultra-high sensitivity that has traditionally been achieved only by radioactive assays and other tedious optical sources. Moreover, when traditional approaches failed to selectively detect low-concentration analytes in complex matrices (e.g., colorimetric, electrochemistry, and optical methods), magnetic particle-incorporated sensing strategies enabled sample concentration into a defined microvolume of large surface area particles for a straightforward detection. The objective of this article is to highlight the ever-growing applications of magnetic materials for the detection of analytes present in various real sample matrices. The central idea of this paper was to show the versatility and advantages of using magnetic particles for a variety of sample matrices and analyte types and the adaptability of different transducers with the magnetic particle approaches.

GR-SnO2 nanocomposite was synthesized by a simple solution method and further characterized by TEM and SEM, which exhibited large surface area beneficial for Mb immobilization. Spectroscopic results indicated Mb retained its native structure without denaturation after mixed with nanocomposite. Electrochemical investigation showed that a pair of well-defined redox peaks appeared on cyclic voltammogram, indicating that direct electron transfer of Mb with the underlying electrode was realized. The results could be attributed to the presence of GR-SnO2 nanocomposite that could enhance the electron transfer between the protein and the electrode. The Mb modified electrode exhibited good stability and catalytic activity to the electroreduction of NaNO2 in the concentration range from 0.2 to 350.0 mu mol L-1 with wider dynamic range and lower detection limit. Therefore the fabricated electrode has the potential application in the third-generation electrochemical biosensor. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

A particular challenge in this field has been the ability to conduct electrochemical studies at the open ends of CNTs, without measuring contributions from the sidewalls. Here, we report on electrochemical measurements taken from the sidewall of highly densified multiwalled carbon nanotube fibers (HD-CNTf) and the cross section (i.e., open ends) of highly densified multiwalled carbon nanotube fibers (HD-CNTfs) embedded in a polymer matrix. The cross section of the HD-CNTfs was exposed to reveal only open ends to the electrolyte interface, and this platform allowed us to compare electrochemistry at the open ends and sidewalls of HD-CNTfs. Cyclic voltammetry was employed to examine the electrochemical properties of HD-CNTfs by using a conventional bulk electrochemical cell and microcapillary electrochemical measurements. The cross sections and sidewalls of HD-CNTfs are shown to promote similar electron transfer kinetics and electrochemical activity.

Here, we discuss the solution-phase interactions of lithium, sodium, potassium, and alkylammonium cations with the Lindqvist-type polyoxovanadate alkoxide (POV alkoxide) cluster, [V6O7(OCH3)(12)]. In all cases, the presence of alkali cations positively shifts the half-wave potentials of the reduction events of the POV alkoxide cluster relative to alkylammonium. In contrast, the two cluster oxidation events are not affected by the presence of alkali ions, indicating that the observed changes in reduction potentials are the result of unique interactions with charge-compensating cations. Further analysis of the shift in reduction potential shows that the energetics of cation binding to the reduced cluster depend both on the charge state of the complex and the charge density of the compensating ion. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies indicate that two {Li}(+) ions undergo site-selective coordination to opposite faces of the octahedron upon complete reduction, manifesting in sluggish reoxidation of this tightly associated, ion-paired species. Thus, this single molecular complex demonstrates redox behavior that spans the range from nonspecific to highly specific cation binding, which is directly analogous to the transition from double-layer capacitance to pseudocapacitance in bulk energy storage electrodes.

J	Milton, RD; Minteer, SD				Milton, Ross D.; Minteer, Shelley D.			Nitrogenase Bioelectrochemistry for Synthesis Applications	ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH			English	Review							HABER-BOSCH PROCESS; ELECTRON-TRANSFER; MOFE PROTEIN; REDUCTION; REDOX; MECHANISM; COFACTOR; AMMONIA; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; FUNDAMENTALS	CONSPECTUS: The fixation of atmospheric dinitrogen to ammonia by industrial technologies (such as the Haber Bosch process) has revolutionized humankind. In contrast to industrial technologies, a single enzyme is known for its ability to reduce or "fix" dinitrogen: nitrogenase. Nitrogenase is a complex oxidoreductase enzymatic system that includes a catalytic protein (where dinitrogen is reduced) and an electron-transferring reductase protein (termed the Fe protein) that delivers the electrons necessary for dinitrogen fixation. The catalytic protein most commonly contains a FeMo cofactor (called the MoFe protein), but it can also contain a VFe or FeFe cofactor. Besides their ability to fix dinitrogen to ammonia, these nitrogenases can also reduce substrates such as carbon dioxide to formate. Interestingly, the VFE nitrogenase can also form carbon-carbon bonds. The vast majority of research surrounding nitrogenase employs the Fe protein to transfer electrons, which is also associated with the rate-limiting step of nitrogenase catalysis and also requires the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate. Thus, there is significant interest in artificially transferring electrons to the catalytic nitrogenase proteins. In this Account, we review nitrogenase electrocatalysis whereby electrons are delivered to nitrogenase from electrodes. We first describe the use of an electron mediator (cobaltocene) to transfer electrons from electrodes to the MoFe protein. The reduction of protons to molecular hydrogen was realized, in addition to azide and nitrite reduction to ammonia. Bypassing the rate-limiting step within the Fe protein, we also describe how this approach was used to interrogate the rate-limiting step of the MoFe protein: metal-hydride protonolysis at the FeMo-co. This Account next reviews the use of cobaltocene to mediate electron transfer to the VFe protein, where the reduction of carbon dioxide and the formation of carbon-carbon bonds (yielding the formation of ethene and propene) was realized. This approach also found success in mediating electron transfer to the FeFe catalytic protein, which exhibited improved carbon dioxide reduction in comparison to the MoFe protein. In the final example of mediated electron transfer to the catalytic protein, this Account also reviews recent work where the coupling of infrared spectroscopy with electrochemistry enabled the potential-dependent binding of carbon monoxide to the FeMo-co to be studied. As an alternative to mediated electron transfer, recent work that has sought to transfer electrons to the catalytic proteins in the absence of electron mediators (by direct electron transfer) is also reviewed. This approach has subsequently enabled a thermodynamic landscape to be proposed for the cofactors of the catalytic proteins. Finally, this Account also describes nitrogenase electrocatalysis whereby electrons are first transferred from an electrode to the Fe protein, before being transferred to the MoFe protein alongside the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate. In this way, increased quantities of ammonia can be electrocatalytically produced from dinitrogen fixation. We discuss how this has led to the further upgrade of electrocatalytically produced ammonia, in combination with additional enzymes (diaphorase, alanine dehydrogenase, and transaminase), to selective production of chiral amine intermediates for pharmaceuticals. This Account concludes by discussing current and future research challenges in the field of electrocatalytic nitrogen fixation by nitrogenase.

The composition and morphology of the product obtained by different cell voltage electrolysis were analyzed by XRD and SEM. The reduction mechanism of solid Fe2O3 was a three-step electronic process, and two electrons were transferred each time to reduce it to metal iron (Fe2O3 -> Fe3O4 -> FeO -> Fe). Among them, Fe3O4 and FexO were produced in the process. In addition, an electrolysis voltage of 1.2 similar to 3.0 V was selected for constant potential electrolysis to determine the high current efficiency and low energy consumption. Finally, when an electrolysis voltage of 1.2V was applied, metallized iron with a particle size of 5 mu m was obtained, and the current efficiency was 95.3%. The energy consumption was 3.35 kWh/kg. These studies provide a reasonable potential range process parameter for the green preparation of metallic iron by molten salt electrolysis.

Herein, an aluminum-selenium (Al-Se) battery that operates at room temperature with high energy efficiency is reported. This Al-Se battery exhibits high selenium utilization with a discharge capacity of 607 mAh g(-1), a reduced overpotential, and high volumetric capacity for over 100 cycles. Furthermore, ex-situ spectroscopic and microscopic investigations of the Se cathodes indicated the existence of an aluminum selenide component as the discharge product. Additionally, in-situ transmission electron microscopy provided not only insights into understanding the Al-Se electrochemistry, but also a real-time characterization technique to evaluate the electrochemistry of AIBs in general.

Through a series of atomic force microscopy experiments, we demonstrate that two competing ionic strains arising from molar volume changes and electrochemical dipoles in a dual-ion system can reveal themselves in distinct relaxation behavior, enabling us to decouple their respective contributions and thus measure local diffusivity along with activation energy. Using soda-lime float glass as a model system, we observe a fast relaxation corresponding to diffusion of Na+ and a slow relaxation associated with electrochemical dipoles formed between Na+ and non-bridging oxygen. Assisted by simulations, we determine the local diffusivity of 5.64 x 107 16 m(2)/s and activation energy of 0.55eV for Na+ at 100 degrees C. The study provides a powerful tool to resolve local dynamics of dual ions, which can be applied to study a variety of complex energy conversion and storage systems.

However, the reaction mechanism often involves both transition-metal and oxygen activities that remain elusive. Here we report a comprehensive study of both cationic and anionic redox mechanisms of LiNiO2 nearly full delithiation. Selection of pure LiNiO2 removes the complication of multiple transition metals. Using combined X-ray absorption spectroscopy, resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, and operando differential electrochemical mass spectrometry, we are able to clarify the redox reactions of transition metals in the bulk and at the surface, reversible lattice oxygen redox, and irreversible oxygen release associated with surface reactions. Many findings presented here bring attention to different types of oxygen activities and metal-oxygen interactions in layered oxides, which are of crucial importance to the advancement of a Ni-rich layered oxide cathode for high capacity and long cycling performance.

Nano-folded Gold Catalysts for Electroreduction of Carbon Dioxide	NANO LETTERS			English	Article						Catalysis; electrochemistry; nanomechanics; self-assembly; internal diffusion	ELECTROCATALYTIC CO2 REDUCTION; ELECTROCHEMICAL REDUCTION; AU NANOPARTICLES; NANOPOROUS GOLD; EFFICIENT; NANOSTRUCTURES; SELECTIVITY; GRAPHENE; FILMS	The local structure and geometry of catalytic interfaces can influence the selectivity of chemical reactions. Selectivity is often critical for the practical realization of reactions such as the electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2). Previously developed strategies to manipulate the structure and geometry of catalysts for electroreduction of CO2 involve complex processes or fail to efficiently alter the selectivity. Here, using a prestrained polymer, we uniaxially and biaxially compress a 60 nm gold film to form a nano-folded electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction. We observe two kinds of folds and can tune the ratio of loose to tight folds by varying the extent of prestrain in the polymer. We characterize the nano-folded catalysts using X-ray diffraction, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy. We observe grain reorientation and coarsening in the nano-folded gold catalysts. We measure an enhancement of Faradaic efficiency for carbon monoxide formation with the biaxially compressed nano-folded catalyst by a factor of about nine as compared to the flat catalyst (up to 87.4%). We rationalize this observation by noting that an increase of the local pH in the tight folds of the catalyst outweighs the effects of alterations in grain characteristics. Together, our studies demonstrate that nano-folded geometries can significantly alter grain characteristics, mass transport, and catalytic performance.

Using an ionic-liquid-based electrolyte, [EMIM]BF4, offers the additional benefit of higher CO2 solubility compared to water-based electrolytes. In this work we quantitatively evaluated the effects of flow-driven reactant transport on electrode activity and selectivity for the electrochemical CO2RR in [EMIM]BF4. High-surface-area porous flow-through electrodes were fabricated by wet-chemical deposition of Ag nanoflowers on commercial macroporous Al foams. At the highest electrolyte flow-through rate of 100 mL min(-1), we observed a 70-fold increase in partial CO current density, and a 7-fold increase in the Faradaic efficiency toward CO, from 10% without flow to 75% with flow. At the same time, the selectivity changed from oxalate as the main product without flow to CO in the electrolyte flow-through configuration. These results demonstrate that the flow-through approach provides a promising path forward to control selectivity and to overcome mass-transport limitations of the electrochemical CO2RR.

Leveraging electrochemistry to uncover the role of nitrogen in the biological reactivity of nitrogen-doped graphene	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-NANO			English	Article							OXYGEN REDUCTION REACTION; CARBON NANOTUBES; ELECTROCATALYTIC ACTIVITY; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; ANTIMICROBIAL PROPERTIES; ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY; CATALYTIC-ACTIVITY; OXIDE; ENERGY; GLUTATHIONE	While nitrogen doping greatly broadens graphene applications, relatively little is known about the influence of this heteroatom on the biological activity of graphene. A set of systematically modified nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) materials was synthesized using the hydrothermal method in which the degree of N-doping and N-bonding type is manipulated using two nitrogen precursors (urea and uric acid) and different thermal annealing temperatures. The bioactivity of the NG samples was evaluated using the oxidation of the intracellular antioxidant glutathione (GSH) and bacterial viability (of Escherichia coli K12), and oxidative stress was identified as the predominant antibacterial mechanism. Two key energy-relevant electrochemical reactions, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), were used to characterize the influence of different N-types on the electronic properties of the NG materials. Electron-donating graphitic-N and electron-withdrawing pyridinic-N were identified as effective promoters for ORR and OER, respectively. The similar mechanisms between the GSH oxidation (indicative of oxidative stress) and ORR mechanisms reveal the role of graphitic-N as the active site in oxidative stress related bioactivity, independent of other consequential properties (e.g., defect density, surface area). This work advances a growing rational design paradigm for graphene family materials using chemical composition and further provides valuable insight into the performance-hazard tradeoffs of NG applications in related fields.

Advances in lithium ion batteries (LIB) indeed represent a great step in this direction. However, lithium is scarce and expensive, Batteries based on more earth-abundant elements such as sodium are attractive replacements. Layered transition metal oxides with sodium in the interlayer are promising battery cathode materials. Here we report the synthesis of a series of NaMO2 (M = Mn, Fe, Co and Ni) materials and analysis of their thermodynamic stability using high temperature oxide melt solution calorimetry. Their formation enthalpies from corresponding binary oxides are highly exothermic. The NaMO2 materials are thermodynamically more stable than their LiMO2 counterparts owing to higher electropositivity of Na+ over Li+. The formation enthalpies become less exothermic in the sequence Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, a trend seen in many other ternary transition metal oxides.

Unfortunately, such cathodes suffer from extremely poor performance at elevated temperatures, which may prevent their use in large-scale energy storage applications. Here we report that replacing commonly used organic electrolytes with solid polymer electrolytes may overcome this hurdle. We demonstrate long-cycle stability for over 300 cycles at 50 degrees C attained in high-capacity (>450 mAh g(-1)) FeF2 cathodes. The absence of liquid solvents reduced electrolyte decomposition, while mechanical properties of the solid polymer electrolyte enhanced cathode structural stability. Our findings suggest that the formation of an elastic, thin and homogeneous cathode electrolyte interphase layer on active particles is a key for stable performance. The successful operation of metal fluorides at elevated temperatures opens a new avenue for their practical applications and future successful commercialization.

Herein, we employ dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS) as a model compound to investigate the capacity fading mechanism and propose a solution to improve its cycling stability. Our results reveal that both DMTS and its discharge products (e.g., LiSCH3, LiSSCH3) are soluble in the electrolyte, leading to severe active material migration and loss, which becomes the predominant capacity fading mechanism. A three-dimensional nitrogen-doped graphene sponge decorated with Fe3O4 nanoparticles (3DFNG) is designed as a host for DMTS, which effectively confine the active material, enabling a specific capacity of 822 mA h g(-1) at C/10 rate and good cycling stability for 500 cycles with a capacity decay of as low as 0.09% per cycle. This work is expected to open up a promising direction to realize highly efficient hosts for lithium-organosulfur batteries.

There are significant technology gaps in the recovery of lithium-ion battery materials that threaten the sustainability of these industries. Cathode healing is introduced here as a new approach to produce low cost (i.e. < $10/kg), recycled, battery grade electrode material. The soft-chemical treatment non-destructively recycles cathodes. Two examples are shown in this work: LiNi(0.5)Co(0.2)Mna(3)O(2) and LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM 523 and NCM 622). The cathodes were harvested from end-of-life cells and further processed with cathode-healing methods to reproduce recycled electrodes with performance equivalent to the original manufactured baseline material. The so-called healed cathodes were built into 2Ah test cells and compared side-by-side with the baseline. Healed NCM 523 performed like the baseline, recording over 2,100 charge-discharge cycles to reach 80% of original capacity. The cathode healing process was modified to fully recover end-of-life NCM 622. Powder X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data support the lithium capacity measurements with structural models. These analyses show that cathode healing reverses cation mixing by oxidizing nickel to reproduce well-ordered, high-capacity material. These examples show the technical feasibility and low-cost opportunity for cathode healing to enable sustainability in the electric vehicle and energy storage industries. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, we compare a newer form of graphene, carbon nanospikes (CNSs), with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) grown on wires and carbon fibers (CFs). CNS electrodes have a short, dense, defect-filled surface that produces remarkable electrochemical properties, much better than CNTs or CFs. The CNS surface roughness is 5.5 times greater than glassy carbon, while CNTs enhance roughness only 1.8-fold. D/G ratios are higher for CNS electrodes than CNT electrodes, an indication of more defect sites. For cyclic voltammetry of dopamine and ferricyanide, CNSs have both higher currents and smaller Delta E-p values than CNTs and CFs. CNS electrodes also have a very low resistance to charge transfer. With fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV), CNS electrodes have enhanced current density for dopamine and cationic neurotransmitters due to increased adsorption to edge plane sites. This study establishes that not all carbon nanomaterials are equally advantageous for dopamine electrochemistry, but that short, dense nanomaterials that add defect sites provide improved current and electron transfer. CNSs are simple to mass fabricate on a variety of substrates and thus could be a favorable material for neurotransmitter sensing. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	[Cao, Qun; Venton, B.

The NAC film was prepared from activated carbon powder and nanocellulose gel using the casting method. The nanocellulose contents in the films were varied from 15% to 50% (w/w). Physicochemical properties of the produced films such as electrical conductivity, water absorption capacity, solubility in water and mechanical properties were measured. The electrical conductivity of the NAC film decreased when nanocellulose content increased. The tensile strength (TS), strain and Young's modulus of films increased significantly from 0.03 to 4.78 MPa, 0.13 to 1.94% and 97.64 to 247.3 MPa, respectively, when the nanocellulose contents increased. Thermal stability was also determined using thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results showed that thermal decomposition was occurred in a temperature range of 300-400 degrees C.

However, the critical step towards the application of BP is still contingent on successfully exfoliating the bulk material into few-layer phosphorene nanosheets. Herein, we show a one-step, facile, and environmentally friendly method of bipolar electrochemical exfoliation-and-deposition of BP nanosheets on a positive feeding electrode. The exfoliated-and-deposited material is high-quality phosphorene with an orthorhombic crystal structure, and it adheres onto the substrate with a fractal and structured morphology. The electrochemical performance of the material was evaluated in a symmetric two-electrode configuration soaked in aqueous electrolyte for capacitive energy storage application. The results revealed fractional-order capacitive behaviour in the low-to-medium frequency, and a high stability and reversibility for at least 40 000 cycles. The power performance is outstanding with 0.35 mW cm(-2) at a constant current rate of 0.5 mA cm(-2).

Our theoretical results reveal that N, S, B, and P-doped graphene can enhance the catalytic activity toward HER compared with the pristine graphene, and S doped graphene exhibits more favorable performance than N doped graphene, consistent with the experimental results. For the Co-X-4 embedded graphene (X=N, S, B, and P), we predict that S may be a promising dopant in graphene supported single atom Co. The rather low hydrogen adsorption free energy (-0.07 eV) and activation energy barrier (0.78 eV) for the rate-determining step, the downshift of the d band center, the enhanced charge density of d(z)(2) orbital as well as the reduced work function are responsible for the unexpected activity of Co-S-4 embedded graphene for HER. Overall, Co-S-4 embedded graphene catalyst could be a good candidate for hydrogen evolution reaction.

This has led to the establishment of 'band-engineering' as a leading principle for the discovery of more efficient photocatalysts. In such a picture, mainly thermodynamic aspects are taken into account, while kinetics are often ignored. This holds in particular for chemical kinetics, which are, other than those for charge carrier dynamics, often not at all considered for the interpretation of the catalysts' photocatalytic performance. However, while being usually neglected in photocatalyis, they are a traditional and powerful tool in thermal catalysis and are still applied with great success in this field. While surface science studies made substantial contributes to thermal catalysis, analogous studies in heterogeneous photocatalysis still play only a minor role. In this review, the authors show that the photo-physics of defined materials in well-defined environments can be correlated with photochemical events on a surface, highlighting the importance of well-characterized semiconductors for the interpretation of mechanisms in heterogeneous photochemistry. The work focuses on contributions from surface science, which were obtained for the model system of a titania single crystal and alcohol photo-reforming. It is demonstrated that only surface science studies have so far enabled the elucidation of molecularly precise reaction mechanisms, the determination of reaction intermediates and assignment of reactive sites. As the identification of these properties remain major prerequisites for a breakthrough in photocatalysis research, the work also discusses the implications of the findings for applied systems. In general, the results from surface science demonstrate that photocatalytic systems shall also be approached by a perspective originating from heterogeneous catalysis rather than solely from an electrochemical point of view.

Understanding X-ray Spectroscopy of Carbonaceous Materials by Combining Experiments, Density Functional Theory, and Machine Learning. Part I: Fingerprint Spectra	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							C-1S CORE EXCITON; AMORPHOUS-CARBON; TA-C; PHOTOELECTRON-SPECTROSCOPY; ELECTROCHEMICAL DETECTION; ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; BINDING-ENERGIES; SURFACES; DIAMOND	Carbonaceous materials, especially tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C), can form complex functionalized surface structures and are thus promising candidates for applications in biomedical devices and electrochemistry. Functional groups at ta-C surfaces have been widely studied by spectroscopic techniques; however, interpretation of the experimental data is extremely difficult, especially in the case of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The assignments of experimental XPS and XAS signals are normally based on references obtained from molecular or crystalline samples, which are simplified approximations for the far more complex amorphous structures. Here, we use extensive density functional theory (DFT) simulations to predict XAS and XPS signatures for carbon-based materials in more realistic environments, building on large data sets of structural models generated by a machine-learning (ML) interatomic potential. The results indicate clear signatures: individual fingerprint XAS spectra and distinctive XPS binding energy distributions, both in terms of center and broadness of the signal, for chemically different groups. The results point out what kind of structural information can and cannot be extracted with X-ray spectroscopy. This study will enable a deeper physicochemical understanding of experimental data and ultimately theory-based identification and quantification of functional groups in carbonaceous materials.

Investigation of Adsorption Thermodynamics at Electrified Liquid-Solid Interfaces by Electrochemically Modulated Liquid Chromatography	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							REVERSED-PHASE; TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE; ION-EXCHANGE; SEPARATION SELECTIVITY; AQUEOUS-SOLUTIONS; ELEVATED-TEMPERATURES; RETENTION MECHANISM; COLUMN TEMPERATURE; STATIONARY-PHASE; PERFORMANCE	A method to investigate electrosorption thermodynamics has been developed by the examination of the temperature dependence of solute retention by means of electrochemically modulated liquid chromatography (EMLC). This hybrid technique couples electrochemistry and liquid chromatography, which enables the manipulation of solute retention through changes in the potential applied (E-app) to a conductive stationary phase like glassy carbon, porous graphitic carbon, and boron-doped diamond. An understanding of the thermodynamics of the EMLC separation mechanism would further the interpretations of the rules to predict retention, which may also provide fundamental insights into sorption processes and the structure of the electrical double layer of importance to a number of other technologies (e.g., battery and fuel cells). This paper describes a study in which the dependence of retention for two naphthalene disulfonates (1,5- and 2,6-naphthalene disulfonates) was measured at different fixed values of E-app [-200 to +200 mV vs Ag/AgCl (sat'd NaCl)] for a glassy carbon chromatographic packing that was held at several different thermally equilibrated column temperatures (22-55 degrees C). These data were analyzed using the van't Hoff relationship to determine the enthalpic and entropic contributions to Gibb's free energy for the transfer of a solute between the mobile and stationary phases. The results for both solutes showed that (1) the retention increased as E-app moved to more positive values, (2) the retention at each value of Eapp became smaller as the column temperature increased, and (3) the dependence of retention on temperature was stronger as the value of Eapp became more negative. The first and second observations follow expectations for the dependence of the electrostatic interaction strength for anionic solutes on the charge on the electrode surface and for the temperature dependence of the exothermic transfer of a solute from the mobile phase to the stationary phase, respectively. The third observation indicates that retention actually becomes more endothermic as the value of E-app becomes more positive, which should conceptually cause a decrease rather than an increase in retention. This points to the somewhat surprising importance of entropy to the overall retention mechanism. That is, the increase in retention at increasingly positive values of E-app reflects the fact that the increase in the entropy for solute transfer has a stronger contribution to the transfer process than the concomitant increase in the endothermicity of transfer. The paper concludes by briefly examining mechanistic origins for the thermodynamic behavior of this system within the context of the electrical double-layer theory and the hydrophobic effect, and possible applications of this intriguing development as a tool for the investigation of electrosorption processes in energy, colloidal, and bioanalytical systems.

Herein, we report unprecedentedly high efficiency for conversion of 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF) to biobased monomers by pairing HMF reduction and oxidation half-reactions in one electrochemical cell. Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of HMF to 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) was achieved under mild conditions using carbon-supported Ag nanoparticles (Ag/C) as the cathode catalyst. The competition between Ag-catalyzed HMF hydrogenation to BHMF and undesired HMF hydrodimerization and hydrogen evolution reactions was sensitive to cathode potential. Also, the carbon support material in Ag/C was active for HMF reduction at strongly cathodic potentials, leading to additional hydrodimerization and low BHMF selectivity. Accordingly, precise control of the cathode potential was implemented to achieve high BHMF selectivity and efficiency. In contrast, the selectivity of HMF oxidation facilitated by a homogeneous electrocatalyst, 4-acetamido-TEMPO (ACT, TEMPO = 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl), together with an inexpensive carbon felt electrode, was insensitive to anode potential. Thus, it was feasible to conduct HMF hydrogenation to BHMF and oxidation to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) in a single divided cell operated under cathode potential control. Electrocatalytic HMF conversion in the paired cell achieved high yields of BHMF and FDCA (85% and 98%, respectively) and a combined electron efficiency of 187%, corresponding to a nearly two-fold enhancement compared to the unpaired cells.

Review-Electrochemistry's Potential to Reach the Ultimate Sensitivity in Measurement Science	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Review							SINGLE NANOPARTICLE COLLISIONS; ACTIVITY THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS; DROPLET COLLISIONS; ELECTROCATALYTIC AMPLIFICATION; MOLECULE ELECTROCHEMISTRY; ELECTROGENERATED CHEMILUMINESCENCE; ELECTROPHORETIC MIGRATION; SILVER NANOPARTICLES; METAL NANOPARTICLES; ELECTRON-TRANSFER	A holy grail in analytical chemistry is the specific quantification of a single entity, be that entity an atom, a molecule, a nanoparticle, a virus, or a circulating tumor cell. Analytical chemistry is entering an era where this sensitivity can be achieved. In these experiments, the limit of detection is 1, and the limit of quantitation is not only measured in units of concentration but units of time: the waiting time before positively identifying a single entity. Electrochemistry is front and center in single entity experiments with hundreds of publications per year detailing observations of various entities colliding with micro- and nano-electrodes. These types of experiments are referred to as 'stochastic electrochemistry' due to the stochastic nature of the collision of an entity with an electrode surface. If methods of detection can be made specific, simple, inexpensive, and robust, the techniques hold the promise of transforming diagnostics (i.e., the specific detection of a single cancerous cell in blood). This review will critically analyze the stochastic electrochemistry literature and focus on reports detailing methods to ensure the response at the electrode surface is specific to the colliding entity. The topic of specificity, and strategies to achieve it, are highlighted. (C) The Author(s) 2019. Published by ECS.

A series of trans-[Co(cyclam)(C(2)NAP (R))Cl]Cl were prepared from the reaction between [Co(cyclam)Cl-2]Cl and HC(2)NAP (R) in the presence of Et3N, where NAP (R) is N-R-1,8-naphthalimide with R as mesityl (Mes, 1a), methyl (Me, 1b), 1-ethylpropyl (Pen, 1c), 2-ethylhexyl (2-ethhex, 1d), or n-octyl (Oct, 1e). Treating compounds 1a and 1b with AgOTf in NCCH3 resulted in trans-[Co(cyclam)(C(2)NAP (R))(NCCH3)](OTf)(2) (2a and 2b, respectively), while reactions with 1c, 1d and 1e under the same conditions yielded only intractable mixtures. More soluble 2a reacted further with HC2Ar in the presence of Et3N to afford trans-[Co(cyclam)(C(2)NAP (R))(C2Ar)](OTf) with Ar as C6H4-4-NMe2 (3a), NAP(Mes) (3b) and Ph (3c). All new complexes were characterized using X-ray diffraction (1a, 1c and 3b), IR, H-1 NMR, UV/Vis and fluorescent spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry.

This tactic involves the use of an impinging jet electrolyte configuration incorporating a gas porous ring connected in turn to a mass spectrometer. The actual amount of N-2 generated at the Au(poly) disk was assayed using the oxidation of hydrazine (N2H4) in aqueous phosphate buffer (pH 7). This redox process yields N-2 as the only product, allowing a direct correlation to be established between the changes in the partial pressures of N-2 and the current flowing through the disk electrode. An analysis of the data collected revealed a strong dependence of fN2NH2OHboth on pH and the applied potential. Although values of fN2NH2OH as high as 20 to 30 % were found in acid and neutral media over a narrow potential region, those in alkaline solution were far smaller in the entire potential range examined.

The intrinsic difficulty of such studies is the fact that at electrode potentials where the OER is observed, the electrode material is highly oxidized. As a consequence, the surface structure during the reaction is in general ill-defined and only scarce knowledge exists concerning the structure-activity relationship of this important reaction. To alleviate these challenging conditions, we chose as starting point well-defined Pt single-crystal electrodes, which we exposed to well-defined conditioning before studying their OER rate. Using this approach, a potential region is identified where the OER on Pt is indeed structure-sensitive with Pt(100) being significantly more active than Pt(111). This experimental finding is in contrast to a DFT analysis of the adsorption strength of the reaction intermediates O*, OH*, and OOH* often used to plot the activity in a volcano curve. It is proposed that as a consequence of the highly oxidizing conditions, the structure-sensitive charge-transfer resistance through the interface determines the observed reaction rate.

Compound 3a represents the first example of an isolated and crystallographically characterized corrole complex of divalent iron. The compound adopts an intermediate-spin state (S = 1), displaying square-planar geometry about the iron atom. All-electron density functional theory (OLYP and B3LYP) calculations with STO-TZP basis sets indicate two essentially equienergetic d electron configurations, d(xy)(2)d(z)(22)d(xz)(1)d(yz)(1) (occupation 1) and d(xy)(2)d(z)(21)d(xz)(1)d(yz)(2) (occupation 2), as likely contenders for the ground state of [Fe-II(TPC)](-), with the optimized geometry of the former in slightly better agreement with the low-temperature X-ray structure. Solutions of 3a react with carbon monoxide to afford the low-spin (S = 0) complex, [Fe(TPC)(CO)](-), whereas introduction of oxygen at -78 degrees C leads to a putative O-2 adduct, [Fe(TPC)(O-2)](-), which decays rapidly even at low temperatures. Treatment of 3a with organic electrophiles results in formal oxidative addition to give both iron(III) and iron(IV) corrole species. With iodomethane, [Fe(TPC)Me] is produced, illustrating the first instance of alkyl ligand coordination in an iron corrole complex.

J	Richburg, CS; Farnum, BH				Richburg, Chase S.; Farnum, Byron H.			Influence of Pyridine on the Multielectron Redox Cycle of Nickel Diethyldithiocarbamate	INORGANIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article							ELECTRON-TRANSFER REACTIONS; METAL-METAL BOND; C-C BOND; STRUCTURAL CONSEQUENCES; ELECTROCHEMICAL REDUCTION; 2-ELECTRON REDUCTION; LINEAR SWEEP; COMPLEXES; OXIDATION; MECHANISM	Two-electron (2e(-))-transfer reactions for monometallic complexes of first-row transition metals are uncommon because of the tendency of these metals to proceed through sequential one-electron (1e(-))-transfer pathways. For this chemistry to be observed, structural changes upon electron transfer are often needed to shift the 1e(-) redox potentials to a condition of potential inversion where 2e(-) transfer becomes favorable. Nickel(II) dithiocarbamate complexes take advantage of these conditions to drive 2e(-) oxidation from Ni-II to Ni-IV. Here, we have studied the electrochemistry of Ni-II(dtc)(2), where dtc(-) is N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate in an acetonitrile solvent as a function of the scan rate and added pyridine to gain further insight into the mechanism for its 2e(-) oxidation to [Ni-IV (dtc)(3)](+). The scan rate dependence revealed evidence for an ECE mechanism in which the chemical step constituted ligand exchange between [Ni-III(dtc)(2)](+) and Ni-II(dtc)(2). A pseudo-first-order rate constant for this reaction of 34 s(-1) was obtained at 1 mM Ni-II(dtc)(2). The addition of pyridine to the electrolyte solution showed pronounced changes to the cyclic voltammetry (CV) that were consistent with the formation of a pyridine-bound Ni-III complex, [Ni-III(dtc)(2)(py)(2)](+), which was stable at high scan rates but decomposed to [Ni-IV(dtc)(3)]+ at low scan rates. The observed decomposition rate constant was well modeled with two parallel decay pathways, one through the dipyridine [Ni-III(dtc)(2)(py)(2)](+) and another through a monopyridine [Ni-III(dtc)(2)(py](+). Overall, these data point to a mechanism for oxidation from Ni-II(dtc)(2) to [Ni-IV(dtc)(3)] + that proceeds through an undercoordinated [Ni-III(dtc)(2)](+) complex, which can be trapped on the time scale of CV experiments using pyridine ligands. These studies provide insight into how we may be able to control 1e(-) versus 2e(-) redox chemistry using the coordination environment and nickel oxidation state.

However, to date, the scope of this catalytic methodology has been limited to benzyl alcohols. In this work, mechanistic understanding of flavin-catalyzed oxidation reactions, in either the absence or presence of thiourea as a cocatalyst, was obtained. The mechanistic insights enabled development of an electrochemically driven photochemical oxidation of primary and secondary aliphatic alcohols using a pair of flavin and dialkylthiourea catalysts. Electrochemistry makes it possible to avoid using O-2 and an oxidant and generating H2O2 as a byproduct, both of which oxidatively degrade thiourea under the reaction conditions. This modification unlocks a new mechanistic pathway in which the oxidation of unactivated alcohols is achieved by thiyl radical mediated hydrogen-atom abstraction.

The proton NMR spectra for these contracted carbaporphyrinoids showed the internal CH upfield at ca. 2 ppm, while the bridging methine units appeared downfield between 8 and 10 ppm, demonstrating that the macrocycles possess significant 14 pi electron diamagnetic ring currents. Although protonated azulitriphyrins(1.2.1) proved to be very stable, the free base forms were unstable and could not be isolated. Treatment of an azulitriphyrin with KOt-Bu-t-BuOOH gave rise to oxidative ring contractions that afforded the first examples of benzocarbatriphyrins. These contracted porphyrinoids also exhibit aromatic ring currents, and the internal CH resonances shifted upfield to 0.5-0.7 ppm. Protonation afforded cations with slightly enhanced diatropic properties. Nucleus independent chemical shift and anisotropy of induced current density calculations confirmed that benzocarbatriphyrins are 14 pi electron delocalized aromatic systems that bypass the fused arene units.

The capability lies in a novel tunable electro-epoxidation of double bonds, where onset of the reaction can be controlled by simply tuning the spray voltage. On-demand formation of mono-/multiple epoxides is achieved at different voltages. The electro-epoxidized products are then fragmented by tandem MS to generate diagnostic ions, indicating the double bond position(s). The process is completed within seconds, holding great potential for high-throughput analysis. The rapid switch-on/off electro-epoxidation of a single sample, the low sample consumption, the demonstrated applicability to complex lipids containing multiple double bonds, and the advantage of not requiring extra apparatus make this method attractive for use in lipid-related biological studies.

Coupled Electron- and Phase-Transfer Reactions at a Three-Phase Interface	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							LIQUID/LIQUID INTERFACES; INSERTION PROCESSES; MASS-TRANSFER; OIL DROPLETS; VOLTAMMETRY; SINGLE; WATER; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; SPECTROSCOPY; MICROSCOPY	Coupled electron- and phase-transfer reactions are fundamentally important in electrochemical energy conversion and storage, e.g., intercalation of Li+ in batteries and electrochemistry at the three-phase boundary in fuel cells. The mechanism, energetics, and kinetics of these complex reactions play an important role in device performance. Herein, we describe experimental methodology to quantitatively investigate coupled electron- and phase-transfer reactions at an individual, geometrically well-defined, three-phase interface. Specifically, a Pt-Ir wire electrode is placed across a H2O/1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) interface, creating a Pt-Ir/H2O/DCE boundary that is defined mathematically by a line around the surface of the wire. We investigated the oxidation of ferrocene (Fc), initially present in DCE (but essentially insoluble in water), at the three-phase boundary, and the transfer of its charged reaction product ferrocenium (Fc(+)) across the interface into the aqueous phase. In cyclic voltammetry, a reversible wave at E-1/2 similar to 0.58 V is observed for Fc oxidation in DCE on the first scan. The Fc(+) produced near the H2O/DCE interface transfers into the aqueous phase. On the second and subsequent cycles, a second reversible wave at more negative potentials, E-1/2 similar to 0.33 V, is observed, corresponding to the reduction of Fc(+) (and reoxidation back to Fc) in the aqueous phase. Finite-element simulations quantitatively capture the voltammetric response of coupled electron and phase transfer at the three-phase interface and indicate that the electrochemical response observed in the aqueous phase occurs within similar to 200 mu m of the Pt-Ir/H2O/DCE boundary. Finally, we demonstrate that the rate of transfer of Fc(+) is strongly dependent on the concentration of supporting electrolyte, reaching a maximum at an intermediate electrolyte concentration, suggesting a critical role of the electric field distribution in determining the reaction rates at the three-phase interface.

J	Yu, XW; Yu, WA; Manthiram, A				Yu, Xingwen; Yu, Wiley A.; Manthiram, Arumugam			A Unique Single-Ion Mediation Approach for Crossover-Free Nonaqueous Redox Flow Batteries with a Na+-Ion Solid Electrolyte	SMALL METHODS			English	Article						electrochemistry; energy storage; nonaqueous redox flow batteries; single-ion mediation; solid electrolyte	RENEWABLE ENERGY-SOURCES; FOSSIL-FUELS; STORAGE; FOOD; NITROBENZENE; WATER; INTERMITTENCY; GENERATION; VEHICLE; SOLAR	Nonaqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs) provide significant advantages over aqueous RFBs because the use of nonaqueous electrolytes offers the possibilities of operating RFBs at higher voltages (above the water break-down voltage) and low temperatures (below 0 degrees C, the freezing point of H2O). However, the advancement of RFBs has long been plagued by the chemical-crossover problem due to a lack of reliable separators. Herein, a single-ion mediation strategy is presented for the advancement of nonaqueous RFBs by employing a Na+-ion solid electrolyte. The catholyte and anolyte in a single cell are physically and electrically separated, but the redox reactions at the cathode and anode are ionically linked by sodium ions, which shuttle between the catholyte and anolyte through the solid electrolyte. To accommodate the mediating Na+-ions, both the catholyte and anolyte are well managed through the addition of appropriate supporting electrolytes. The proposed unique RFB concept is validated with a chromium (III) acetylacetonate symmetric redox chemistry and the nitrobenzene-bromine redox couple.

Establishing an efficient electron transfer route between redox enzymes and electrodes is key for converting enzyme-catalyzed reactions into electrochemical signals, and for the development of robust, sensitive, and selective biosensors. We demonstrate that the site-specific incorporation of a novel synthetic amino acid (2-amino-3-(4-mercaptophenyl)propanoic acid) into redox enzymes, followed by an S-click reaction to wire the enzyme to the electrode, facilitates electron transfer. The fabricated biosensor demonstrated real-time and selective monitoring of tryptophan (Trp) in blood and sweat samples, with a linear range of 0.02-0.8 mm. Further developments along this route may result in dramatic expansion of portable electrochemical sensors for diverse health-determination molecules.

Tailoring intermolecular interactions to develop a low-temperature electrolyte system consisting of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide and organic solvents	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							IONIC LIQUID; EXCHANGE-REACTION; MIXTURES; SUPERCAPACITORS; WATER; BEHAVIOR; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; CONDUCTIVITY; STABILITY; TRANSPORT	Ionic liquids (ILs) exhibit remarkable properties and great tunability, which make them an attractive class of electrolyte materials for a variety of electrochemical applications. However, despite the promising progress for operating conditions at high temperatures, the development of their low-temperature viability as electrolytes is still limited due to the constrains from thermal and ion transport issues with a drastic decrease in temperature. In this study, we present a liquid electrolyte system based on a mixture of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide ([BMIM][I]), gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), propylene carbonate (PC), and lithium iodide (LiI) and utilize its molecular interactions to tailor its properties for extremely low-temperature sensing applications. In particular, the carbonyl group on both PC and GBL can form hydrogen bonds with the imidazolium cation, as indicated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and the extent of these interactions between ions and molecules was also characterized and quantified via proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) spectroscopy. More importantly, at the optimal ratio, the organic solvents do not have excess content to form aggregates, which may cause undesired crystallization before the glass transition. The microscopic evolutions of the systems are correlated with their bulk behaviors, leading to improvements in their thermal and transport properties. The optimized formulation of [BMIM][I]/PC/GBL/LiI showed a low glass transition temperature (T-g) of -120 degrees C and an effectively reduced viscosity of 0.31 Pa s at -75 degrees C. The electrochemical stability of the electrolyte was also validated to support the targeted iodide/triiodide redox reactions without interference.

However, the properties of intrinsic metal sulfide anodes usually decay rapidly at initial cycling of batteries. Previously, it was believed that the low conductivity and volume expansion of metal sulfides lead to the poor performance. Here, using in situ batteries followed by the assistance of spectral analysis, it is shown that the polysulfide shuttling effect is one of the crucial factors for the degradation of metal sulfide anodes beyond traditional consensus of low conductivity and volume expansion. Furthermore, a novel strategy by controlling the dissolution of sodium polysulfides in selected electrolyte is proposed to enable intrinsic metal sulfides to work stably in polysulfide-insoluble fluoroethylene carbonate electrolyte, which would decay fast in polysulfide-soluble propylene carbonate electrolyte. This work has deepened the understanding of electrochemical reaction mechanisms of metal sulfide anodes and expanded the strategies to optimize the electrochemical performance of metal sulfides anodes.

We present the development of a thermodynamic and kinetic modeling framework for intercalation electrochemistry within the open-source software Cantera. Instead of using equilibrium potentials and single-step Butler-Volmer kinetics, Cantera is based on molar thermodynamic data and mass-action kinetics, providing a physically-based and flexible means for complex reaction pathways. Herein, we introduce a new thermodynamic class for intercalation materials into the open-source software. We discuss the derivation of molar thermodynamic data from experimental half-cell potentials, and provide practical guidelines. We then demonstrate the new class using a single-particle model of a lithium cobalt oxide/graphite lithium-ion cell, implemented in MATLAB. With the present extensions, Cantera provides a platform for the lithium-ion battery modeling community both for consistent thermodynamic and kinetic models and for exchanging the required thermodynamic and kinetic parameters.

Tunable optical metamaterial-based sensors enabled by closed bipolar electrochemistry	ANALYST			English	Article							LIGHT; TRANSMISSION; GENERATION; BIOSENSORS	Enabled by the proliferation of nanoscale fabrication techniques required to create spatially-repeating, sub-wavelength structures to manipulate the behavior of visible-wavelength radiation, optical metamaterials are of increasing interest. Here we develop and characterize a chemical sensing approach based on electrochemical tuning of the optical response function of large-area, inexpensive nanoaperture metamaterials at visible and near-IR wavelengths. Nanosphere lithography is used to create an ordered array of sub-wavelength apertures in a Au film. The spacing of these apertures is established during fabrication, based on the size of the polystyrene nanospheres. Tunable shifts in the transmission spectrum can be produced post-fabrication by electrodeposition of a dissimilar metal, Ag, using the nanoaperture film as one electrode in a 2-electrode closed bipolar electrochemical (CBE) cell, altering hole size, film thickness, and film composition while maintaining hole spacing dictated by the original pattern. Optical transmission spectra acquired under galvanostatic conditions can be expressed as a linear combination of the initial and final (saturated) spectra, and the resulting response function exhibits a sigmoidal response with respect to the amount of charge (or metal) deposited. This architecture is then used to perform optical coulometry of model analytes in a CBE-based analyte-reporter dual cell device, thus expanding the capability of CBE-based sensors. Increasing the exposed electrode area of the analyte cell increases the response of the device, while modifying the circuit resistance alters the balance between sensitivity and dynamic range. These tunable nanoaperture metamaterials exhibit enhanced sensitivity compared to CBE electrochromic reporter cells to the mu M to nM concentration range, suggesting further avenues for development of CBE-based chemical sensors as well as application to inexpensive, point-of-care diagnostic devices.

An initial consensus was reached on structural rearrangement, then leaned toward the newly discovered lattice oxygen activity. It is challenging to differentiate their explicit roles because these events typically coexist during the electrochemical reaction of most Li-rich layered oxides. Here, the voltage decay behavior is probed in Li1.2Ni0.2Ru0.6O2, a structurally and electrochemically relevant compound to Li, Mn-rich layered oxide, but of no oxygen activity. Such intriguing characteristics allow the explicit decoupling of the contribution of transition metal migration and lattice oxygen activity to voltage decay in Li-rich layered oxides. The results demonstrate that the microstructural evolution, mainly originating from transition metal migration, is a direct cause of voltage decay, and lattice oxygen activity likely accelerates the decay.

In this work, we provide compelling evidence that the pH dependent shift in the H-upd peak on Pt surfaces is driven by the structure of interfacial water rather than the specific adsorption of cations on the electrode surface. Combined cyclic voltammetric and surface enhanced spectroscopic investigations using an organic cation and crown-ether chelated alkali metal cations show that specific adsorption of metal and organic cations on the Pt surface at the conditions relevant to the HOR/HER is unlikely. The vibrational band corresponding to strongly bound water is monitored when the electrode potential is varied in the H-upd range in both acid and base.

A fundamental elucidation of electrode-electrolyte interface behaviors is of crucial significance but has proven difficult. The interfacial resistance and capacity fading issues in a solid-state battery were probed, revealing a heterogeneous phase transition evolution at solid-solid interfaces. The strain-induced interfacial change and the contact loss, as well as a dense metallic surface phase, deteriorate the electrochemical reaction in solid-state batteries. Furthermore, the in situ growth of electrolytes on secondary particles is proposed to fabricate robust solid-solid interface. Our study enlightens new insights into the mechanism behind solid-solid interfacial reaction for optimizing advanced solid-state batteries.

PBE0/LANL2DZ provided more accurate geometries to describe S-0 whereas B3LYP/LANL2DZ predicted spectral energies that correlated better with the available experiment data. The Ru (II) complexes with different substituents emit photons ranging from 560 to 610 nm in the series RudMebpy, Rubpy, Rudamidebpy, Rudcbpy. The calculations predicted a maximum emission at about 540 nm for the complex constructed from two carbonyl pi-acceptors ligands trans to the dcbpy, while an emission in the far infrared region is calculated when two H sigma-donor ligands trans to the dcbpy. Our calculation results show correlations between HOMO-LUMO energy gap, Stokes shift, and T-1 distortion, which reflect the different effects of electron-withdrawing and donating groups. We proposed that these correlations can be used to predict the photophysical properties for new complexes. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

While electrochemical reduction into CO and formate are approaching industrial maturity, a current challenge is obtaining more reduced products like methanol. However; literature on the matter is scarce, and even more for the use of molecular catalysts. Here, we demonstrate that cobalt phthalocyanine, a well-known catalyst for the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to CO, can also catalyze the reaction from CO2 or CO to methanol in aqueous electrolytes at ambient conditions of temperature and pressure. The studies identify formaldehyde as a key intermediate and an unexpected pH effect on selectivity. This paves the way for estublishg a sequential process where CO2 is first converted to CO which is subsequently used as a reactant to produce methanol. Under ideal conditions, the reaction shows a global Faradaic efficiency of 19.5 % and chemical selectivity of 7.5 %.

Synthesis, Electrochemistry, and Reversible Interconversion among Perhalogenated Hydroxyphenyl Ni(II) Porphyrins, Porphodimethenes, and Porpho-5,15-bis-paraquinone Methide	INORGANIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article							METAL-COMPLEXES; NICKEL; ABSORPTION; TETRAPHENYLPORPHYRIN; TETRAARYLPORPHYRINS; COBALT(II); BEHAVIOR; CHLORIN	Two octahalogenated nickel(II) hydroxyphenylporphyrins were synthesized and characterized as to their electrochemical and spectroscopic properties as well as their reactivity in neutral, acidic, and basic nonaqueous media. The newly synthesized complexes are represented as NiPorCl(8) and NiPorBr(8), where Por is the dianion of meso-tetrakis(3,5-ditert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)porphyrin. The UV-vis spectra of NiPorCl(8) and NiPorBr(8), vary with the solvent and degree of axial coordination but are almost identical to each other in a given solvent. These spectra are also substantially different from that of the unhalogenated NiPor parent porphyrin (which resembles nickel tetraphenylporphyrin, NiTPP), and they also differ from the spectra of beta-octahalogenated NiTPPCl8 and NiTPPBr8 under the same solution conditions. The NiPorX(8) spectra are stable with time and interpreted in terms of 4- or 6-coordinate derivatives in 13 different nonaqueous solvents. This is not the case, however, in DMF or DMSO, where a transient six-coordinate complex is initially formed upon dissolving the NiPorCl(8), followed by the formation of an air-oxidized porphodimethene-like product called porpho-5,15-bis-paraquinone methide, with the time of this chemical transformation depending upon the concentration of the porphyrin in solution. The initial species formed from NiPorCl(8) and NiPorBr(8), after the first one-electron addition in CH2C12 is stable for short times at -60 degrees C, but this is not the case at room temperature, where a rapid homogeneous chemical reaction occurs. Four additional redox reactions are also observed in CH2C12, and the UV-visible spectra of several in-situ-generated electroreduction products are compared with that of chemically synthesized porphodimethenes formed in neutral, acidic, and basic solutions of CH2C12 containing acid in the form of TFA or base in the form of TBA(+)X, where X = OAc-, CN-, and OH-. Finally, a reversible electrochemically driven conversion between the Ni(II) hydroxyphenylporphyrin and a reduced porphodimethene or oxidized porphyrin-like product, porpho-5,15-bis-paraquinone methide, is described.

Drawing with Iron on a Gel Containing a Supramolecular Siderophore	ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION			English	Article; Early Access						G-quadruplexes; hydrogels; hydroxamic acid; iron; self-assembly	COORDINATION CHEMISTRY; HYDROXAMIC ACIDS; HYDROGELS; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; NUCLEOBASE; REDOX; DNA	Guanosine-5 '-hydroxamic acid (3) forms hydrogels when mixed with guanosine (1) and KCl. The 5 '-hydroxamic acid (HA) unit is pH-responsive and also chelates Fe3+. When gels are prepared under basic conditions, the 5 '-HA groups are deprotonated and the anionic hydrogel binds cationic thiazole orange (TO), signaled by enhanced fluorescence. The HA nucleoside 3, when immobilized in the G-quartet gel, acts as a supramolecular siderophore to form red complexes with Fe3+. We patterned the hydrogel's surface with FeCl3, by hand and by using a 3D printer. Patterns form instantly, are visible by eye, and can be erased using vitamin C. This hydrogel, combining self-assembled G-quartet and siderophore-Fe3+ motifs, is strong, can be molded into different shapes, and is stable on the bench or under salt water.

J	Northrup, P				Northrup, Paul			The TES beamline (8-BM) at NSLS-II: tender-energy spatially resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray fluorescence imaging	JOURNAL OF SYNCHROTRON RADIATION			English	Article						tender energy; microbeam XAS; in situ XAS; XRF microprobes; XANES; EXAFS; NSLS-II	MONOCHROMATOR	The tender-energy X-ray spectroscopy (TES) beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) is now operational for general users. Its scientific mission includes static and in situ X-ray fluorescence imaging and spatially resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy for characterization of complex heterogeneous, structured and dynamic natural or engineered materials and systems. TES is optimized for the tender-energy range, offering routine operations from 2.0 to 5.5 keV, with capabilities to reach down to 1.2 or up to 8 keV with configuration change. TES is designed as an extended X-ray absorption fine-structure microprobe (EXAFS microprobe) for applications of micrometre-scale EXAFS spectroscopy to heterogeneous samples. Beam size is user-tunable from similar to 2 to 25 mu m. Energy may be scanned on-the-fly or in traditional step scanning. Importantly, the position of the microbeam at the sample location does not move significantly during energy scanning or when changing energy across the entire routine energy range. This enables full EXAFS of a particle or domain the same size as the probe beam, and measurement of the same spot at different energies. In addition, there is no measureable drift in energy calibration (repeatability) scan-to-scan and over 24 h. This is critical where simultaneous calibration measurements are generally not feasible, and for speciation mapping where precise and stable control of incident energy is essential. The sample environment is helium atmosphere at room pressure with infrastructure for in situ electrochemistry and catalysis in small sample cells or microreactors. As the first bend-magnet beamline at NSLS-II, noteworthy commissioning aspects are described. Example measurements are presented to illustrate its capabilities.

QCMD is limited by a relatively poor time resolution, which is of the order of seconds with conventional instrument designs at the noise level usually required. In this work, we present a design of an ultrafast QCMD with submillisecond time resolution. It is based on a frequency comb approach applied to a high-fundamental-frequency (HFF) resonator through a multifrequency lock-in amplifier. The combination allows us to reach data acquisition rates >10 kHz. We illustrate the method using a toy model of a glass sphere dropped on the resonator surfaces, bare or coated with liposomes, in liquid. We discuss some interesting features of the results obtained with the dropped spheres, such as bending of the HFF resonators due to the impact, sphere bouncing (or the absence of it), and contact aging.

Nanoscale Visualization and Multiscale Electrochemical Analysis of Conductive Polymer Electrodes	ACS NANO			English	Article						scanning electrochemical cell microscopy; electrochemistry; electron-transfer kinetics; poly(3-hexylthiophene); parasitic resistances; polymer degradation	CELL MICROSCOPY; CHARGE-TRANSFER; RATE CONSTANTS; FILMS; VOLTAMMETRY; KINETICS; CHALLENGES; INTERFACES; GRAPHENE; CONTACTS	Conductive polymers are exceptionally promising for modular electrochemical applications including chemical sensors, bioelectronics, redox-flow batteries, and photoelectrochemical systems due to considerable synthetic tunability and ease of processing. Despite well-established structural heterogeneity in these systems, conventional macroscopic electroanalytical methods-specifically cyclic voltammetry-are typically used as the primary tool for structure property elucidation. This work presents an alternative correlative multimicroscopy strategy. Data from laboratory and synchrotron-based microspectroscopies, including conducting-atomic force microscopy and synchrotron nanoscale infrared spectroscopy, are combined with potentiodynamic movies of electrochemical fluxes from scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) to reveal the relationship between electrode structure and activity. A model conductive polymer electrode system of tailored heterogeneity is investigated, consisting of phase-segregated domains of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) surrounded by contiguous regions of insulating poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), representing an ultramicroelectrode array. Isolated domains of P3HT are shown to retain bulk-like chemical and electronic structure when blended with PMMA and possess approximately equivalent electron-transfer rate constants compared to pure P3HT electrodes. The nanoscale electrochemical data are used to model and predict multiscale electrochemical behavior, revealing that macroscopic cyclic voltammograms should be much more kinetically facile than observed experimentally. This indicates that parasitic resistances rather than redox kinetics play a dominant role in macroscopic measurements in these conductive polymer systems. SECCM further demonstrates that the ambient degradation of the P3HT electroactivity within P3HT/PMMA blends is spatially heterogeneous. This work serves as a roadmap for benchmarking the quality of conductive polymer films as electrodes, emphasizing the importance of nanoscale electrochemical measurements in understanding macroscopic properties.

Due to favorable attributes such as high gravimetric energy density, batteries based broadly on inorganic-ion, and more specifically on Lithium-ion (Li-ion), electrochemistry have emerged as the technologies of choice for current and next-generation consumer electronic devices and electric automobiles. Improvements in critical system metrics such as energy/power density, cycle-life, cost, safety, and technological sustainability rely heavily on multiparameter, multi-scale, and multi-physics optimization of the materials, interfaces, and processes that constitute a battery system. Over the past decade, Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) techniques have delivered important solutions for addressing these technological challenges through new characterization tools at the atomic-tonanoscale. This article presents a comprehensive review of these SPM techniques of relevance for the battery systems. Specifically, each SPM operation mode of relevance, which include atomic force microscopy, electrochemical atomic force microscopy, Kelvin probe force microscopy, electrochemical strain microscopy, scanning ion conductance microscopy, and scanning electrochemical microscopy, have been discussed in terms of their state-of-the-art, applications, advantages, limitations, and future directions. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the following information and insights revealed by these methodologies has been provided: ionic transport and diffusion dynamics, electrochemical activity, surface and interfacial studies, morphological and dimensional changes, and evolution of mechanical properties/their degradation.

In the present work, we show that it is important to have a good quality X-ray absorption spectrum to go beyond an analysis of the only the first coordination shell. Equally important is to analyze both EXAFS and XANES spectra in combination with theoretical modelling to distinguish the relevant phases even in bulk materials and to separate structural from chemical effects. As a first step toward the analysis of thin films, we start with the analysis of bulk references. After that, we successfully demonstrate an approach that allows us to extract high-quality spectra also for 20 nm thin films. Our analysis extends to the second coordination shell and includes effects created by chemical substitution of Hf with Zr to unambiguously discriminate the different polymorphs. The trends derived from X-ray absorption spectroscopy agree well with X-ray diffraction measurements. In this work we clearly identify a gradual transformation from monoclinic to tetragonal phase as the Zr content of the films increases. We separated structural effects from effects created by chemical disorder when ration of Hf:Zr is varied and found differences for the incorporation of the substitute atoms between powders and thin films, which we attribute to the different fabrication routes. This work opens the door for further in-depth structural studies to shine light into the chemistry and physics of these novel ferroelectric thin films that show high application relevance.

Acid-Induced Liberation of Polysubstituted Cyclopentadiene Ligands from Cyclopentadienyl Cobalt: A [2+2+1] Cycloaddition Route toward 1,2,4-Trisubstituted Cyclopentadienes	JOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article							DIELS-ALDER REACTION; SUBSTITUTED CYCLOPENTADIENES; ORGANOMETALLIC COMPOUNDS; COMPLEXES; CHEMISTRY; RANGE; METALLACYCLOBUTENE; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; CYCLIZATION; SYNTHONS	Here, we report that trifluoroacetic acid (TFAH) induces demetallation and protodesilylation of the cyclopentadiene ligand in cobalt-eta(4)-cyclopentadiene complexes of general formula [(eta(5)-C5H5)Co(eta(4)-exo-C(TMS)=C(SO2Ph)CH=CRCH(CO2Et))] (1-Ph, R = Ph; 1-(ArBu)-Bu-t, R = p-(C6H4Bu)-Bu-t; 1-ArNMe2, R = p-C6H4NMe2; and 1-Me, R = Me). The trisubstituted cyclopentadiene products are isolated as a mixture of two tautomers, [(CH2 C(SO2Ph)=CHC(CO2Et)=CR)] (8-R-A) and [(CH=C(SO2Ph)CH2C(CO2Et)=CR)] (8-R-B). The endo isomer, [(eta(5)-C5H5)Co(eta(4)-endo-C(TMS)=C(SO2Ph)CH=CPhCH(CO2Et))] (1-Ph-endo), also undergoes demetallation and protodesilylation to give 8-Ph-A and 8-Ph-B in excellent yield. The cobalt-cyclopentadiene complex, [(eta(5)-C5H5)Co(eta(4)-exo-C(TMS)=C(SO2Ph)CH=C(CO2Me)CH(CO2Et))] (1-CO2Me), undergoes demetallation and protodesilylation upon treatment with TFAH to give a hydrogen-bonded fulvenol (8-CO2Me). Liberation of the ethoxy-substituted cyclopentadiene ligand of [(eta(5)- C5H5)Co(eta(4)-exo-C(TMS)=C(SO2Ph)CH=C(OEt)CH(CO2Et))] (1-OEt) leads to formation of a cyclopentenone derivative (11). Thermolysis of 8-Ph-A/8-Ph-B in the presence of maleimide leads to a highly functionalized Diels-Alder adduct, whereas 8-Ph-A/8-Ph-B serves as precursors to trisubstituted ruthenocenes by in situ deprotonation and reaction with [(eta(5)-C5H5)Ru(NCMe)(3)]PF6(16-H, R = H; 16-Me, R = Me).

Exsolution and electrochemistry in perovskite solid oxide fuel cell anodes: Role of stoichiometry in Sr(Ti,Fe,Ni)O-3	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Solid oxide fuel cell; Sr(Ti,Fe,Ni)O-3; Perovskite anode; Exsolution; Stoichiometry	IN-SITU EXSOLUTION; PERFORMANCE EVALUATION; ALLOY NANOPARTICLES; STABLE ANODE; FE; GROWTH; NI; PRECIPITATION; PARTICLES; LANTHANUM	The exsolution of metal cations from oxides under reducing fuel conditions results in the formation of surface metallic nanoparticles, which can reduce Solid Oxide Fuel Cell anode polarization resistance. However, the loss of the B-site cations shifts the stoichiometry of the perovskite oxide. Depending on the amount exsolved and the initial stoichiometry, the exsolution can presumably shift the oxide away from its single-phase perovskite region. Herein, the direct comparison of initially stoichiometric composition Sr(Ti0.3Fe0.63Ni0.07)O3-delta (STFN0) with initially A-site deficient Sr-0.95(Ti0.3Fe0.63Ni0.07)O3-delta (STFN5) is conducted and reported. X-ray diffraction along with scanning and transmission electron microscopy analysis of the oxides, which are both reduced at 850?degrees C in H-2/H2O/Ar, shows a similar size and density of exsolved Fe-Ni alloy nanoparticles, albeit with slightly different alloy compositions. Whereas the oxide phase in reduced STFN5 shows a well-ordered perovskite structure, the greater B-site deficiency in reduced STFN0 results in a highly disordered and strained structure. The electrochemical performance of STFN0 anodes is inferior to that of STFN5 anodes, and even worse than SrTi0.3Fe0.7O3-delta (Ni-free) anodes. It appears that an initial Sr deficiency is important to avoid a too-high B-site deficiency after exsolution, which distorts the perovskite structure and impairs electrochemical processes.

Though the sewage treatment plants are constructed to meet the demands of cities, distributed treatment units are still in request for the supplementary of centralized purification beyond the range of plants. Electrochemical degradation can reduce organic pollution to some degree, but it has to be powered. Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is a newly-invented technology for low-frequency mechanical energy harvesting. Here, by integrating a rotary TENG (R-TENG) as electric power source with an electrochemical cell containing a modified graphite felt cathode for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) along with hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) generation by Fenton reaction and a platinum sheet anode for active chlorine generation, a self-powered electrochemical system (SPECS) was constructed. Under the driven of mechanical energy or wind flow, such SPECS can efficiently degrade dyes after power management in neutral condition without any O-2 aeration. This work not only provides a guideline for optimizing self-powered electrochemical reaction, but also displays a strategy based on the conversion from distributed mechanical energy to chemical energy for environmental remediation.

Effect of Mg dissolution on cyclic voltammetry and open circuit potentiometry of molten MgCl2-KCl-NaCl candidate heat transfer fluid for concentrating solar power	SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS			English	Article						Concentrating solar power system; Chloride salts; Magnesium; Hydroxide; Electrochemistry	THERMAL-ENERGY STORAGE; CHLORIDE SALTS; CORROSION; LICL; MITIGATION; IMPURITIES; REDUCTION; ALLOYS; PLANTS	Molten chloride salts have recently gained attention for application to heat transfer and thermal energy storage in concentrating solar power (CSP) plants. In this study, we studied the electrochemical effect of addition of hydroxide ions and/or dissolved metals added to MgCl2-KCl-NaCl salt mixture. Open circuit potentiometry indicated that the salt's redox potential increased with addition of hydroxide ions and decreased with the addition of soluble magnesium metal. Cyclic voltammetry indicated that a reduction peak associated with hydroxides vanished with addition of Mg-0. Hydrogen gas was evolved when a mixture of Mg metal and MgCl2-KCl-NaCl containing NaOH was heated to 650 degrees C. These results demonstrate the benefit and mechanism for redox potential control in this salt using dissolved Mg metal.

Herein, electrospun nanofibrous mats made of poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid and chitosan are coated with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) for enhanced oxidation of arsenic. We compared the oxidative properties of UV-irradiated rGO-TiO2 nanocomposite-enabled fibers (rGO-TiO2@fibers) to both their non-reduced counterpart (GO-TiO2@fibers) and TiO2 nanoparticles in suspension. The rGO-TiO2@fibers have a rate constant an order of magnitude larger, and oxidize 2.5 times more As(III), per mass of TiO2 as compared to GO-TiO2@fibers. When bound to UV-illuminated TiO2, GO-and especially the more-conductive rGO-accept electrons from TiO2's valence band, inhibiting electron-hole recombination and increasing production of hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) that oxidize As(III). Hydroxyl radical generation was correlated with As(III) oxidation and used to determine radical-scavenging of the fibers. TiO2 paired with rGO achieved the highest levels of radical production both when bound to fibers and when in suspension, illustrating a synergistic relationship between rGO and TiO2. Reuse properties and titanium leaching of the rGO-TiO2@fibers and GO-TiO2@fibers were evaluated over the course of six oxidative cycles, illustrating limited leaching and consistent enhanced oxidative performance by the rGO-TiO2@fibers. Nanocomposites of rGO-TiO2 have not yet been reported as a surface coating on electrospun fibrous scaffolds, and their applications are typically in dye degradation, bacteria inactivation, and electrochemistry. Through their superior oxidative performance, "green" synthesis, and facile recyclability, rGO-TiO2@fibers herein are an example of nano-enabled technology being strategically leveraged to address water treatment challenges around the world.

The importance of intramolecular conductivity in three dimensional molecular solids	CHEMICAL SCIENCE			English	Article							THIN-FILM TRANSISTORS; CONJUGATED MACROCYCLES; ORGANIC SEMICONDUCTORS; ACCEPTOR; DONOR; TRANSPORT; ELECTRON; SIZE; C-60; 1,6-REGIOISOMERS	Recent years have seen tremendous progress towards understanding the relation between the molecular structure and function of organic field effect transistors. The metrics for organic field effect transistors, which are characterized by mobility and the on/off ratio, are known to be enhanced when the intermolecular interaction is strong and the intramolecular reorganization energy is low. While these requirements are adequate when describing organic field effect transistors with simple and planar aromatic molecular components, they are insufficient for complex building blocks, which have the potential to localize a carrier on the molecule. Here, we show that intramolecular conductivity can play a role in controlling device characteristics of organic field effect transistors made with macrocycle building blocks. We use two isomeric macrocyclic semiconductors that consist of perylene diimides linked with bithiophenes and find that the trans-linked macrocycle has a higher mobility than the cis-based device. Through a combination of single molecule junction conductance measurements of the components of the macrocycles, control experiments with acyclic counterparts to the macrocycles, and analyses of each of the materials using spectroscopy, electrochemistry, and density functional theory, we attribute the difference in electron mobility of the OFETs created with the two isomers to the difference in intramolecular conductivity of the two macrocycles.

The structure, as determined from single-crystal X-ray diffraction data, built up of undulating layers of FeO6 octahedra, consisting of trimers and PO4 tetrahedral units. Magnetic susceptibility measurements show predominant overall anti-ferromagnetic interactions and room temperature Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopic studies confirm the mixed 3+ and 2+ oxidation states of Fe in the compound. The compound is stable up to 400 degrees C and undergo facile electrochemical lithium insertion. Galvanostatic charge-discharge studies indicate that up to 0.7 lithium ions per formula unit can be inserted at an average voltage of 2.6 V. The barbosalite phase seems to undergo irreversible phase transition upon lithiation as evident from the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of the reduced and oxidized phases. (C) The Author(s) 2019.

Silver-Containing alpha-MnO2 Nanorods: Electrochemistry in Rechargeable Aqueous Zn-MnO2 Batteries	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							ZINC-STORAGE; HOLLANDITE; CORROSION; REDUCTION; SVET; NANOFIBERS; CHEMISTRY; MAGNESIUM; IMPACT; MODEL	The reduction and subsequent oxidation of silver hollandite nanorods, Ag1.5Mn8O16, were explored in aqueous ZnSO4 electrolyte for the first time. The impact of reduction on the electrodes was probed where images of recovered cathodes were collected to evaluate the changes in morphology, structural, and electrochemical properties as a function of varying potential. Ag metal particle formation upon reduction was observed on reduction through a reduction-displacement reaction as confirmed by SEM/EDS, XRD, and XAS results accompanied by a decrease in charge transfer impedance, as determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. On charge, in contrast to the reduction/oxidation electrochemistry in non-aqueous media where irreversible formation of silver metal was observed, disappearance of the silver metal is observed indicating oxidation of the silver centers is facilitated in aqueous electrolyte.

The paradigm for enabling function extends far beyond carrier accumulation or depletion in band semiconductors or simply moving ions through an insulating electrolyte. Rather, by carefully selecting electronically or structurally fragile materials, one can collapse or open band gaps via extreme ionic dopant concentration, or reconfigure their entire crystal structure to create new phases. Electron-electron and electron-lattice interactions can be coupled or controlled independently in such systems via electric fields without thermal constraints by use of ionic dopants. The unifying theme across these studies is to introduce ions and electrons via electric fields through interfaces, with electrochemistry playing a dominant role. In this review, we briefly summarize this nascent field of iontronics and discuss principal results to date with examples from binary and complex oxides as well as selected 2D materials systems. We conclude the review by highlighting gaps in fundamental scientific understanding and prospects for the use of such novel devices in future electronic, photonic and energy technologies.

Here using grand-canonical density functional theory calculations, a novel approach is demonstrated that uses aqueous electrochemistry to eliminate the trap states of the vacancies in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides while leaving the perfect part of the material intact. The success of this electrochemical approach is based on the selectivity control by the electrode potential and the isovalence between oxygen and chalcogen. Motivated by these results, electrochemical conditions are further identified to functionalize the vacancies by incorporating various single metal atoms, which can bring in magnetism, tune carrier concentration/polarity, and/or activate single-atom catalysis, enabling a wide range of potential applications. These approaches may be generalized to other 2D materials. The results open up a new avenue for improving the properties and extending the applications of 2D materials.

Synthesis and Properties of Poly-Ether/Ethylene Carbonate Electrolytes with High Oxidative Stability	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							LITHIUM-ION; POLYMERIZATION; 1,3-DIOXOLANE	New electrolyte designs are necessary for overcoming multiple challenges posed by emerging lithium-metal battery chemistries. Task-specific viscoelastic electrolytes are specifically required that are capable of simultaneously sustaining reversible electrochemistry at the Li metal anode, maintaining high oxidative stability at the battery cathode and achieving high room-temperature ionic conductivity in the electrolyte bulk. Here, we synthesize and study a series of polymeric electrolytes composed of poly-1,3-dioxolane (poly-DOL) networks formed by ring-opening polymerization of 1,3-dioxolane/ethylene carbonate (EC) mixtures by a commonly used LiPF6 electrolyte salt. The complex kinetics of the DOL polymerization reaction in EC results in nonlinear phase behavior, including the appearance of a critical transition to an entangled, solid-like electrolyte state at 40% DOL. The transition is mediated by a range of physicochemical regimes-from liquid-like solutions to highly viscous conducting gels. We show that poly-DOL/EC electrolytes with a high concentration of the DOL precursor exhibit improved electrochemical stability compared to conventional DOL-based electrolytes, while maintaining good room temperature ionic conductivity. We show further that the EC component imparts oxidative stability, enabling their use in rechargeable, room-temperature Li parallel to LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 electrochemical cells.

Although TiO2 materials with amorphous (A-TiO2) and single-phase crystalline structures (C-TiO2) have been separately explored, the study to compare the fundamental electrochemistry of A-TiO2 and C-TiO2 is limited. In this work, we investigated A-TiO2 and C-TiO2 nanoparticles with identical chemical composition and morphology. C-TiO2 exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance than A-TiO2 in terms of rate capability and cycle life. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis suggests reversible Na ion insertion/extraction in C-TiO2. However, such process is irreversible in the case of A-TiO2. The charge storage mechanisms in both samples were studied to show that diffusion-controlled intercalation process becomes significant in C-TiO2 sample. The C-TiO2 sample has a better Na+ diffusivity measured through the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) compared to A-TiO2, which corroborates well with the rate capability study. Furthermore, the evolution of local structure of the TiO2 samples was analyzed by ex situ pair distribution function (PDF) to understand the variation in electrochemical properties. It reveals that the corner-shared Ti-Ti distance along Na ion diffusion pathway increases with the increase of crystallinity, leading to the expanded diffusion channels and therefore more active sites and faster diffusion.

Experimental and computational electrochemistry of quinazolinespirohexadienone molecular switches - differential electrochromic vs photochromic behavior	BEILSTEIN JOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article						cyclic voltammetry; density functional theory; heterocycles; molecular switches; photochromic photooxidants; spirocycles	CHAIN CYCLOADDITION POLYMERIZATION; ISOMERIZATION; POTENTIALS; CARBAZOLE	Our undergraduate research group has long focused on the preparation and investigation of electron-deficient analogs of the perimidinespirohexadienone (PSHD) family of photochromic molecular switches for potential application as "photochromic photooxidants" for gating sensitivity to photoinduced charge transfer. We previously reported the photochemistry of two closely related and more reducible quinazolinespirohexadienones (QSHDs), wherein the naphthalene of the PSHD is replaced with a quinoline. In the present work, we report our investigation of the electrochemistry of these asymmetric QSHDs. In addition to the short wavelength and photochromic long-wavelength isomers, we have found that a second, distinct long-wavelength isomer is produced electrochemically. This different long-wavelength isomer arises from a difference in the regiochemistry of spirocyclic ring-opening. The structures of both long-wavelength isomers were ascertained by cyclic voltammetry and H-1 NMR analyses, in concert with computational modeling. These results are compared to those for the symmetric parent PSHD, which due to symmetry possesses only a single possible regioisomer upon either electrochemical or photochemical ring-opening. Density functional theory calculations of bond lengths, bond orders, and molecular orbitals allow the rationalization of this differential photochromic vs electrochromic behavior of the QSHDs.

The recent discovery of the trans-cleavage property of CRISPR type V effectors makes CRISPR a potential high-accuracy bio-recognition tool. Herein, a CRISPR-Cas12a (cpf1) based electrochemical biosensor (E-CRISPR) is reported, which is more cost-effective and portable than optical-transduction-based biosensors. Through optimizing the in vitro trans-cleavage activity of Cas12a, E-CRIPSR was used to detect viral nucleic acids, including human papillomavirus 16 (HPV-16) and parvovirus B19 (PB-19), with a picomolar sensitivity. An aptamer-based E-CRISPR cascade was further designed for the detection of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) protein in clinical samples. As demonstrated, E-CRISPR could enable the development of portable, accurate, and cost-effective point-of-care diagnostic systems.

Mechanical collapse as primary degradation mode in mandrel-free 18650 Li-ion cells operated at 0 degrees C	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Low temperature; Mechanical deformation; X-ray micro CT; Accelerated rate calorimetry; Loss of lithium inventory; Loss of active material; Battery safety; Sub-ambient; Mandrel; Lithium plating	THERMAL RUNAWAY; LITHIUM; CAPACITY; BATTERY; TEMPERATURE; TOMOGRAPHY; ISSUES; FADE	Low temperature charging of Li-ion batteries threatens undesired deposition of lithium dendrites which are often blamed for catastrophic, thermal runaway failures. This work identifies three distinct degradation modes experienced by 0 degrees C operated 18650 Li-ion batteries, revealing safety and performance risks beyond lithium plating. Two equivalently rated (2.6Ah) commercial cells from different vendors, one possessing a mandrel and one lacking, were cycled at 0 degrees C. Through a combination of techniques, it is identified that the first degradation mode is dominated by cell polarization at low temperature, causing lower coulombic efficiency and undesired side reactions. Next, mechanical deformation or jellyroll collapse occurs, followed by accelerated metal plating. However, in the mandrel-containing cell, physical constraint of the electrodes prevents both the deformation and metal plating modes. These degradation modes, difficult to isolate with electrochemistry alone, were diagnosed with non-destructive micro X-ray computed tomography and destructive physical analysis and confirmed with differential capacity assessment. The implication of the physical conditions induced by 0 degrees C operation on cell safety was assessed with accelerated rate calorimetry. Our observations emphasize the presence of thermo-mechano-electrochemical interplay in commercial cells operated in extreme conditions and assesses the safety implications of their coupling.

The sensor is designed to easily integrate into the flow environment. Noble metal inks on Low Temperature Co-fired Ceramic provide straight forward fabrication at the mesoscale yielding robust sensors with very low sensing volumes. Two different sensor geometries were modeled. The best design was fabricated and tested in both static and flowing solutions. The sensor exhibits both macroelectrode and microelectrode behavior depending on fluid flow rate. Sensors of this type may be ideal for applications where electrochemical detection is desired in a flowing solution since the ring electrode has low propensity for bubble trapping.

By a decrease in the steric bulk around the diruthenium axial sites and an increase in the basicity of the bridging ligands, the first examples of bisaryl diruthenium(III) paddlewheel complexes have been isolated. Compounds of the form Ru-2(DMBA)(4)Ar-2 (DMBA = N,N'-dimethylbenzamidinate, Ar = C6H4-4-Bu-t (1), C6H5 (2), C6H3-3,5-(OCH3)(2) (3)) were synthesized via a lithium-halogen exchange reaction between Ru-2(DMBA)(4)Cl-2 and excess LiAr and characterized using mass spectrometry, electronic absorption spectroscopy, cyclic and differential pulse voltammetry, and H-1 NMR spectroscopy. The molecular structures of compounds 1-3 were established using single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis and their electronic structures (both ground and excited state) analyzed using density functional theory calculations.

In this work, we determine the nature and evolution over time of surface chemical species obtained after water-mediated redox reactions on Pb(Zr-0.2,Ti-0.8)O-3 thin films with opposite as-grown polarization states. Starting with intrinsically different surface chemical composition on the oppositely polarized films (as a result of their ferroelectric-dominated interaction with environmental water), we identify the reversible and irreversible electrochemical reactions under an external electric field, distinguishing switching and charging events. We find that while reversible ionic displacements upon polarization switching dominate screening in the bulk of the sample, polarization dependent irreversible redox reactions determine surface chemical composition, which reveals itself as a characteristic fingerprint of the ferroelectric polarization switching history.

Recently, research has been also focusing on the doping of metal nanoclusters through introduction of noble metals, such as platinum, and less noble metals, such as cadmium and mercury. Previous studies, which relied extensively on the use of mass spectrometry and single-crystal X-ray crystallography, led to the assignment of the location of each of these foreign-metal atoms. Our study provides new insights into this topic and, particularly, compelling evidence about the actual position of the selected metal atoms M = Pt, Pd, Hg, and Cd in the structure of Au24M(SR)(18)(0). To make sure that the results were not dependent on the thiolate, for SR we used both butanethiolate and phenylethanethiolate. The clusters were prepared according to different literature procedures that were supposed to lead to different doping positions. Use of NMR spectroscopy and isotope effects, with the support of mass spectrometry, electrochemistry, and single-crystal X-ray crystallography, led us to confirm that noble metals indeed dope the cluster at its central position, whereas no matter how the doping reaction is conducted and the nature of the ligand, the position of both Cd and Hg is always on the icosahedron shell, rather than at the central or staple position, as often reported. Our results not only provide a reassessment of previous conclusions, but also highlight the importance of NMR spectroscopy studies and cast doubts on drawing conclusions mostly based on single-crystal X-ray crystallography.

The physical origin of the observed anion redox remains debatable, and more direct experimental evidence is needed. In this work, we have shown electronic signatures of oxygen-oxygen coupling, direct evidence central to lattice oxygen redox (O2-/(O-2)(n-)), in charged Li2-xRuO3 after Ru oxidation (Ru-4(+)/Ru5+) upon first electron removal with lithium deintercalation. Experimental Ru L-3-edge high-energy-resolution fluorescence-detected X-ray absorption spectra (HERFD-XAS), supported by ab initio simulations, revealed that the increased intensity in the high-energy shoulder upon lithium deintercalation resulted from increased O-O coupling, inducing (O-O) sigma*-like states with pi overlap with Ru d-manifolds, in agreement with O K-edge XAS spectra. Experimental and simulated O K-edge X-ray emission spectra further supported this observation with the broadening of the oxygen nonbonding feature upon charging, also originated from (O-O) sigma* states. This lattice oxygen redox of Li2-xRuO3 was accompanied by a small amount of O-2 evolution in the first charge from differential electrochemistry mass spectrometry but diminished in the subsequent cycles, in agreement with the more reduced states of Ru in later cycles from Ru L-3-edge HERFD-XAS. These observations indicated that Ru redox contributed more to discharge capacities after the first cycle. This study has pinpointed the key spectral fingerprints related to lattice oxygen redox from a molecular level and constructed a transferrable framework to rationally interpret the spectroscopic features by combining advanced experiments and theoretical calculations to design materials for Li-ion batteries and electrocatalysis applications.

Similarly, reaction of [ThCl4(DME)(2)] (DME = 1,2-dimethoxyethane) with 6 equiv of Li(N=(CBuPh)-Bu-t) in tetrahydrofuran affords the isostructural Th(IV) ketimide [Li](2)[Th(N=(CBuPh)-Bu-t)(6)] (2), which can be isolated in 53% yield after workup. Both 1 and 2 were fully characterized, including analysis by X-ray crystallography, allowing for a detailed structural and spectroscopic comparison. The electronic structures of 1 and 2 were also explored with density functional theory and multiconfigurational wave function calculations. Additionally, the redox chemistry of 1 was probed by cyclic voltammetry, which revealed a highly cathodic Ce(IV)/Ce(III) reduction potential, providing evidence for the ability of the ketimide ligand to stabilize high oxidation states of the lanthanides.

J	Zeszut, R; Landau, U				Zeszut, Ronald; Landau, Uziel			Determination of Redox Currents in Electroless Systems: Correct Application of Mixed Potential Analysis	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							COPPER DEPOSITION; GLYOXYLIC-ACID; KINETICS; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; MECHANISMS; CORROSION	Electroless processes have traditionally been modeled by way of the 'mixed potential theory', stipulating that the electroless process operates at a potential where the anodic and cathodic currents are of equal magnitude. The latter are typically measured in separate systems, with compositions similar to the process chemistry, however, absent either the oxidized or the reduced species. While valid for some processes, this application of the mixed potential theory fails in many others. A new method for characterizing electroless processes is presented here. Applying external current to the complete electroless chemistry, both the oxidation and reduction processes proceed in parallel, via the external current and through the electroless process. Monitoring the external current and the amount of deposited metal, the correct anodic and cathodic polarization curves in the actual system are determined and applied to the mixed potential theory. Using this method, excellent agreement was found in characterizing the process of electroless copper reduction by glyoxylic acid, a system which the classical mixed potential theory fails to correlate. Although applied here just to the copper-glyoxylic acid system, this technique for generating polarization curves in complete electroless systems is general and can be extended to other electroless and redox processes.

Previous DFT-based calculations show that the catalytic properties of the Pd surface could be altered by modifying its electronic properties. However, only a few experimental studies investigate how the electronic properties of Pd are modified by introducing various metals and how the resulting electronic perturbation affects its electrochemical activity and stability for FAO. Here, we demonstrate a correlation between electrochemistry and electronic properties for Pd-M bimetallic nanoparticles (M = Ru, Pt, Cu, Au, and Ag). The volcano shape relationship obtained between activity and d-band center values suggests that the electronic effects play a major role in modifying the surface electrochemical properties of Pd-M bimetallic nanoparticles for FAO. Among all the bimetallic catalysts investigated in this study, Pd-Pt/C and Pd-Cu/C with d-band center values of 2.58 eV and 2.85 eV, respectively, demonstrate the highest activities and Pd-Cu/C exhibits the highest stability for FAO.

The Pt(111) facet is the most representative model mimicking Pt nanoparticles and polycrystals for fundamental studies. Herein, we propose a site-specific model accompanied with the typical elementary steps of the electrochemistry of Pt(111) in non-adsorbing electrolyte within the potential range between 0.05 and 1.15 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Simulations were conducted at different scanning rates based on the kinetics models. We reproduce all the anodic and cathodic peaks observed in the reported experimental curves. These results demonstrate the underlying mechanisms of the peak formation in different potential regions.

The geometry and chemistry of architected materials can be engineered to address key areas of performance, including electrochemical kinetics and mechanics. Electrochemical kinetics impact key metrics such as power density, efficiency, and lifetime in batteries, fuel cells, and sensors. Additionally, electrochemical reactions can dramatically change material composition, which may result in large strains (in the hundreds of percent) that cause mechanical failure. In this article, we summarize advances in energy storage offered by architected materials and highlight fabrication methods used to realize these advances. We also discuss electrochemistry as an enabling tool for architected materials with functionality beyond energy storage and sensing.

The electrochemical methods of Fe3O4 in NaCl-CaCl2 melts are studied by cyclic voltammetry, square wave voltammetry and open-circuit chronopotentiometry. The effects of temperature on reduction potential and peak current are investigated. The diffusion coefficients of Fe3+ and Fe2+ at different temperatures are calculated, and the activation energy E is obtained. Electrolytic products are obtained after 10 min of potentiostatic electrolysis in the melts of NaCl-CaCl2-Fe3O4 at 1073 K and 1.9 V. The results of XRD show that no other compounds are formed in the melts, indicating that Fe3O4 do not react chemically in the NaCl-CaCl2 melts system at 973 K, which is consistent with the theoretical analysis. Fe3O4 is reduced by two-step quasi-reversible reaction in the melts of NaCl-CaCl2 at 973 K to obtain iron: Fe3+. Fe2+. Fe. The two-step reaction is controlled by diffusion. The diffusion coefficients are 4.53 x 10(-6) cm(2).s(-1) and 1.17 x 10(-6) cm(2).s(-1), respectively. Fe3O4 is reduced in two steps. The potential shifts with temperature and decreases with the increase of the proportion of Fe3O4. The activation energies of the two-step reaction are 62.38 kJ.mol(-1) and 77.52 kJ.mol(-1). A deposited layer of uniform distribution, high coverage and dense iron is prepared.

The polymer was characterized by SEM, TEM, FT-IR and Raman techniques. The newly formed material exhibited reversible electrochemical activity in the negative potential range due to the reduction of fullerene cages with an overall electrochemical behavior resembling that of typical organic conducting polymers. The electron density of states calculated using DFT method clearly confirmed the fullerene cage reduction via electron transfer from the low-lying SLGO states. Therefore, coordination polymers of fullerene moieties bonded to the graphene sheets are easier to reduce in comparison to the coordination polymers of pristine C60. In addition, the spectroscopic and electrochemical properties of SLGO-php-C-60/Pd hybrid polymeric material were also compared with php-C-60/Pd polymer and SLGO-php-C-60 hybrid films to seek film morphologyproperty relations.

Two studies comparing students' explanations of an oxidation-reduction reaction after viewing a single computer animation: the effect of varying the complexity of visual images and depicting water molecules	CHEMISTRY EDUCATION RESEARCH AND PRACTICE			English	Article							HIGH-SCHOOL-STUDENTS; MENTAL MODELS; SYMBOLIC REPRESENTATIONS; EFFECTIVELY SUBSTITUTE; SEDUCTIVE DETAILS; SPATIAL ABILITY; CHEMISTRY; MISCONCEPTIONS; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; CONCEPTIONS	This paper describes two studies comparing students' explanations of an oxidation-reduction reaction after viewing the chemical demonstration and one of two different particulate-level computer animations. In the first study, the two animations differed primarily in the complexity of the visual images. Students viewing the more simplified animation provided more correct explanations regarding the identity of water and nitrate ions in the animations, the absence of ion pairs, the correct ratios of silver to nitrate ions and silver ions to copper atoms, the electron transfer process, size changes in the atoms and ions as the reaction occurred, the source of blue colour in solution, and the driving force for the reaction. Students viewing the more simplified animation also wrote more correct balanced chemical equations for the reaction compared to students viewing the more complex animation. Students in the first study also noted that the more simplified animation did not depict extraneous information (camera angle changes, the overabundance of water molecules), and did depict relevant information (atom and ion charges, the number of electrons transferred, the source of the blue colour). In the second study, the two animations differed only by whether water molecules were shown or omitted from the animation. Students' explanations for most concepts were similar for these two groups of students; however, students viewing the animation with water molecules omitted were better able to identify nitrate ions in the animation. The only difference the students in the second study noticed between the two animations is the presence or absence of water molecules, but these student did not agree as to whether showing or omitting water molecules was more beneficial. The results of the two studies together suggest that showing or omitting water molecules in the animations had a limited effect on students' explanations of the oxidation-reduction process.

Comparing the influence of visualization type in an electrochemistry laboratory on the student discourse: who do they talk to and what do they say?	CHEMISTRY EDUCATION RESEARCH AND PRACTICE			English	Article							CHEMICAL EDUCATION RESEARCH; SCIENCE-EDUCATION; CONCEPTUAL CHANGE; CHEMISTRY; REPRESENTATIONS; MISCONCEPTIONS; ANIMATION; FLOW	A laboratory is a large investment of time and money for departments of chemistry yet discussions continue about its purpose in the educational process. Helping students navigate the three levels of representation; macroscopic, particulate and symbolic is a potential use of this time. This study looked at two different types of visualization for an electrochemistry laboratory in second semester general chemistry and the impact that the visualization type had on the student discourse. Macroscopic visualization (MV) was accomplished through a traditional hands-on laboratory and particulate visualization (PV) was achieved using a computer simulation featuring animated electrons and ions. The type of visualization impacted how much the students talked, who they talked to, and what they talked about. The MV students engaged in less peer-to-peer discussion than the PV students. The MV students expressed more excitement about their observations and were more focused on getting the data quickly. The MV spent most of their time physically doing the laboratory work while spending little time discussing the concepts. The PV students spent more time talking about concepts with their peers especially at the particulate level even answering macroscopic questions with particulate explanations. The type of visualization influenced all aspects of the student discourse.

Electrochemical characterization of natural organic matter by direct voltammetry in an aprotic solvent	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS			English	Article							RESOLUTION MASS-SPECTROMETRY; COLLISION-INDUCED DISSOCIATION; ELECTRON-TRANSFER REACTIVITY; AQUATIC HUMIC SUBSTANCES; SOLID-PHASE EXTRACTION; MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION; SPECTROSCOPIC CHARACTERIZATION; AQUEOUS ELECTROCHEMISTRY; REDUCTION POTENTIALS; MICROBIAL REDUCTION	The complex and indeterminant composition of NOM makes characterization of its redox properties challenging. Approaches that have been taken to address this challenge include chemical probe reactions, potentiometric titrations, chronocoulometry, and voltammetry. In this study, we revisit the use of direct voltammetric methods in aprotic solvents by applying an expanded and refined suite of methods to a large set of NOM samples and model compounds (54 NOM samples from 10 different sources, 7 NOM model compounds, and 2 fresh extracts of plant materials that are high in redox-active quinonoid model compounds dissolved in DMSO). Refinements in the methods of fitting the data obtained by staircase cyclic voltammetry (SCV) provided improved definition of peaks, and square wave voltammetry (SWV), performed under the same conditions as SCV, provided even more reliable identification and quantitation of peaks. Further evidence is provided that DMSO improves the electrode response by unfolding some of the tertiary structure of NOM polymers, thereby allowing greater contact between redox active functional groups and the electrode surface. We averaged experimental peak potentials for all NOM compounds and calculated potentials in water. Average values for E-pa1, E-pc1, and E-p1 in DMSO were -0.866 +/- 0.069, -1.35 +/- 0.071, and -0.831 +/- 0.051 V vs. Ag/Ag+, and -0.128, -0.613, and -0.0930 V vs. SHE in water. In addition to peak potentials, the breadth of SCV peaks was quantified as a way to characterize the degree to which the redox activity of NOM is due to a continuum of contributing functional groups. The average breadth values were 1.63 +/- 0.24, 1.28 +/- 0.34, and 0.648 +/- 0.15 V for E-pa1, E-pc1, and E-p1 respectively. Comparative analysis of the overall dataset-from SCV and SWV on all NOMs and model compounds-revealed that NOM redox properties vary over a narrower range than expected based on model compound properties. This lack of diversity in redox properties of NOM is similar to conclusions from other recent work on the molecular structure of NOM, all of which could be the result of selectivity in the common extraction methods used to obtain the materials.

This process allows unprecedented flexibility in integrating highly distinct materials with atomic/molecular precision to produce a new generation of organic/inorganic superlattices with tunable chemical, electronic, and optical properties. To better understand the intercalation process, we developed an on-chip platform based on MoS2 model devices and used optical, electrochemical, and in situ electronic characterizations to resolve the intermediate stages during the intercalation process and monitor the evolution of the molecular superlattices. With sufficient charge injection, the organic cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) intercalation induces the phase transition of MoS2 from semiconducting 2H phase to semimetallic IT phase, resulting in a dramatic increase of electrical conductivity. Therefore, in situ monitoring the evolution of the device conductance reveals the electrochemical intercalation dynamics with an abrupt conductivity change, signifying the onset of the molecule intercalation. In contrast, the intercalation of tetraheptylammonium bromide (THAB), a branched molecule in a larger size, resulting in a much smaller number of charges injected to avoid the 2H to IT phase transition. Our study demonstrates a powerful platform for in situ monitoring the molecular intercalation of many 2DLMs (MoS2, WSe2, ReS2, PdSe2, TiS2, and graphene) and systematically probing electronic, optical, and optoelectronic properties at the single-nanosheet level.

Despite substantial studies, the atomistic observation of the interfacial ionic transport and electrochemical reactions occurring between the solid-state electrodes is lacking. Here, in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is used to deliberately design an unusual sample configuration, enabling dynamic observation of the sodium ionic transport within a single-crystal nanostructure and between different few-layer phosphorene nanosheets. An unhindered and reversible ionic shuttling between few-layer phosphorene is directly observed in real time. In addition, it is found that sodium transport kinetics are closely related to the interface orientation and the intimate contact between solid electrodes plays a significant role in inhibiting dendrite growth. Furthermore, by fast TEM imaging with approximate to 40 ms resolution a unique stripe-like sodium transport behavior is observed in phosphorene, and the multiple sodium ionic transport pathways at the interfaces with atomic spatial resolution are revealed. This work may supply enlightening insights into understanding the solid-solid interfacial electrochemistry between electrode materials.

Power of the Secondary Sphere: Modulating Hydrogenase Activity in Nickel-Substituted Rubredoxin	ACS CATALYSIS			English	Article						hydrogen production; artificial metalloenzyme; protein film electrochemistry; outer-sphere effects; electrocatalysis	OUTER COORDINATION SPHERE; PROTON-TRANSFER PATHWAY; H-2 OXIDATION CATALYST; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; CYTOCHROME-C; REDUCTION POTENTIALS; MAGNETIC-PROPERTIES; CARBON ELECTRODES; NIFE HYDROGENASE; AMINO-ACIDS	Secondary sphere interactions are known to significantly impact catalytic rates within biological systems as well as synthetic molecular catalysts. The [NiFe] hydrogenase enzymes oxidize and produce molecular hydrogen at high turnover rates within a complex coordination environment. Nickel-substituted rubredoxin (NiRd) has been developed as a functional, protein-based mimic of the [NiFe] hydrogenase, providing an opportunity to understand the influence of the secondary coordination environment on proton reduction activity. In this work, a rationally designed series of mutants was generated to study the effects of outer-sphere interactions on catalysis. This library was characterized using quantitative protein film electrochemistry, optical spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and molecular dynamics simulations. Changing the secondary sphere residues modulates the redox activity of the nickel- and iron-bound rubredoxin proteins, alters the hydrogen-bonding network, and perturbs solvent accessibility of the active site, which correlates with catalytic turnover frequency. The effects on reactivity are dependent on the site of mutation and, when coupled to crystallographic and computational analyses, implicate one of the nickel-coordinating cysteine residues as the mechanistically relevant site of protonation. Introduction of a carboxylate residue, mimicking that found in the [NiFe] hydrogenase, significantly increases the overall catalytic rate, likely through installation of a proton transfer pathway into the active site. Apparent turnover frequencies within the mutant constructs range from 15 to 500 s(-1) without imparting significant variation in overpotential, and many mutants break the typical scaling relationship between catalytic rates and overpotential that is often seen in small-molecule systems. These results demonstrate the substantial impact of the coordination environment on the hydrogen-producing activity of the artificial metalloenzyme, NiRd, and highlight the importance of such interactions within molecular catalysts.

Restricted volumes found in thin films and droplets have been shown to control reduction reaction kinetics and are an ongoing challenge to characterize and standardize. This, along with the dynamic and high concentration of aggressive ions found in confined electrolytes, creates a unique corrosion system that requires a multifaceted approach to evaluate varied conditions, compare them with traditional measurements, and more accurately predict galvanic atmospheric corrosion. In this work, corrosion currents in galvanic couples were obtained under two environmental conditions: (1) bulk electrolytes, in a standardized test configuration, with chemistries relevant to atmospheric electrolytes; and (2) deliquesced droplets formed and equilibrated at a given temperature and relative humidity value. The corrosion currents for the same galvanic couple specimens were evaluated, using an atmospheric corrosion model, under a thin film electrolyte while statically loaded and unloaded, at two nominally different locations, e.g. Alexandria, VA, and Miami, FL, on the same date, using recorded weather conditions. The modeled corrosion currents were then compared with the currents obtained from the experimental conditions.

Top-down analysis of disulfide-linked proteins using photoinduced radical reactions and ET-DDC	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MASS SPECTROMETRY			English	Article						Top-down tandem mass spectrometry; Disulfide bond reduction; Electron transfer dissociation; ET-DDC	ELECTRON-CAPTURE DISSOCIATION; HEAT-INDUCED REDISTRIBUTION; PHASE ION/ION REACTIONS; QUADRUPOLE ION-TRAP; BOND-CLEAVAGE; COLLISIONAL ACTIVATION; PROTONATED PEPTIDES; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; MILK-PROTEINS; ELECTROCHEMISTRY	Top-down characterization of proteins via tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) can be challenging due to the presence of multiple disulfide bond linkages; which significantly inhibit the backbone cleavage efficiency for the formation of structurally informative fragment ions. In this study, we present a strategy of pairing a solution-phase photoinitiating system with dipolar direct current induced collisional activation of electron transfer products (ET-DDC) of proteins for a top-down MS/MS approach. The photoinitiating system allows for a rapid scission of all the disulfide linkages in the protein (on the time scale of seconds) with high efficiency (near to complete reduction); while ET-DDC collisional activation improves the fragmentation efficiency for the protein via broadband activation of all the first-generation charge reduced precursor ions (e.g., electron transfer no-dissociation or ETnoD products) from electron transfer reactions over a wide mass-to-charge range. As a result, this approach enabled the generation of extensive sequence informative fragment ion yields for a rapid and enhanced structural characterization of disulfide-linked proteins.

Creating Faradaic Carbon Nanotube Electrodes with Mild Chemical Oxidation	BATTERIES & SUPERCAPS			English	Article						electrochemistry; heterogeneous catalysis; carbon nanotubes; supercapacitors; oxidation	ELECTRICAL ENERGY-STORAGE; SUPERCAPACITOR ELECTRODES; PERFORMANCE; BATTERY; DENSITY; POLYMER; LIMITS	The development of new materials to improve interfacial charge transfer characteristics will drastically improve energy storage, heterogeneous catalysis, and many other electrochemical applications. Here, we report a simple procedure that can harness the Faradaic nature of residual iron nanoparticle catalysts that endure within multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) post-synthesis, thereby alleviating the challenges associated with forging hybrid nanocomposite electrodes. Non-purified MWNTs, undergo a chemical oxidation process in acidic conditions with KMnO4 to partially "unzip" the MWNTs and expose the redox-active iron nanoparticles to the electrolyte. A stable redox peak associated with the Fe2+/3+ transition is achieved during the MWNT oxidation process yielding a similar to 350 % increase in capacitance (>300 F g(-1)) relative to purified MWNT electrodes (70 F g(-1)). While these materials solely may be pragmatic as energy storage electrodes, the integration of redox species within an inert carbon electrode will also provide new opportunities to accelerate heterogeneous charge transfer reactions.

Synthesis, structural, electrochemical and spectroscopic characterization, and theoretical calculations of two new Cu(II) and Ni(II) complexes from 2-(1-((pyridine-2-ylmethyl)imino)ethyl)naphtalen-1-ol	JOURNAL OF COORDINATION CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Schiff base ligand; electrochemistry; non-innocent ligand; X-ray diffraction; metal complexes	SCHIFF-BASE; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURES; COPPER(II) COMPLEXES; X-RAY; STATE; BOND; POTENTIALS; LIGANDS; BINDING; IONS	We present the synthesis of the tridentate Schiff base 2-(1-((pyridine-2-ylmethyl)imino)ethyl)naphtalen-1-ol (LH) providing a NNO coordination environment. Two new Ni(II) and Cu(II) complexes with a ligand to metal stoichiometric ratio of 1:1 and 2:1, respectively, were synthesized from LH. The Cu(II) complex of general formula [Cu(L)(MeOH)](ClO4)?MeOH (2) has a square planar geometry in the central ion completed by a MeOH molecule. In the case of the mononuclear Ni(II) complex [NiL2]?MeOH (3) the central ion has a distorted octahedral geometry. These new compounds were structurally, spectroscopically and electrochemically characterized using X-ray diffraction, UV-vis, IR, H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR spectroscopies, and cyclic voltammetry. LH is electroactive in the potential window of ?1.0 to 1.0?V with one irreversible oxidation at 0.44?V, a quasi-reversible oxidation at 0.60?V, and one irreversible reduction at 0.24?V. For 2, there is a quasi-reversible oxidation at 0.43?V and one irreversible oxidation at 0.64?V. Complex 3 has two quasi-reversible oxidations at 0.19?V and at 0.58?V, one irreversible oxidation at 0.37?V, and one irreversible reduction at 0.38?V. DFT calculations were undertaken to obtain optimized structures and relative stability for 2 and 3 and their intermediates. [GRAPHICS] .

Core-shell nanoscale heterostructures offer high precision when replacing redox-active ions on the surface with inactive species such as Al ions to suppress these deleterious reactions. However, the level of compositional complexity of leading cathodes for high-energy devices, while showing increased stability, remains to be demonstrated for these heterostructures. A combination of colloidal synthesis and subsequent post-annealing process was used to produce cores of LiCo0.5Ni0.25Mn0.25O2, a layered oxide with a high theoretical capacity, with epitaxial and conformal shells with increasing concentration of Al from the interior to surface. Thorough insight at high chemical and spatial resolution was obtained by a combination of characterization techniques. The gradient of Al was controlled by the initial content and the temperature of synthesis. The passivation layers play a critical role in notably increasing the retention of capacity, which was particularly considerable under harsh conditions such as wide potential window and, especially, elevated temperature, which accelerate side reactions. Spectroscopic analysis revealed that the tailored surface layers mainly stabilized the electronic environment at the surface, suggesting a possible explanation to the improved battery performance.

NANO ENERGY			English	Article						Triboelectric nanogenerators; Self-powered system; Heavy metal treatment; Pulsed direct current; Maximize removal efficiency	HEAVY-METAL IONS; ELECTROCOAGULATION EC; EFFICIENT REMOVAL; CR(VI); CHLORIDE; QUALITY; ENERGY; PH	Electrochemical techniques have been extensively applied to treat heavy metal pollution in our daily life. Traditional electrochemistry is always driven by continuous DC (CDC), but the energy harvested in environment from water using nanogenerator is always a pulsed DC (PDC). The question is if the CDC has a better performance than PDC? Here, we systematically investigated the electrochemical performance of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) removal from wasted as powered by pulsed output of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) using the energy harvested from environment. By optimizing the frequency and on-off ratio of PDC, the removal efficiency of Cr(VI) can be maximally enhanced by 53.5% compared to that driven by a CDC under equal amount of electric charges, which is further confirmed by electrochemical experiments driven by layered TENG. The reason is the more production of Fe2+, the better utilization of Fe2+, and the higher ion diffusion rate during the process driven by PDC, where the electrode passivation caused by concentration polarization of the anode region and over potential is reduced. Besides, a self-powered system is designed for removing contaminant from wastewater by harvesting energy from the flowing water through rotary-TENG, where heavy metal pollutant such as Cr(VI) can be sufficiently and continuously removed. This study demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of self-powered electrochemical for cleaning environment pollution using the harvested energy.

Irreversibility at macromolecular scales in the flake graphite of the lithium-ion battery anode	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Graphite intercalation compounds; Lithium-ion battery; In situ; Optical microscopy; Electrochemistry; Microcrystals	IN-SITU; INTERCALATION COMPOUNDS; LI-INTERCALATION; ELECTRODES; LITHIATION; DIFFUSION	Charging a commercial lithium-ion battery intercalates lithium into the graphite-based anode, creating various lithium carbide structures. Despite their economic importance, these structures and the dynamics of their charging-discharging transitions are not well-understood. We have videoed single microcrystals of high-quality, natural graphite undergoing multiple lithiation-delithation cycles. Because the equilibrium lithium-carbide compounds corresponding to full, half, and one-third charge are gold, red, and blue respectively, video observations give direct insight into both the macromolecular structures and the kinematics of charging and discharging. We find that the transport during the first lithiation is slow and orderly, and follows the core-shell or shrinking annuli model with phase boundaries moving at constant velocities (i.e. non-diffusively). Subsequent lithiations are markedly different, showing transport that is both faster and disorderly, which indicates that the initially pristine graphite is irreversibly and considerably altered during the first cycle. In all cases deintercalation is not the time-reverse of intercalation. These findings both illustrate how lithium enters nearly defect-free host material, and highlight the differences between the idealized case and an actual, cycling graphite anode.

Electrocatalytic effects during redox reactions of arsenic at platinum nanoparticles in acid medium: Possibility of preconcentration, electroactive film formation, and detection of As(III) and As(V)	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Pt nanoparticles; Electrocatalysis Inert redox systems; Electrochemistry of arsenic(III) and arsenic(V); Arsenate adsorbates and films	GLASSY-CARBON ELECTRODE; ELECTROCHEMICAL DETECTION; SURFACE MODIFICATION; GOLD NANOPARTICLES; OXIDATION; VOLTAMMETRY; SPECIATION; REDUCTION; NITRITE; OXIDE	Platinum nanoparticles, when deposited on an inert electrode substrate, exhibit electrocatalytic properties during both oxidation of As(III) and reduction of As(V) in acid medium (0.5 mol dm(-3) H2SO4). Upon application of the appropriate potential, both As(III) and As(V) are preconcentrated on surfaces of Pt nanoparticles. Consequently, their presence can monitored under voltammetric conditions. The nature of arsenic stripping voltammetric peaks is strongly dependent on the preconcentration potential. While the reduction and deposition of As(III) is induced by adsorbed hydrogen on Pt formed at potentials lower than 0.25 V (vs. RHE), the adsorption and preconcentration of As(V) can be readily achieved at Pt oxides generated at Pt nanoparticles at potentials higher than 0.85 V (vs. RHE). From mechanistic point of view, voltammetric oxidation of bulk As(III) is catalyzed by Pt oxo species but electrocatalytic reduction of As(V) requires its prior adsorption. Electroreduction of the resulting As(V) adsorbates is catalyzed by both metallic platinum and by platinum on which hydrogen atoms are adsorbed; the resulting voltammetric peak current densities are dependent on concentration of As(V) in solution. A unique feature of the preconcentrated As(III) and As(V) oxo species is the ability to agglomerate and form stable redox-polymer-like polynuclear-electroactive-films on Pt nanoparticles. Their performance resembles the behavior of redox conducting polymers, and their redox transitions are fast and reversible with the electron self-exchange rate reaching 8.10(6) dm(3) mol(-1) s(-1). Under such conditions, the stripping type voltammetric currents are enhanced. Electrochemical experiments are supported by the data from scanning and transmission electron microscopies and Raman spectroscopy. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Evaluating ferrocene ions and all-ferrocene salts for electrochemical applications	JOURNAL OF ORGANOMETALLIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Ferrocene; Electrochemistry; X-ray structures; Metathesis; Solvent effect	REDOX-FLOW BATTERIES; ENERGY; ACID; CATION; SULFONATES; COMPLEXES; CHEMISTRY; STORAGE; BLOCK	The success of applications such as redox flow battery (RFB) technologies is highly dependent on the development of new molecular strategies, and much work has focused on the chemistry of ferrocene compounds as RFB components. This report presents four "all-ferrocene" salts comprised of ferrocene anions and cations and evaluates their solubility and electrochemical properties. The four salts are formed via metathesis reactions employing the (ferrocenemethyl) trimethylammonium cation and mono and bis sulfonate or carboxylate ferrocene anions. We observed that the potentials of the ferrocene components was not only dependent on the substituent, but also on the solvent medium. In particular, the sulfonate and carboxylate ferrocene anions exhibited significant shifts in redox potential between water, propylene carbonate (PC), and DMF. Most notably, in (ferrocenemethyl) trimethylammonium 1,1'-bis(sulfonato)ferrocene, the potentials of the cation and anion reverse, with the anion having a lower potential in aqueous solution and a more positive potential in organic media.

AC impedance analysis, absorption spectroscopy, and elemental composition via SEM-EDX support the formation of donor-acceptor (D-A) type alternating block copolymers, poly(T-3-TTDT2), and poly(T-3-DPPT2). Unique optical properties that span into the near infrared-II(>1000 nm) region and inherent electrical conductivity at the p-type regime, n-type regime, and in between the two regimes (i.e., typical insulator region) are observed. This study showcases the advantages of electro-polymerization toward tailoring of next generation opto-electronic materials.

In particular, alpha-MnO2 shows superior rate capability with silver stabilizing ions at the center of tunnels that improve electrical conductivity. In this work, we directly compare structural transformation of silver-containing alpha-MnO2 nanorods (Ag1.22Mn8O16-x or L-Ag-HOL and Ag1.66Mn8O16-y or H-Ag-HOL), containing higher and lower concentrations of oxygen vacancies respectively, by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The elaborate comparative and statistical TEM studies eliminate concerns regarding generalization errors and facilitate rational structural development of nanorods with improved functionality. It is found that sodium ions favorably diffuse through the area where oxygen vacancies are concentrated, and the samples with more silver ions and fewer oxygen vacancies (H-Ag-HOL) show more significant structural deformation with more inhomogeneous sodiation. The difference in functional electrochemistry coupled with the observed difference in inter- and intra-nanorod inhomogeneous structural evolution emphasizes the significance of the uniform electrical conductivity of the electrode. This work helps to improve the alpha-MnO2 electrode material for sodium-ion batteries as well as suggesting the importance of delicate statistical approaches for TEM investigations.

Indeed, they play a key role in peripheral functionalization reactions occurring at the macrocycle, enabling high-yield and regioselective group insertions useful to further elaborate the molecular skeleton. In parallel, the Janus innocent or noninnocent behavior of the corrole ligand in these complexes makes their description particularly challenging. Herein, we report properties for a series of silver 3,17-disubstituted triarylcorrole complexes with various functionalities (halogens or different phenylethynyl units) that deeply affect the electron density in the macrocyclic ligand, with obvious repercussions on the observed spectral characteristics. The compounds were obtained in yields of 54-92% by applying the Stille coupling reaction with the appropriate tributylethynyl stannane. Among the complexes prepared was a derivative bearing two terminal acetylenic units which opens the way to "click" reactions for new corrole-based architectures. This corrole was structurally characterized by single crystal X-ray crystallography. The addition of substituted ethynyl groups resulted in red-shifts of the electronic absorption spectra, the largest of which was observed for the compound with two beta-NO2-Ph-C=C substituents. The remarkable influence of the NO2 groups on the electron density of this macrocycle was further demonstrated by electrochemical measurements, where an easier reduction of this complex derivative was observed as compared to the others. DFT calculations showed full delocalization over the entire p-nitrophenylethynyl unit of 5, largely affecting orbital distributions and the corresponding electronic absorptions. Although a variation of the beta-substituents dramatically modifies the Soret- and Q-band positions towards lower energies for all the examined complexes, the saddling of the macrocycle resulting from functionalization is only moderate. The collected results suggest the description of these compounds as Ag-III-corrolate(3-), a metallocorrole with an innocent macrocyclic ligand.

Structural Origin of the Large Redox-Linked Reorganization in the 2-Oxoglutarate Dependent Oxygenase, TauD	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							TAURINE/ALPHA-KETOGLUTARATE DIOXYGENASE; ETHYLENE-FORMING ENZYME; ALPHA-KETOGLUTARATE; CONFORMATIONAL-CHANGES; SUBSTRATE-BINDING; FE(II); IRON; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; SPECTROSCOPY; MECHANISMS	2-Oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent oxygenases catalyze a wide range of chemical transformations via C-H bond activation. Prior studies raised the question of whether substrate hydroxylation by these enzymes occurs via a hydroxyl rebound or alkoxide mechanism and highlighted the need to understand the thermodynamic properties of transient intermediates. A recent spectroelectrochemical investigation of the 2OG-dependent oxygenase, taurine hydroxylase (TauD), revealed a strong link between the redox potential of the Fe(II)/Fe(III) couple and conformational changes of the enzyme. In this study, we show that the redox potential of wild-type TauD varies by 468 mV between the reduction of 2OG-Fe(III)-TauD (-272 mV) and oxidation of 2OG-Fe(II)-TauD (+196 mV). We use active site variants to investigate the structural origin of the redox-linked reorganization and the contributions of the metal-bound residues to the dynamic tuning of the redox potential of TauD. Time-dependent redox titrations show that reorganization occurs as a multistep process. Transient optical absorption and infrared spectroelectrochemistry show that substitution of any metal ligand alters the kinetics and thermodynamics of the reorganization. The H99A variant shows the largest net redox change relative to the wild-type protein, suggesting that redox-coupled protonation of H99 is required for high redox potentials of the metal. The D101Q and H25SQ variants also suppress the conformational change, supporting their involvement in the structural rearrangement. Similar redox-linked conformational changes are observed in another 2OG dependent oxygenase, ethylene-forming enzyme, indicating that dynamic structural flexibility and the associated thermodynamic tuning may be a common phenomenon in this family of enzymes.

Low-valent organometallic compounds are known to activate methane, but their electron-rich nature seems incompatible with O-2 and prevents catalytic air oxidation. We report selective oxidation of methane to methanol with an O-2-sensitive metalloradical as the catalyst and air as the oxidant at room temperature and ambient pressure. The incompatibility between C-H activation and O-2 oxidation is reconciled by electrochemistry and nanomaterials, with which a concentration gradient of O-2 within the nanowire array spatially segregated incompatible steps in the catalytic cycle. An unexpected 220 000-fold increase of the apparent reaction rate constants within the nanowire array leads to a turnover number up to 52 000 within 24 h. The synergy between nanomaterials and organometallic chemistry warrants a new catalytic route for CH4 functionalization.

However, suppressing the formation of potassium metal dendrites during cycling is pivotal in the development of future potassium metal-based battery technology. Herein, a promising artificial solid-electrolyte interphase (ASEI) design, simply covering a carbon nanotube (CNT) film on the surface of a potassium metal anode, is demonstrated. The results show that the spontaneously potassiated CNT framework with a stable self-formed solid-electrolyte interphase layer integrates a quasi-hosting feature with fast interfacial ion transport, which enables dendrite-free deposition of potassium at an ultrahigh capacity (20 mAh cm(-2)). Remarkably, the potassium metal anode exhibits an unprecedented cycle life (over 1000 cycles, over 2000 h) at a high current density of 5 mA cm(-2) and a desirable areal capacity of 4 mAh cm(-2). Dendrite-free morphology in carbon-fiber and carbon-black-based ASEI for potassium metal anodes, which indicates a broader promise of this approach, is also observed.

In this work we present results which characterize the ability to use functionalized graphene (via dopants B, N) to upshift and downshift the adsorption energy of mono-atomic oxygen, O-star (the ORR activity descriptor on ORR Volcano Plots), for various compositions of 4-atom, 7-atom, and 19-atom sub-nanometer binary alloy/intermetallic transition metal nanoparticle catalysts on graphene (TMNP-MDG). Our results show several important and interesting features: (1) that the combination of geometric and electronic effects makes development of simple linear mixing rules for size/composition difficult; (2) that the transition from 4- to 7- to 19-atom TMNP on MDG has pronounced effects on ORR activity for all compositions; (3) that the use of B and N as dopants to modulate the graphene-TMNP electronic structure interaction can cause shifts in the oxygen adsorption energy of 0.5 eV or more; (4) that it might be possible to make specific doped-graphene-NixCuy TMNP systems which fall close to the Volcano Peak for ORR. Our results point to systems which should be investigated experimentally and may improve the viability of future fuel cell or other ORR applications, and provide new paths for future investigations of more detail for TMNP-MDG screening.

Strongly Coupled Redox-Linked Conformational Switching at the Active Site of the Non-Heme Iron-Dependent Dioxygenase, TauD	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B			English	Article							TAURINE/ALPHA-KETOGLUTARATE DIOXYGENASE; ELECTRON-TRANSFER REACTIONS; ALPHA-KETOGLUTARATE; DIRECT ELECTROCHEMISTRY; INFRARED-SPECTROSCOPY; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; COPPER PROTEIN; HEME; ENZYMES; BINDING	2-Oxoglutarate (20G)-dependent dioxygenases catalyze C-H activation while performing a wide range of chemical transformations. In contrast to their heme analogues, non-heme iron centers afford greater structural flexibility with important implications for their diverse catalytic mechanisms. We characterize an in situ structural model of the putative transient ferric intermediate of 20G:taurine dioxygenase (TauD) by using a combination of spectroelectrochemical and semiempirical computational methods, demonstrating that the Fe(III/II) transition involves a substantial, fully reversible, redox-linked conformational change at the active site. This rearrangement alters the apparent redox potential of the active site between -127 mV for reduction of the ferric state and +171 mV for oxidation of the ferrous state of the 20G-Fe-TauD complex. Structural perturbations exhibit limited sensitivity to mediator concentrations and potential pulse duration. Similar changes were observed in the Fe-TauD and taurine-20G-Fe-TauD complexes, thus attributing the reorganization to the protein moiety rather than the cosubstrates. Redox-difference infrared spectra indicate a reorganization of the protein backbone in addition to the involvement of carboxylate and histidine ligands. Quantitative modeling of the transient redox response using two alternative reaction schemes across a variety of experimental conditions strongly supports the proposal for intrinsic protein reorganization as the origin of the experimental observations.

Tomographic 3D Analysis of Reduction Displacement Reaction with Associated Formation of a Conductive Network in High Energy Primary Batteries	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							X-RAY TOMOGRAPHY; ION BATTERY; HIGH-POWER; CARBON NANOTUBES; CATHODE; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; LI/CFX; OXIDE; DISCHARGE	Hybrid Ag2VO2PO4-CFx battery electrodes with high energy and pulse performance were investigated in regards to their structural and morphological changes during electrochemical discharge. Reduction products of CFx and Ag2VO2PO4, carbon and Ag-0, respectively, were identified via bulk laboratory X-ray diffraction and were characterized further by SEM-EDS to identify variations in Ag2VO2PO4-Ag-0 agglomerate distributions in the electrode. X-ray tomography was used to characterize the statistical formation and redistribution of these agglomerates at a higher discharge state. Using this technique, we observed the agglomerates within the electrode to increase from 20-40 mu m(3) to larger sizes (>500 mu m(3)) upon discharge. These data were used to rationalize the changes in conductivity of the composite material upon galvanostatic discharge, as determined under high rate pulsatile discharge and impedance spectroscopy. Both volumetric and spatial redistribution of the materials identified in this study provides insight toward the development and understanding of future high energy and high power primary batteries.

Hindered dialkyl ether synthesis with electrogenerated carbocations	NATURE			English	Article							ELECTROCHEMICAL SYNTHESIS; ANODIC OXIDATION; ACID; ELECTROLYSIS; ALCOHOLS; CARBON	Hindered ethers are of high value for various applications; however, they remain an underexplored area of chemical space because they are difficult to synthesize via conventional reactions(1,2). Such motifs are highly coveted in medicinal chemistry, because extensive substitution about the ether bond prevents unwanted metabolic processes that can lead to rapid degradation in vivo. Here we report a simple route towards the synthesis of hindered ethers, in which electrochemical oxidation is used to liberate high-energy carbocations from simple carboxylic acids. These reactive carbocation intermediates, which are generated with low electrochemical potentials, capture an alcohol donor under non-acidic conditions; this enables the formation of a range of ethers (more than 80 have been prepared here) that would otherwise be difficult to access. The carbocations can also be intercepted by simple nucleophiles, leading to the formation of hindered alcohols and even alkyl fluorides. This method was evaluated for its ability to circumvent the synthetic bottlenecks encountered in the preparation of 12 chemical scaffolds, leading to higher yields of the required products, in addition to substantial reductions in the number of steps and the amount of labour required to prepare them. The use of molecular probes and the results of kinetic studies support the proposed mechanism and the role of additives under the conditions examined. The reaction manifold that we report here demonstrates the power of electrochemistry to access highly reactive intermediates under mild conditions and, in turn, the substantial improvements in efficiency that can be achieved with these otherwise-inaccessible intermediates.

Low-Resistance Molecular Wires Propagate Spin-Polarized Currents	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							ELECTRON TRANSMISSION; CHARGE-TRANSPORT; SELECTIVITY; DELOCALIZATION; SPINTRONICS; ARRAYS; RANGE; HOLE	Spin based properties, applications, and devices are typically related to inorganic ferromagnetic materials. The development of organic materials for spintronic applications has long been encumbered by its reliance on ferromagnetic electrodes for polarized spin injection. The discovery of the chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, in which chiral organic molecules serve as spin filters, defines a marked departure from this paradigm because it exploits soft materials, operates at ambient temperature, and eliminates the need for a magnetic electrode. To date, the CISS effect has been explored exclusively in molecular insulators. Here we combine chiral molecules, which serve as spin filters, with molecular wires that despite not being chiral, function to preserve spin polarization. Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of right-handed helical (L-proline)(8) (Pro(8)) and corresponding peptides, N-terminal conjugated to (porphinato)zinc or meso-to-meso ethyne-bridged (porphinato)zinc structures (Pro(8)PZn(n)), were interrogated via magnetic conducting atomic force microscopy (mC-AFM), spin-dependent electrochemistry, and spin Hall devices that measure the spin polarizability that accompanies the charge polarization. These data show that chiral molecules are not required to transmit spin-polarized currents made possible by the CISS mechanism. Measured Hall voltages for Pro(8)PZn(1-3) substantially exceed that determined for the Pro(8) control and increase dramatically as the conjugation length of the achiral PZnn component increases; mC-AFM data underscore that measured spin selectivities increase with an increasing Pro(8)PZn(1-3) N-terminal conjugation. Because of these effects, spin-dependent electrochemical data demonstrate that spin-polarized currents, which trace their genesis to the chiral Pro(8) moiety, propagate with no apparent dephasing over the augmented Pro(8)PZn(n) length scales, showing that spin currents may be transmitted over molecular distances that greatly exceed the length of the chiral moiety that makes possible the CISS effect.

TPEs have the advantages of high conductivity, good electron transfer kinetics, low cost, reusability, and easy patterning, but have only been used with aqueous solvents due to solvent compatibility with the poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) template. The limited solvent compatibility hinders the application range and surface modifications. Here, cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) TPEs in glass templates that are compatible with additional solvents are presented. TPEs are grafted with aryl diazonium salts in acetonitrile, showing covalent surface TPE modification for the first time. Further investigation is carried out with scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). The TPEs are post-functionalized with a ferrocene moiety via click chemistry. The diazonium electrografting and click chemistry modifications open up future studies and broader applications of TPEs.

Here, we report detailed experimental results and simulations indicating that the situation is more complex than we originally thought. The key new findings are twofold. First, once generated, Cl-2 rapidly reacts with water to form ionic species that increase, rather than decrease, solution conductivity near the anode. Second, the electrochemical potential gradient measured in the vicinity of the anode during Cl- oxidation is dominated by differences in the chemical potential, rather than the electrical potential, of the solution. These findings clarify the electrochemical and chemical processes previously reported to enable desalination via faradaic Cl- oxidation.

The distinctive variety of electronic, optical, and magnetic properties (i.e., accessible electronic transitions, high dielectric constants, wide bandgaps, tunable electrical and thermal conductivities) often encountered in metal oxides are clearly due to the unique nature of their outer d-electrons. Given all conceivable metal oxide combinations, we may find that it is possible to yield structures with unique metallic (i.e., ReO3, RuO2, LaNiO3), semiconducting (i.e., ZnO, TiO2), and insulating (i.e., BaTiO3, Al2O3, SiO2) properties. Strongly correlated metal oxides may also undergo metal-to-insulator phase transitions (i.e., V2O3, VO2, La1-xSrxVO3) which allow us to further tune their electronic properties. Strongly correlated metal oxides may also demonstrate charge density wave (i.e., K0.3MoO3), defect ordering (i.e., Ca2Mn2O5, Ca2Fe2O5), ferromagnetism (i.e., Fe3O4, CrO2, La0.5Sr0.5MnO3), and antiferromagnetism (i.e., NiO, LaCrO3) properties. Given their versatile optical and electronic activity, metal oxides have been extensively investigated as key components in optics, electrochemistry, photocatalysis, plasmonics, and photovoltaics. Understanding the structural, morphological, and optoelectronic properties of either naturally occurring or synthetically fabricated metal oxides provides a pathway for the development of novel metal oxides with properties that can be tuned to fulfill the efficiency demands of a particular application. Here, we present a comprehensive review of the synthesis, characterization tools, and applications of metal oxide nanostructures and their thin films. We will also discuss the synthesis, characterization, and applications of metal oxide heterostructures.

Addition of NaBPh4 to the reduction reaction mixture led to the isolation of [Ni(HMC-Styr)](BPh4)(2) (2'). Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies of 1 and 2' revealed a square planar Ni-II center in both [1](2+) and [2](2+), which is characteristic of a low spin Ni-II d(8) center. Complexes 1 and 2 remain low spin in acetonitrile solution as evidenced by their H-1 NMR spectra and Vis absorption spectra. Complex 1 displayed two irreversible one-electron reductions between -1.4 and -1.8 V (versus Fc(+1/0)) under Ar in 20% aqueous acetonitrile, and exhibited a new peak around -1.9 V under CO2, indicating a mild activity towards CO2 reduction. In contrast, complex 2 displayed a reversible one-electron reduction at -1.59 V (versus Fc(+1/0)) under Ar, and a less reversible reduction under CO2 without shift in potential, revealing the lack of activity towards CO2.

Steric influence of salicylaldehyde-based Schiff base ligands on the formation of trans-[Re(PR3)(2)(Schiff base)](+) complexes	DALTON TRANSACTIONS			English	Article							MAGNETIC-RESONANCE SPECTRA; OXYGEN-ATOM-TRANSFER; INTERMEDIATE OXIDATION-STATES; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANCE; TECHNETIUM ELECTROCHEMISTRY; METHYLTRIOXORHENIUM VII; INORGANIC-CHEMISTRY; PHOSPHINE-LIGANDS; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; SALEN COMPLEXES	Complexes of the type trans-[Re(PR3)(2)(Schiff base)](+) (R = ethyl and/or phenyl) 2-7 were prepared by the reaction of (nBu(4)N)[ReOCl4] with H(2)sal(2)en or H(2)sal(2)ibn followed by addition of a tertiary phosphine. The trans-[Re(PR3)(2)(sal(2)en)](+) complexes 2-4 were stable in solution, whereas the trans-[Re(PR3)(2)(sal(2)ibn)](+) complexes 6-7 were observed to convert to their corresponding cis-[ReO(PR3)(sal(2)ibn)](+) products through a process involving ligand dissociation, metal oxidation, and Schiff base ligand rearrangement. The conversion of the trans-[Re(PR3)(2)(sal(2)ibn)](+) complexes is likely driven by steric interactions between the bulky backbone gem-dimethyl groups of the sal(2)ibn ligand and the phosphine ligands. These complexes were isolated and characterized by H-1 and C-13 NMR, FT-IR spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and single crystal X-ray diffraction. The results reported herein provide insight into the factors that drive trans-[Re(PR3)(2)(Schiff base)](+) complex formation. This will aid in the development of novel Re-186/188 therapeutic agents and the design of novel bifunctional N2O2 Schiff base ligands.

The zircone-coated Li metal shows enhanced air stability, electrochemical performance and high rate capability in symmetrical cell testing. Moreover, as a proof of concept, the protected Li anode is used in a next-generation Li-O-2 battery system and is shown to extend the lifetime by over 10-fold compared to the batteries with untreated Li metal. Furthermore, in-situ synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy is used for the first time to study an artificial SEI on Li metal, revealing the electrochemical stability and lithiation of the zircone film. This work exemplifies significant progress towards the development and understanding of MLD thin films for high performance next-generation batteries.

In this work, we deposited thin films of a-MoSx from two thiomolybdate deposition baths with different sulfur ratios (MoS42- and Mo2S122-) and showed that the sulfur stoichiometry, as determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, is controlled by the precursor of choice and the electrochemical method used to deposit the thin films. Using the Mo2S122- precursor allows access to a MoS6 thin film, with a higher S/Mo ratio compared with that of any previously reported electrodeposited films. We also examined the effect of electrochemistry on the resulting S/Mo ratio in the as-prepared a-MoSx thin films. Samples with S/Mo ratios ranging from 2 to 6 were electrodeposited on glassy carbon (GC) substrates by using anodic, cathodic, or cyclic voltammetry deposition. The a-MoSx thin films deposited on GC substrates were tested as HER catalysts in acidic electrolytes. The overpotentials needed to drive current densities of 10 mA/cm(2) ranged from 160 mV for MoS6 samples to 216 mV for MoS2 samples, signifying the important role sulfur content plays in HER activity of the prepared films. Furthermore, we characterized the deactivation of the a-MoSx films and found that the sulfur content is gradually depleted over time, leading to a slow deactivation of the a-MoSx thin-film catalysts. We showed a facile procedure that affords a-MoSx films with high sulfur content by using S-rich precursors and highlighted the role of sulfur in the prepared films for HER.

Up to now, common strategies for high-density and high-quality interconnections by MCED are focused on creating wire-based suspending 3D microstructures on conductive substrates, and neglect the fabrication process between various parts of the workpiece due to the ambiguous transition mechanism between different substrates. When spanning across an insulating substrate, the common two-electrode MCED process is not well suited for creating interconnections between polarized portions of adjacent parts due to the inevitable formation of bipolar electrodes (BPE), which induces the wire-bonding failure. Here, we describe an effective approach for manipulating the bipolar electrochemistry and suppressing the BPE-induced bonding failures in MCED, by using a double-anode system that facilitates the smooth electrochemical transition from insulating to conductive substrates. Based on this strategy, successful demonstrations of uniform interconnections with low electrical resistivity and high breakdown current density (similar to 6.56 x 10(10) A/m(2)) are presented in the glass-gold transition area. This regulation strategy is potentially extendable to other electrochemical-processible materials for the next generation full 3D printed electronics and microdevices with the merits of enhanced integration density and low cost.

Interestingly, it was found that the magnetic phase transition temperature is around 295 K in LixFePO4 (x <= 0.12) nanocrystals, which is higher than that of LiFePO4 (T-N = 51(1) K) and FePO4 (T-N = 114(1) K) phases. The origin of magnetic order around room temperature (RT) in Li xFePO4 (x <= 0.12) is proposed to be due to both Fe2+-Fe3+ superexchange and the broken local symmetries induced by Fe2+-Li+ antisite defects. Ab initio calculations were adopted to calculate the total energy change of the ferromagnetic state and antiferromagnetic state (Delta E) to qualitatively estimate T-N and proved the existence of the magnetic order around room temperature. Because of the strong Lorentz force in RT magnetic domains, Li ions will be trapped and form sub-10 nm solid solution domains of Li0+delta FePO4, which have a direct relationship with electrochemical performance during (de)lithiation procedures.

J	Baskin, A; Prendergast, D				Baskin, Artem; Prendergast, David			"Ion Solvation Spectra": Free Energy Analysis of Solvation Structures of Multivalent Cations in Aprotic Solvents	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article							ALUMINUM-CHLORIDE COMPLEX; INTERACTION SITE MODEL; SELF-CONSISTENT-FIELD; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; MAGNESIUM-ION; COMPUTATIONAL ELECTROCHEMISTRY; INFRARED-SPECTROSCOPY; ELECTRON-TRANSFER; PHASE-DIAGRAM; X-RAY	Using advanced molecular dynamics free energy sampling techniques-both classical and ab initio-we analyze the solvation structures of multivalent cations in aprotic solvents. In contrast to previous studies of mono- and bivalent ions in organic solvents, mainly performed using hybrid cluster-continuum quantum chemistry calculations that rely on the assumption of uniqueness of ion solvation free energies, here we find that monatomic bivalent cations may have multiple well-defined minima, as previously reported only for water, or plateaus of free energy with respect to the ion-solvent coordination. These observations are generalized in the concept of the "ion solvation spectrum" to highlight the rich phenomenology related to ion solvation as opposed to the normally expected free energy profiles with a single coordination minimum. Specifically, we show that a single chemical species may exhibit a multiplicity of distinctly different electrochemical properties. Using one- and two-dimensional projections of the free energy landscape, we analyze the stability of ion solvation structures and reveal minimum free energy pathways for ion (de-)solvation with low-dimensional approximations to associated kinetic barriers. Unexpectedly, we show that in some cases the process of opening the first ion solvation shell, by removing a solvent molecule, may actually drive the ion into a free energy basin with a higher coordination number. Our study highlights some deficiencies of conventional methodologies for studying ion solvation as a path to determine redox potentials and provides experimentally testable predictions.

Active control of viscous fingering using electric fields	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							PATTERN SELECTION; INSTABILITIES; INTERFACE; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; STABILITY; GROWTH; ELECTROHYDRODYNAMICS; DISPLACEMENT; PERCOLATION; DIFFUSION	Viscous fingering is a widely observed phenomenon, in which finger-like instabilities occur at the interface of two fluids, whenever a less viscous phase displaces a more viscous phase. This instability is notoriously difficult to control, especially for given viscosity ratio and geometry. Here we demonstrate experimentally the active control of viscous fingering of two given liquids, for given geometry and flow rate in a Hele-Shaw cell. The control is realized by taking advantage of electro-osmotic flows along the surfaces confining the fluid, via applying an external electric field. Depending on the direction of electric field, the induced secondary electro-osmotic flows either assist or oppose the hydraulic flow, effectively reducing or increasing the flow resistance, leading to the control of interface stability. The mechanism of apparent "electrokinetic thinning/thickening" is proposed to explain the experimental observations. Theoretical predictions of linear stability are confirmed experimentally for a broad range of immiscible electrolyte displacements.

However, it is challenging to experimentally obtain the energetics of oxygen redox in oxygen electrocatalysis because of the liquid reaction environment. Here we develop a kinetic model that constructs a quantitative relation between the energy profile of oxygen redox and electrochemical kinetic fingerprints. The detailed study here demonstrates that the kinetic fingerprints observed from experiments can be well described by different energetics of oxygen redox. On the basis of the model, a feasible methodology is demonstrated to derive binding energies of the oxygen intermediates from electrochemical data. The surface property of different catalysts derived from our model well rationalizes the experimental trends and predicts potential directions for catalyst design.

The Nernst-Planck equations are simplified to the Debye-Falkenhagen equation, which is solved together with the Poisson equation, leading to analytical formulas for the space charge density and impedance of the system for two parallel plate electrodes. We then define a limit of thin electrical double layer and illustrate the emergence of the characteristic time scale, tau(c) = lambda L-D/D, a function of the Debye length, lambda(D), the electrode separation distance, L, and the ionic diffusion coefficient D. Normalizing the impedance magnitude with the solution resistance and making the frequency dimensionless with the tau(c), we show that all analytical, numerical, and experimental data for different solution conductivities and electrode separation distances collapse onto a single curve. To account for the Stern layer effects, we conducted numerical simulations based on the modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck model and showed that the results agree with our analytical solution for a range of concentrations, with small discrepancies observed only above 0.1 M. Based on the proposed model, experimental impedance spectroscopy results at ac potentials can be used to obtain detailed knowledge of the corresponding surface (and space) charge densities on the electrodes.

Nevertheless, their wide application is still confronted with challenges, which are mainly from advanced materials. Therefore, research on advanced materials for ZFBs in terms of electrodes, membranes, and electrolytes as well as their chemistries are of the utmost importance. Herein, the focus is on the scientific understandings of the fundamental design of these advanced materials and their chemistries in relation to the battery performance. The principles of using different materials in different ZFB technologies, the functions and structure of the materials, and further material improvements are discussed in detail.

Hence, the need to prepare hollow nanotubes is more important. In this present study, we have prepared CuCrO2 hollow nanotubes by simple approach. The CuCrO2 hollow nanotubes were prepared by applying electrospun Al2O3 fibers as a template for the first time. Copper chromium ions were dip-coated on the surface of electrospun-derived Al2O3 fibers and annealed at 600 degrees C in vacuum to form Al2O3-CuCrO2 core-shell nanofibers. The CuCrO2 hollow nanotubes were obtained by removing Al2O3 cores by sulfuric acid wet etching while preserving the rest of original structures. The structures of the CuCrO2-coated Al2O3 core-shell nanofibers and CuCrO2 hollow nanotubes were identified side-by-side by X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The CuCrO2 hollow nanotubes may find applications in electrochemistry, catalysis, and biomedical application. This hollow nanotube preparation method could be extended to the preparation of other hollow nanotubes, fibers, and spheres.

For electrochemistry, NDs are promising to increase active sites and decrease fouling, but NDs have not been studied for neurotransmitter electrochemistry. Here, we optimized ND coatings on microelectrodes and found that ND increases the sensitivity for neurotransmitters with fast scan cyclic voltammetry detection and decreases electrochemical and biofouling. Different sizes and functionalizations of NDs were tested, and ND suspensions were drop-casted onto carbon-fiber microelectrodes (CFMEs). The 5 nm ND H and 5 nm ND-COOH formed thick coatings, while the 15 and 60 nm ND-COOH formed more sparse coatings. With electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, 5 nm ND-H and 5 nm ND-COOH had high charge-transfer resistance, while 15 and 60 nm ND-COOH had low charge-transfer resistance. NDCOOH (15 nm) was optimal, with the best electrocatalytic properties and current for dopamine. Sensitivity was enhanced 2.1 0.2 times and the limit of detection for dopamine improved to 3 +/- 1 nM. ND coating increased current for other cations such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, but not for the anion ascorbic acid. Moreover, NDs decreased electrochemical fouling from serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, and they also decreased biofouling in brain slice tissue by 50%. The current at biofouled ND-coated electrodes is similar to the signal of pristine, unfouled CFMEs. The carboxylated ND-modified CFMEs are beneficial for neurotransmitter detection because of easy fabrication, improved limit of detection, and antifouling properties.

Understanding the mechanisms governing function of these applications requires probing local electrochemical phenomena on the relevant time and length scales. Here, we discuss the challenges and opportunities for extending electrochemical characterization probes to the nanometer and ultimately atomic scales, including challenges in down-scaling classical methods, the emergence of novel probes enabled by nanotechnology and based on emergent physics and chemistry of nanoscale systems, and the integration of local data into macroscopic models. Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) methods based on strain detection, potential detection, and hysteretic current measurements are discussed. We further compare SPM to electron beam probes and discuss the applicability of electron beam methods to probe local electrochemical behavior on the mesoscopic and atomic levels. Similar to a SPM tip, the electron beam can be used both for observing behavior and as an active electrode to induce reactions. We briefly discuss new challenges and opportunities for conducting fundamental scientific studies, matter patterning, and atomic manipulation arising in this context.

J	Cao, CT; Shyam, B; Wang, JJ; Toney, MF; Steinruck, HG				Cao, Chuntian; Shyam, Badri; Wang, Jiajun; Toney, Michael F.; Steinruck, Hans-Georg			Shedding X-ray Light on the Interfacial Electrochemistry of Silicon Anodes for Li-Ion Batteries	ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH			English	Review							SOLID-ELECTROLYTE INTERPHASE; IN-SITU; CRYSTALLINE SILICON; PHOTOELECTRON-SPECTROSCOPY; NANOSCALE STRUCTURE; THIN-FILM; LITHIATION; LITHIUM; REFLECTIVITY; SURFACE	Electrochemical alloying reactions of group IV elements, such as Si, Ge, or Sn, with lithium provide a promising route to next-generation anode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their high volumetric and gravimetric capacities. However, commercialization of these anodes is still sparse owing to quick capacity fading and limited Coulombic efficiency, which arise from large volume expansion leading to particle cracking and subsequent electrochemical inactivity. As a result, the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), originating in the decomposition of the electrolyte upon battery operation outside the electrolyte's thermodynamic stability window, grows uncontrollably. While a large number of mitigation strategies have been developed, an improved nanometer level fundamental understanding of the (de)lithiation process and SEI formation, growth, and evolution is necessary to overcome these challenges. Toward this end, many experimental and theoretical approaches have been utilized but still provide an incomplete picture. This is due to the difficulty of investigating buried interfaces and interphases of lithiation products and thin SEI layers (nanometer-scale) in situ and with the desired nanometer accuracy. In this Account, we illustrate the utilization of in situ X-ray reflectivity (XRR) to provide nanometer-scale insights on the SEI nucleation, growth, and evolution, and well as the (de)lithiation process of Si electrodes. XRR is a nondestructive and surface-and interface-sensitive technique that allows for in situ investigations during battery operation under realistic electrochemical conditions. Insight into the system is provided via the surface-normal density profile, which is interpreted in terms of thickness, density, and roughness of individual surface layers, allowing monitoring of the interfacial morphology and chemistry evolution, through which the SEI growth and Si (de)lithiation process can be resolved. We utilized a model battery anode consisting of a native oxide terminated single crystalline Si wafer in half cell configuration with standard electrolyte in a specifically designed in situ XRR electrochemical cell. We have resolved the nucleation and formation process of the inner inorganic SEI and have observed two well-defined inorganic SEI layers on Si anodes: a bottom-SEI layer (adjacent to the electrode) formed via the lithiation of the native oxide and a top-SEI layer mainly consisting of the electrolyte decomposition product, LiF. This SEI layer grows during lithiation and contracts during delithiation. Further, our results show that the lithiation of crystalline Si (c-Si) is a layer-by-layer, reaction-limited, two-phase process with a well-defined phase boundary between LixSi lithiation product and c-Si; in contrast, the delithiation of LixSi and the lithiation of amorphous Si (a-Si) are reaction-limited, single-phase processes. Moreover, we resolved the influences of current density and the Si crystallographic orientation of the reaction interface on the (de)lithiation process. The implications of our findings are discussed with regard to battery performance.

Lithiated spinel LiCo1-xAlxO2 operates at the highest average potential (similar to 3.7 V vs Li) with the lowest volume change (AV <= 0.02%) ever reported for a zero-strain lithium electrode. Unlike other zero-strain spinel materials such as Li4Ti5O12 and LiRh2O4 that undergo a reversible two-phase reaction, lithiated spinel LiCo1-xAlO2 electrodes operate by a single-phase process. The study opens the door to the design of a new family of zero-strain materials that can be used as a stable cathode for all-solid-state batteries.

This report describes a systematic experimental and theoretical evaluation of a series of hydrogenated fullerenes (C60Hx) for use as high-capacity anodes in lithium ion batteries. It was discovered that there is an optimal degree of hydrogenation for C-60 to achieve reversible lithiation. Under the optimized conditions, C60Hx was found to have a stable capacity of 588 mAh/g for over 600 cycles at a current density of 0.05 A/g. Extended cycling studies at higher current densities demonstrated that this material is stable for 2000 cycles. Theoretical modeling of this system determined that electronic structure changes due to hydrogenation is responsible for the favorable interaction of Li+ with C60Hx. This study represents a unique methodology for increasing anode capacity and optimization of an anode's electrochemical properties by controlling the hydrogen content of the active material.

Electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical characterization of Cu(II) and Mn(III) tetrabutano- and tetrabenzoporphyrins containing sterically hindered meso-(2,6-difluorophenyl) substituents in nonaqueous media	JOURNAL OF PORPHYRINS AND PHTHALOCYANINES			English	Article						butano and benzoporphyrins; electrochemistry; spectroelectrochemistry; substituent effect	FREE-BASE CORROLES; ELECTRON-TRANSFER; MANGANESE PORPHYRINS; MOLECULAR-STRUCTURE; CATALYTIC-ACTIVITY; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; REDOX POTENTIALS; TETRAARYLPORPHYRINS; METALLOPORPHYRINS; DERIVATIVES	Four tetrabutano and tetrabenzoporphyrins containing sterically hindered meso-(2,6-difluorophenyl) substituents and copper(II) or manganese(III) central metal ions were synthesized and characterized as to their electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical properties in nonaqueous media. The copper(II) derivatives exhibit the expected two one-electron reductions to give pi-anion radicals and dianions in CH2Cl2. Electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical data suggest that a Cu(II) phlorin anion is generated from the doubly reduced Cu(II) butanoporphyrin and it is this species which undergoes the third reduction in pyridine. The first one-electron reduction of the Mn(III) porphyrins is metal-centered to give a Mn(II) compound, while the second and third reductions are macrocycle-centered to give Mn(II) porphyrin pi-anion radicals and dianions in both CH2Cl2 and pyridine. A Mn(II) ptdorin anion is also generated from the Mn(II) dianion on the spectroelectrochemical timescale under the given solution conditions. The beta,beta-butano and benzo groups have a significant effect on the measured redox potentials. Steric hindrance of the meso-(2,6-difluorophenyl) substituents also has an effect on the potential separation between the first two oxidations of the benzoporphyrins.

Fundamentally, quantum mechanical processes, at their core, manifest through both electron tunneling and the associated transition between quantized nuclear vibronic states (intramolecular vibrational relaxation) mediated by electron-nuclear coupling. Here, we report on measurements of long-range electron transfer at the interface between a single ferrocene molecule and a gold substrate separated by a hexadecanethiol quantum tunneling barrier. These redox measurements exhibit quantized nuclear transitions mediated by electron-nuclear coupling at 4.7 K in vacuum. By detecting the electric force associated with redox events by atomic force microscopy (AFM), with increasing AFM oscillation amplitude, the intensity of the observed cantilever resonance frequency shift peak increases and then exhibits a series of discrete steps that are indicative of quantized nuclear transitions. The observed peak shapes agree well with a single-electron tunneling model with quantized nuclear state transitions associated with the conversion of the molecule between oxidized and reduced electronic states. This technique opens the door to simultaneously investigating quantized electron and nuclear dynamics in a diverse range of systems.

However, the conversion efficiency from hot electrons to electrochemical products is typically low due to high hot electron scattering rates. Here, it is shown that the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an acidic solution can be efficiently modulated by hot electrons injected into a thin gold film by an Au Al2O3-Si-metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) junction. Despite the large scattering rates in gold, it is shown that the hot electron driven HER can reach quantum efficiencies as high as, similar to 85% with a shift in the onset of hydrogen evolution by similar to 0.6 V. By simultaneously measuring the currents from the solution, gold, and silicon terminals during the experiments, we find that the HER rate can be decomposed into three components: (i) thermal electron, corresponding to the thermal electron distribution in gold; (ii) hot electron, corresponding to electrons injected from silicon into gold which drive the HER before fully thermalizing; and (iii) silicon direct injection, corresponding to electrons injected from Si into gold that drive the HER before electron-electron scattering occurs. Through a series of control experiments, we eliminate the possibility of the observed HER rate modulation coming from lateral resistivity of the thin gold film, pinholes in the gold, oxidation of the MIS device, and measurement circuit artifacts. Next, we theoretically evaluate the feasibility of hot electron injection modifying the available supply of electrons. Considering electron-electron and electron-phonon scattering, we track how hot electrons injected at different energies interact with the gold-solution interface as they scatter and thermalize. The simulator is first used to reproduce other published experimental pump-probe hot electron measurements, and then simulate the experimental conditions used here. These simulations predict that hot electron injection first increases the supply of electrons to the gold-solution interface at higher energies by several orders of magnitude and causes a peaked electron interaction with the gold-solution interface at the electron injection energy. The first prediction corresponds to the observed hot electron electrochemical current, while the second prediction corresponds to the observed silicon direct injection current. These results indicate that MIS devices offer a versatile platform for hot electron sources that can efficiently drive electrochemical reactions.

Carbon dioxide utilization, in which carbon dioxide is either used directly or converted into more valuable products, is likely to be one component of a broad strategy to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, a challenge that will require both technological and policy changes. Catalysis is crucial to the successful conversion of carbon dioxide into value-added products. Here, we provide a review on chemical and biological systems for carbon dioxide conversion directed toward the readers of ACS Catalysis, which focuses on providing a general perspective on the field, rather than technical details. We discuss both challenges related to the conversion of carbon dioxide into specific products such as carbon monoxide, formic acid, methanol, methane, ethylene, fuels, carboxylic acids, and polymers as well as general challenges for the field. We also compare and contrast different methods for carbon dioxide conversion, for example homogeneous versus heterogeneous catalysis or photosynthetic versus nonphotosynthetic biological conversion, and highlight areas where one approach may have advantages over another. In a concluding section, we identify problems related to carbon dioxide conversion that will need to be addressed for technology to be both viable and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.

Microfluidic electrochemical cell for in situ structural characterization of amorphous thin-film catalysts using high-energy X-ray scattering	JOURNAL OF SYNCHROTRON RADIATION			English	Article						atomic layer deposition; electrode architectures; pair distribution functions; high-energy X-ray scattering; catalysts; electrochemistry; ultra-thin films	ATOMIC LAYER DEPOSITION; OXYGEN EVOLUTION REACTION; WATER-OXIDATION; AU(001) RECONSTRUCTION; DOMAIN-STRUCTURE; DIFFRACTION; PHOSPHATE; REFLECTIVITY; RESOLUTION; REDUCTION	Porous, high-surface-area electrode architectures are described that allow structural characterization of interfacial amorphous thin films with high spatial resolution under device-relevant functional electrochemical conditions using high-energy X-ray (>50keV) scattering and pair distribution function (PDF) analysis. Porous electrodes were fabricated from glass-capillary array membranes coated with conformal transparent conductive oxide layers, consisting of either a 40nm-50nm crystalline indium tin oxide or a 100nm-150nm-thick amorphous indium zinc oxide deposited by atomic layer deposition. These porous electrodes solve the problem of insufficient interaction volumes for catalyst thin films in two-dimensional working electrode designs and provide sufficiently low scattering backgrounds to enable high-resolution signal collection from interfacial thin-film catalysts. For example, PDF measurements were readily obtained with 0.2 angstrom spatial resolution for amorphous cobalt oxide films with thicknesses down to 60nm when deposited on a porous electrode with 40 mu m-diameter pores. This level of resolution resolves the cobaltate domain size and structure, the presence of defect sites assigned to the domain edges, and the changes in fine structure upon redox state change that are relevant to quantitative structure-function modeling. The results suggest the opportunity to leverage the porous, electrode architectures for PDF analysis of nanometre-scale surface-supported molecular catalysts.

The integration of multiple physiological modalities for the routine acquisition of multimodal data with microelectrodes could be useful for biomedical applications, yet this has been challenging owing to incompatibilities of fabrication methods. Here, we present a suite of glass pipettes with integrated microelectrodes for the simultaneous acquisition of multimodal intracellular and extracellular information in vivo, electrochemistry assessments, and optogenetic perturbations of neural activity. We used the integrated devices to acquire multimodal signals from the CA1 region of the hippocampus in mice and rats, and show that these data can serve as ground-truth validation for the performance of spike-sorting algorithms. The microdevices are applicable for basic and translational neurobiology, and for the development of next-generation brain-machine interfaces.

Expansion of the urea electrocatalytic oxidation window by adsorbed nickel ions	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Urea; Electrocatalysis; Nickel hydroxide	NICKEL/COBALT HYDROXIDE; CARBON NANOFIBERS; ELECTROOXIDATION; CATALYSTS; ELECTRODES; MECHANISM; EVOLUTION; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; STABILITY; REMOVAL	The electrocatalytic oxidation of urea using Ni-based catalysts is able to oxidize urea at high rates, reaching hundreds of mA cm(-2) depending on electrode and solution properties. Most of the demonstrated systems, however, report a drop-off in current similar to 0.3 V positive of the Ni2+/Ni3+ redox transition resulting in a dramatic decrease of activity. The drop-off limits the electrochemical window available for urea decomposition. To overcome this narrow window, Ni2+ ions are herein adsorbed onto carbon black electrodes cohesively bound with Nafion. The resulting electrodes are electrochemically tested for urea electro-oxidation activity whereby their cyclic voltammograms display no drop-off in activity up to 1.5 V positive of the Ni2+/Ni3+ transition. The oxidation currents of the adsorbed Ni2+ electrodes demonstrate urea decomposition rates nearly identical to Ni-metal films, and impedance measurements show similar charge transfer limitations. Electrodes are monitored after electrochemical cycling with atomic force microscopy to reveal that adsorbed species coalesce into surface particles, which behave like bulk Ni(OH)(2), implying that the commonly observed drop-off in current may be due to structural characteristics of Ni(OH)(2) and NiOOH. The simplicity of the adsorption process and its ability to widen the electrochemical window for urea oxidation allows new substrates to be incorporated into urea degradation systems without sacrificing high urea oxidation rates.

The structure of 4a was characterized by H-1 NMR spectroscopy and the structures of 4b was characterized by H-1 NMR and C-13 NMR spectroscopy. The structure of highly crystalline 4a was further confirmed by X-ray crystallography and a flipping sofa like structure was observed. Non crystalline 4b also predicted the flipping behavior from its variable temperature NMR studies. Although 4a produced ill-defined cyclicvoltammogram due to poor solubility the highly soluble 4b produced well-defined cyclicvoltammogram under identical conditions. Further the electrochemistry showed that 4b undergoes sequential ejection of six electrons reversibly at the potentials of 0.45, 0.61, 0.84, 1.02, 1.18, 1.34 V vs SCE. With 160-200 mV gap between each successive ejection of electrons.

J	Zhao, PY; Guo, Y; Dewald, HD; Chen, H				Zhao, Pengyi; Guo, Yong; Dewald, Howard D.; Chen, Hao			Improvements for absolute quantitation using electrochemical mass spectrometry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MASS SPECTROMETRY			English	Article						Mass spectrometry; Electrochemistry; Chromatography; Quantitation	COMPLEX PROTEIN MIXTURES; PROTEOMICS; QUANTIFICATION; TAGS; IDENTIFICATION; CHEMISTRY; OXIDATION; STRATEGY	We recently reported a new quantitation method using mass spectrometry (MS) in combination with electrochemistry (EC, J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom., 2019, 30, 685). The strength of this method is that no reference standard or isotope-labeled compound is required for absolute quantitation. The method relies on electrochemical oxidation of an electrochemically active target compound to determine the amount of the oxidized compound using Faraday's Law. On the other hand, the oxidation reaction yield can be determined based on the MS signal change following electrolysis. Therefore, the absolute amount of the analyte can be calculated. Our experiment is carried out using a coupled liquid chromatography/electrochemistry/mass spectrometry (LC/EC/MS) apparatus. In this study, the method is further optimized. First, quantifying the compounds in a mixture is possible after the chromatographic separation. Gradient elution is used for separation and each compound can be quantified using the electrochemical mass spectrometry method. Second, for compounds that are already purified, LC column is not necessary and can be removed (i.e., flow-through analysis), thus shortening the analysis time for each injected sample from 10 min to 2 min. With using an LC auto-sampler, multiple samples can be injected sequentially. All the quantitation errors shown in this study are within 5%, indicating a good accuracy of our method.

However, less attention has been drawn to the subsequent generation of other combined chlorine species such as chloramines. In this work, the electrogeneration of chloramines has been assessed in different water matrices containing NHCl4, urea or synthetic urine. The yield of chloramines has been followed in-situ by differential electrochemistry mass spectroscopy (DEMS) during electrochemical advanced oxidation process with boron-doped diamond (BDD) anodes. Furthermore, the influence of several variables such as chloride concentration, pH or organics concentration on the different distribution of inorganic monochloramine, dichloramine and trichloramine released as products has been considered.

Dynamical Effects in Protein Electrochemistry	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B			English	Article							ELECTRON-TRANSFER REACTIONS; GENERALIZED LANGEVIN EQUATION; CYTOCHROME-C; KINETICS; SOLVENT; ENZYMES; AZURIN; REORGANIZATION; TEMPERATURE; MECHANISMS	Electrochemical measurements of electron transfer from an electrode to proteins immobilized at protective layers of varying thickness have shown the presence of two characteristic regimes: (i) exponential (tunneling) decay of the rate constant with the distance to the electrode and (ii) a plateau region where the rate is independent of the distance to the electrode. The reaction in the plateau region is viewed as friction-controlled electron transfer, with the rate constant inversely proportional to the medium relaxation time. Fitting the rates to established theories requires medium relaxation times far exceeding common estimates and relaxation times obtained from computer simulations of the Stokes-shift dynamics. There is a significant disconnect between experimental observations and theoretical expectations. This difficulty is resolved here by allowing additional dissipative dynamics consisting of protein's low-frequency oscillations in a soft harmonic potential describing binding of the protein to the substrate. Protein translational motions modulate the electrode-protein electronic coupling, leading to a new time-scale appearing, along with the Stokes-shift relaxation time, in the pre-exponential factor of the rate constant. The new model provides a consistent account of the experimental data. The anticipated range of friction-controlled kinetics is significantly extended, since the effective relaxation time entering the rate pre-exponential factor gains an exponential dependence on the mean-square displacement of the protein. Since the mean-square displacement is proportional to temperature, the enthalpy of activation acquires a significant and nontrivial temperature dependence. The possibility of a negative reaction enthalpy is predicted.

Ligands L-1, L-2 and L-3 each contain a 1,2-bis((pyridine-2-ylmethyl)-azaneyl)ethane framework decorated with electron donating methyl and methyl/methoxy substituents. We observe a correlation between the electron donating capability of the ligands (L-1 < L-2 < L-3) and the redox potential for the M-II/M-I couple (1 > 2 > 4 and 3 > 5). After thorough identification of the spectroscopic and redox properties of 1-5, the reactivity of the complexes was investigated towards proton and water reduction by means of electro and photocatalysis. These species seemingly support H-2 evolution and display tunable catalytic properties achieved through the presence of differentiated electron donicity. Evidence of degradation with nanoparticle conversion was found to depend on the nature of both ancillary ligand and metal center.	[Kankanamalage, Pavithra H.

Here, the use of a polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM) is reported as a feasible and robust interfacial layer that inhibits dendrite growth. The PIM demonstrates excellent film-forming ability, electrochemical stability, strong adhesion to a copper metal electrode, and outstanding mechanical flexibility so that it relieves the stress of structural changes produced by reversible lithiation. Importantly, the porous structure of the PIM, which guides Li flux to obtain uniform deposition, and its strong mechanical strength combine to suppress dendrite growth. Hence, the electrochemical performance of the anode is significantly enhanced, promising excellent performance and extended cycle lifetime for Li metal batteries.

Methylation at the terminal amines yields the cationic derivatives 2 and 4. All complexes are fully characterized by spectroscopic, electrochemical, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction methods. Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies on all four Ni(II) complexes confirm a square planar Ni(II) framework with no significant changes in the coordination environment as a function of the pendant groups. Spectroscopic studies are consistent with a similar electronic structure in all complexes. However, electrochemical investigations reveal significant cathodic shifts in the Ni(II)L/Ni(II)L center dot- and Ni(II)L center dot-/Ni(I)L center dot 2- reduction potentials of the methylated vs. non-methylated species. The HER activity of all four nickel complexes were evaluated in acetonitrile with glacial acetic acid. The 3 complex was shown to have the highest activity with a TOF of 6.3 x 10(3) s(-1), an overpotential of 0.56 V, and faradaic efficiency of 100 %.

Conventional crystalline materials, including 316L stainless steel, titanium and titanium-based alloys, are most commonly used for medical equipment or devices. However, materials with greater compatibility with biological systems should be studied. An amorphous solid, such as Zirconium (Zr)-based metallic glass, is a possible alternative to the conventional crystalline materials. The prospect of achieving multi-property requirements (i.e., high corrosion and wear resistance, lower elastic modulus and enhanced antibacterial capacity) with Zr-based thin film metallic glass (TFMG) were studied in this work. To form a ternary system with the optimized composition of Zr46Ti40Ag14 and Zr46Ti43Al11, TFMGs were fabricated by magnetron co-sputtering or combinatorial development of a binary Zr-Ti alloy with silver (Ag) or aluminum (Al). The structural characterization via grazing incidence x-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) manifested an amorphous structure for the ternary TFMGs. The electrochemical analyses of the ternary systems revealed lower corrosion- and passive-current density when compared to 316L stainless steel and commercially pure titanium (cp-Ti). These data demonstrated that TFMGs have better corrosion resistant characteristics. Moreover, the systems exhibited appreciable hardness and elastic modulus lower than 316L stainless steel and cp-Ti. Both of the ternary TFMGs exhibited hydrophobicity, whereas only the Zr46TL40Ag14 exhibited significant antibacterial properties and reduced the growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The combination of such desirable properties makes these TFMGs an excellent candidate material for a wide range of biomedical applications.

In this work, voltammetry is used to elucidate the identity of the released iron. Ferritin was covalently immobilized on 6-mercaptohexanoic acid modified gold electrodes. The current-potential curve shows an initial cathodic peak indicating the reduction of ferritin. The return scan gives an anodic peak that is probably due to the oxidation of released Fe(H2O)(6)(2+). The second cycle shows a new cathodic wave suggesting the reduction of the iron species. Voltammetry, while stirring the cell solution, reveals that the released iron is dissolved while the oxidized form is immobilized. The cathodic peak potential of the oxidized iron species has a dependence of 120 mV/pH indicating a two-proton exchange per electron transferred, suggesting that Fe(H2O)(6)(2+) is oxidized to Fe(OH)(2)(+). Results from voltammetric scans in the presence of hesperitin, Trolox, and maltol further suggest that the oxidized form of iron is Fe(OH)(2)(+).

However, capacity fade due to structural changes at high voltages has limited their applications. This study identifies 4.5 V (vs. graphite) as the optimum upper cutoff voltage (UCV) for a Ni-rich NCA cathode [LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2]. At this UCV, NCA delivers a 12 % increase in reversible capacity (when discharged to 2.5 V) and retains 92 % of its initial capacity after 100 cycles at 1C/-1C cycling when compared to 4.2 V as UCV. By increasing UCV to 4.7 V, the discharge capacity can be raised to >200 mAh/g. However, the rate of capacity fade is greater when compared to 4.5 V as UCV. This increased rate of capacity fade, at higher UCV, is related to irreversible lattice contractions that leads to structural rearrangement at charged states during high-voltage cycling. Our results show a change in transition metal oxidation states and an onset of structural ordering occurs when the UCV is 4.7 V.

However, the large volume expansion and the formation of highly reactive lithium silicides during charging cause the continuous lithium and electrolyte consumption as well as the fast decay of Si anodes. In this work, by adding 0.1 M M(TFSI)(x) (M = Mg, Zn, Al and Ca) as a second salt into the electrolyte, we stabilize the anode chemistry through the in situ formation of Li-M-Si ternary phases during the charging process. First, lithium silicides and magnesium lithium silicides were synthesized as model compounds to investigate the influence of metal doping on the reactivity of lithiated Si. Using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we show that Mg doping can dramatically suppress the chemical reactions between the lithium silicide compounds and common electrolyte solvents. New mixed salt electrolytes were prepared containing M(TFSI)(x) as a second salt to LiPF6 and tested in commercially relevant electrodes, which show higher capacity, superior cyclability, and higher Coulombic efficiencies in both half-cell and full-cell configurations (except for Zn) when compared with standard electrolytes. Post-electrochemistry characterizations demonstrate that adding M salts leads to the co-insertion of M cations along with Li into Si during the lithiation process, stabilizing silicon anions by forming more stable Li-M-Si ternaries, which fundamentally changes the traditional Li-Si binary chemistry while minimally affecting silicon electrochemical profiles and theoretical capacities. This study opens a new and simple way to stabilize silicon anodes to enable widespread application of Si anodes for lithium-ion batteries.

Among all the criteria for the large-scale electrical energy storage systems (EESSs), low cost ($ k Wh(-1)) is the focus where MnO2-based electrochemistry can be a competitive candidate. It is notable that MnO2 is one of the few materials that can be employed in various fields of EESSs: alkaline battery, supercapacitor, aqueous rechargeable lithium-ion battery, and metal-air battery. Yet, the technology still has bottlenecks and is short of commercialisation. Discovering key parameters impacting the energy storage and developing systematic characterisation methods for the MnO2 systems can benefit a wide spectrum of energy requirements. In this review, history, mechanism, bottlenecks, and solutions for using MnO2 in the four EESSs are summarised and future directions involving more in-depth mechanism studies are suggested.

Environmental effects of chitosan as an immobilization medium for electrochemically active small molecules	JOURNAL OF COORDINATION CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Chitosan; ferrocene; electrochemistry	SELF-ASSEMBLED MONOLAYERS; ELECTRON-TRANSFER; CHITIN; FERROCENE; BIOSENSORS; ENZYMES	A number of challenges arise when using ferrocene as a component of electrochemical biosensors, including solubility in aqueous solutions. Therefore, entrapment of the biotin-ferrocene molecules within the chitosan film provides a route for immobilization on an electroactive surface such as an electrode while making the system water compatible. The use of the chitosan-ferrocene bioconjugate thin film on the electrode surface produces a signal that can be monitored in aqueous media. Herein, we discuss a series of modified ferrocene molecules that contain various linkers that provide non-covalent entanglement points to the chitosan medium. The electrochemical analysis and electron microscopy results show marked differences in the ferrocene loaded chitosan polymers when the termini of the ferrocene-linker vary between -SH and -NH2. The -SH modified systems showed increased reversible and robust electrochemical signals relative to the -NH2 congeners. Further studies showed that non-covalent impregnation strategy used is robust to degradation and less than 1% of the ferrocene molecules were leached over time. These results indicate that there are specific considerations needed when using chitosan-ferrocene systems as components in sensor arrays in future studies.

Herein, we report simulation evidence of 2-dimensional (2D) ice formation on various surfaces and the dependence of the 2D crystalline structure on the hydrophobicity and morphology of the underlying surface. Contrary to the prevailing view that nanoscale confinement is necessary for the 2D liquid-to-bilayer ice transition, we find that the liquid-to-bilayer hexagonal ice (BHI) transition can occur either on a model smooth surface or on model fcc-crystal surfaces with indices of (100), (110), and (111) near room temperature. We identify a critical parameter that characterizes the water-surface interaction, above which the BHI can form on the surface. This critical parameter increases as the temperature increases. Even at temperatures above the freezing temperature of bulk ice (I-h), we find that BHI can also form on a superhydrophilic surface due to the strong water-surface interaction. The tendency toward the formation of BHI without confinement reflects a proper water-surface interaction that can compensate for the entropy loss during the freezing transition. Furthermore, phase diagrams of 2D ice formation are described on the plane of the adsorption energy versus the fcc lattice constant (E-ads-a(fcc)), where 4 monolayer square-like ices are also identified on the fcc model surfaces with distinct water-surface interactions.

Effect of the Electrolyte Solvent on Redox Processes in Mg-S Batteries	INORGANIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article							REVERSIBLE MAGNESIUM DEPOSITION; ALUMINUM-CHLORIDE COMPLEX; ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; PERFORMANCE; SPECIATION; AL	Mg-S batteries are attractive for next-generation energy storage because of their high theoretical capacity and low cost. The foremost challenge in Mg-S batteries is designing electrolytes that support reversible electrochemistry at both electrodes. Here, we target a solution-mediated reduction pathway for the S-8 cathode by tailoring the electrolyte solvent. Varying the solvent in Mg-based systems is complicated because of the active nature of the solvent in solvating Mg2+ and the complex dynamics of electrolyte-Mg interfaces. To understand the effect of the solvent on the S-8 reduction processes in the Mg-S cell, the magnesium aluminum chloride complex (MACC) electrolyte was prepared in different ethereal solvents. Reversible Mg electrodeposition is demonstrated in the MACC electrolyte in several solvent systems. The electrodeposition overpotentials and current densities are found to vary with the solvent, suggesting that the solvent plays a noninnocent role in the electrochemical processes at the Mg interface. Mg-S cells are prepared with the electrolytes to understand how the solvent affects the reduction of S-8. A reductive wave is present in all linear-sweep voltammograms, and the peak potential varies with the solvent. The peak potential is approximately 0.8 V versus Mg/Mg2+, lower than the expected reduction potential of 1.7 V. We rule out passivation of the Mg anode as the cause for the low voltage peak potential, making processes at the S-8 cathode the likely culprit. The ability to oxidize MgS with the MACC electrolyte is also examined, and we find that the oxidation current can be attributed to side reactions at the C-electrolyte interface.

J	Boldini, A; Rosen, M; Cha, YS; Porfiri, M				Boldini, Alain; Rosen, Maxwell; Cha, Youngsu; Porfiri, Maurizio			Contactless actuation of perfluorinated ionomer membranes in salt solution: an experimental investigation	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							IONIC POLYMER TRANSDUCERS; LINEAR ELECTROMECHANICAL MODEL; BEAMS; CONDUCTIVITY; COMPOSITES; TRANSPORT; GELS	A variety of modeling frameworks have been proposed for ionic polymer metal composites (IPMCs), but the physical underpinnings of their actuation remain elusive. A critical step toward the validation of existing theories and transition to engineering practice entails the design of new experimental paradigms that could support hypothesis-driven research. While several factors exacerbate the complexity of experimenting with IPMCs, the presence of the electrodes plays a major role by hindering the repeatability of the results and bringing a number of difficult-to-measure parameters into the picture. Here, we seek to address these experimental confounds by investigating contactless actuation of perfluorinated ionomer membranes in salt solution. In contrast to IPMCs that bend toward the anode in response to an applied voltage, ionomer membranes display a consistent deflection toward the cathode. Through hypothesis-driven experiments where the membrane width, solution concentration, and voltage applied across the electrodes are systematically varied, we elucidate electrochemistry and mechanics of contactless actuation. The applied voltage and solution concentration have a dominant role on the electrochemistry, while mechanics is mainly affected by the applied voltage and membrane width. Our results depict a complex scenario, which is expected to inform future theoretical inquiries about IPMC actuation.

Low-Energy Room-Temperature Healing of Cellular Metals	ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS			English	Article						cellular materials; electrochemistry; healing; metal; nickel	POLYMERS; CRACKS	Healing metallic materials involves high temperatures and large energy inputs. This work demonstrates rapid, effective, low-energy, and room-temperature healing of metallic materials by using electrochemistry and polymer-coated cellular nickel to mimic the transport-mediated healing of bone. The polymer coating enables selective healing only at the fracture site, electrochemical reactions transport metal ions from a metal source to fractured areas, and the cellular structure of the metal allows facile ion transport to healing sites and effective recovery of strength and toughness when the cellular metal is subjected to three types of damage (scission fracture, tensile failure, and plastic deformation). Using this strategy, samples fractured in tension and by scission recover 100% of their tensile strength in as little as 10 and 4 h of healing. The healing process is stochastic, thus a statistical method is used to quantify and predict the likelihood of achieving target healing strengths based on energy input. This electrochemistry-based approach enables the first demonstration of room-temperature healing of structural metallic materials and requires several orders of magnitude less energy than many previously reported metal healing techniques.

The sensor consists of a universal stem loop probe attached to a solid surface, and two analyte-specific adaptor strands. These adaptor strands hybridize to a nucleic acid analyte and provide both highly specific recognition and high binding affinity. The universal probe can be regenerated by a simple and quick rinse with urea and water. As a proof of concept, we differentiated long target sequences of Zika (141 nt.) and Dengue (114 nt.) viruses that contain secondary structures. The proposed sensor provides a platform for rapid and cost-efficient detection of potentially any DNA or RNA sequence using a single electrochemical sensor.

Herein, porous transition metal doped tungsten phosphide (M-WP, M=Mo, Co) catalysts have been developed as enhanced HER electrocatalysts in comparison with pristine WP. Owing to the incorporated transition metals, the as-prepared M-WP nanomaterials exhibit porous nanostructures, abundant active sites and reduced charge transfer resistances. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further demonstrate that the Co dopant simultaneously facilitates the water dissociation step and optimizes the hydrogen adsorption free energy during the entire HER process. Consequently, the Co-WP catalyst shows efficient and stable HER performance over wide pH range. This work demonstrates how metal dopants promote the HER kinetics and develops the strategy for further designing non-precious metal based nanomaterials for energy conversion and electrocatalysis.

J	Gauthier, JA; Dickens, CF; Ringe, S; Chan, K				Gauthier, Joseph A.; Dickens, Colin F.; Ringe, Stefan; Chan, Karen			Practical Considerations for Continuum Models Applied to Surface Electrochemistry	CHEMPHYSCHEM			English	Article							TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; AB-INITIO; OXYGEN; POTENTIALS; REDUCTION; INSIGHTS; WATER; CO2	Modelling the electrolyte at the electrochemical interface remains a major challenge in ab initio simulations of charge transfer processes at surfaces. Recently, the development of hybrid polarizable continuum models/ab initio models have allowed for the treatment of solvation and electrolyte charge in a computationally efficient way. However, challenges remain in its application. Recent literature has reported that large cell heights are required to reach convergence, which presents a serious computational cost. Furthermore, calculations of reaction energetics require costly iterations to tune the surface charge to the desired potential. In this work, we present a simple capacitor model of the interface that illuminates how to circumvent both of these challenges. We derive a correction to the energy for finite cell heights to obtain the large cell energies at no additional computational expense. We furthermore demonstrate that the reaction energetics determined at constant charge are easily mapped to those at constant potential, which eliminates the need to apply iterative schemes to tune the system to a constant potential. These developments together represent more than an order of magnitude reduction of the computational overhead required for the application of polarizable continuum models to surface electrochemistry.

In this follow-up study, we have focused on the electrochemical behavior of four 2 '-deoxynucleosides derived from adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine, uracil, and 5-methyl cytosine on the PGE. On one hand we have obtained analogous primary redox responses as previously with the oligonucleotides. On the other hand, significant differences were observed, particularly when considering secondary responses involving products of the primary conversions, suggesting involvement of different mechanisms. Further we have found that presence of the ambient oxygen in the electrolyte does not dramatically affect the redox signals of the nucleosides. This finding is in contrast with DNA responses measured at the mercury-based electrodes, where deaeration prior to the measurements was necessary. We demonstrate that all studied nucleosides can be analyzed using a simple ex situ (medium exchange) procedure.

Metalation with PhSiCl3 results in [(XbicH(2))SiPh][HCl2], where the silicon adopts a five-coordinate, square pyramidal geometry in the upper pocket and the lower pocket binds to two protons on the imine nitrogens. Deprotonation of the imines with (LiOBu)-Bu-t, NaN[SiMe3](2), or AgOAc results in binding of the univalent metal ion in the lower pocket, where it adopts an unusual pentagonal monopyramidal geometry in the solid state. The complexes show irreversible electrochemistry, with oxidations taking place at relatively high potentials.

Optimized conditions previously reported for the ATRP of some water-soluble monomers cannot be regarded as universal conditions. Indeed, well-controlled electrochemically mediated ATRP (eATRP) of oligo(ethylene oxide)methyl ether acrylate (OEOA) and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) were achieved by adjusting the conditions in relation to the solubility and reactivity of these monomers and corresponding polymers. Importantly, PEOA with low dispersity and predetermined molecular weight was obtained even with low catalyst loading and high monomer content (up to 50 vol %). Moreover, >90% conversion of HEMA was obtained within 6-7 h, giving PHEMA with dispersity 1.2-1.3. This work confirms eATRP as a versatile, clean technique applicable to a range of water-soluble, biocompatible monomers. (c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part A: Polym.

Corrosion of carbon steel and the passivating properties of corrosion films formed under high-PT geothermal conditions	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							CO2 CORROSION; MILD-STEEL; IRON; IMPEDANCE; MECHANISM; BEHAVIOR; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; STABILITY; ALLOYS; ANIONS	Corrosion is a major obstacle to a safe implementation of geotechnical applications. Using a novel approach that includes vertical scanning interferometry (VSI) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) we discuss time-dependent carbon steel corrosion and film formation at geothermally relevant temperatures (80-160 degrees C) in CO2-saturated mildly acidic Na-Cl brine. Iron dissolution kinetics follows a logarithmic rate at 80 and 160 degrees C and a linear rate at 120 degrees C. At 80 degrees C, high initial corrosion rates (first 24 h) generate H-2 at a minimum rate of 12 mu mol h(-1) cm(-2) and lead to the formation of a continuous similar to 100 mu m thick porous corrosion film. It exhibits a duplex structure with a crystalline outer FeCO3 layer and an inner layer composed of a skeletal network of Fe3C impregnated with FeCO3. Being an electrical conductor we hypothesize the Fe3C to strongly enhance corrosion rates by providing additional cathodic sites. Pseudo-passivity due to an anodic film-forming reaction (presumably Fe-oxide) was observed at 120 and 160 degrees C, soon followed by the initiation of pitting at 120 degrees C. Steady-state corrosion rates at 160 degrees C are at least one order of magnitude lower than for 120 degrees C. Our experimental approach demonstrated potential for general applicability in studying corrosion-related phenomena. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this area, our group recently reported a set of phenothiazine-based polymers that exhibit both high capacities and power densities. In order to rationally improve the properties of these electrode materials, a fundamental understanding of their electrochemical properties is indispensable. Herein, we probe the electrochemical behavior of our phenothiazine-based systems by synthesizing small molecule analogs using C-N cross-coupling. Additionally, electropolymerization of a class of these small molecule phenothiazines yields thin films that were then characterized with an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance. Analysis of these materials provides insights into the number of electrons accessed from each repeat unit in our polymer backbone during electrochemical cycling, as well as counter ion transport dynamics.

Effects of Metal Electrode Support on the Catalytic Activity of Fe(oxy)hydroxide for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Alkaline Media	CHEMPHYSCHEM			English	Article						electrochemistry; heterogeneous catalysis; iron oxyhydroxide; oxygen evolution; water electrolysis	ELECTROCHEMICAL EVOLUTION; ENHANCED ACTIVITY; MANGANESE OXIDE; NICKEL-OXIDE; THIN-FILM; GOLD; ELECTROCATALYSTS; NANOPARTICLES; NANOSHEETS; STABILITY	FeOxHy and Fe-containing Ni/Co oxyhydroxides are the most-active catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. However, the activity of Fe sites appears strongly dependent on the electrode-substrate material and/or the elemental composition of the matrix in which it is embedded. A fundamental understanding of these interactions that modulate the OER activity of FeOxHy is lacking. We report the use of cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry to assess the substrate-dependent activity of FeOxHy on a number of commonly used electrode substrates, including Au, Pt, Pd, Cu, and C. We also evaluate the OER activity and Tafel behavior of these metallic substrates in 1 M KOH aqueous solution with Fe3+ and other electrolyte impurities. We find that the OER activity of FeOxHy varies by substrate in the order Au>Pd approximate to Pt approximate to Cu>C. The trend may be caused by differences in the adsorption strength of the Fe oxo ion on the substrate, where a stronger adhesion results in more adsorbed Fe at the interface during steady-state OER and possibly a decreased charge-transfer resistance at the FeOxHy-substrate interface. These results suggest that the local atomic and electronic structure of [FeO6] units play an important role in catalysis of the OER as the activity can be tuned substantially by substrate interactions.

Intensified Electrocatalytic CO2 Conversion in Pressure-Tunable CO2-Expanded Electrolytes	CHEMSUSCHEM			English	Article						catalysis; CO2 expanded liquids; electrochemistry; electroreduction; renewable energy	CARBON-DIOXIDE; ELECTROCHEMICAL REDUCTION; PHOTOCATALYTIC REDUCTION; PHASE-EQUILIBRIA; SYSTEMS; ELECTROREDUCTION; CATALYSIS; ENERGY; INVOLVEMENT; CHALLENGES	Multimolar CO2 concentrations are achieved in acetonitrile solutions containing supporting electrolyte at relatively mild CO2 pressures (<5 MPa) and ambient temperature. Such CO2-rich, electrolyte-containing solutions are termed as CO2-eXpanded Electrolytes (CXEs) because significant volumetric expansion of the liquid phase accompanies CO2 dissolution. Cathodic polarization of a model polycrystalline gold electrode-catalyst in CXE media enhances CO2 to CO conversion rates by up to an order of magnitude compared with those attainable at near-ambient pressures, without loss of selectivity. The observed catalytic process intensification stems primarily from markedly increased CO2 availability. However, a non-monotonic correlation between the dissolved CO2 concentration and catalytic activity is observed, with an optimum occurring at approximately 5 m CO2 concentration. At the highest applied CO2 pressures, catalysis is significantly attenuated despite higher CO2 concentrations and improved mass-transport characteristics, attributed in part to increased solution resistance. These results reveal that pressure-tunable CXE media can significantly intensify CO2 reduction rates over known electrocatalysts by alleviating substrate starvation, with CO2 pressure as a crucial variable for optimizing the efficiency of electrocatalytic CO2 conversion.

Using methylene green and thionine acetate as redox mediators and myoglobin as the analyte, we demonstrate that normal pulse spectrovoltammetry (NPSV) with Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) detection and subsequent global spectral regression analysis can resolve structural and thermodynamic properties simultaneously with little a priori information. Both the E-1/2 and unbiased redox difference FT-IR spectra of the Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox couple of myoglobin in reduction and oxidation NPSV modes were in good agreement with those reported earlier by independent techniques. The thermodynamic and kinetic limitations of mediators/analyte interactions were investigated using comprehensive semiempirical kinetic simulation models. This modeling effort yielded a flexible computational tool capable of quantitatively predicting the redox response in mediated electrochemical studies and defining its limitations, thus greatly expanding the range and precision of the formal mediator/analyte concentration ratio rule.

Herein, we make highly monodisperse NEs with similar to 40 nm diameter, composed of biocompatible surfactants, castor oil as plasticizers, and ion exchangers. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements with periodically varying surfactant to oil ratios provide us with a structural implication about uneven distributions of incorporating components inside NEs. To support this structural insight, we apply SEE and selectively monitor electron-transfer reactions occurring at individual NEs containing ferrocene upon each collision onto a Pt ultramicroelectrode. The quantitative analysis of the nanoelectrochemical results along with DLS and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements reveal nanostructured compartments of incorporating components inside NEs and their effect on the electrochemical behavior. Indeed, a tunneling barrier inside NEs could be formed depending on the NE composition, thus determining an electrochemical behavior of NEs, which cannot be differentiated by a general morphological study such as DLS and TEM but by our SEE measurements. Furthermore, by employing the nanopipet voltammetry with an interface between two immiscible electrolyte solutions (ITIES) to mimic the NE interface, we could explicitly investigate that the electron-transfer reaction occurring inside NEs is facilitated by the ion-transfer reaction. Overall, these comprehensive electrochemical approaches enable us to elucidate the relation between structures and the electrochemical functionality of NEs and provide quantitative criteria for the proper compositions of NEs regarding their activity in the electrochemical applications. Also, this finding should be a prerequisite for suitable biomedical/electrochemical applications of NEs.

Next-generation nonaqueous alkali metal-ion batteries, namely sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs), are projected to utilize intercalation-based carbon anodes as well, due to their favorable electrochemical properties. While traditionally graphite anodes have dominated the market share of LIBs, other carbon materials have been investigated, including graphene, carbon nanotubes, and disordered carbons. The relationship between carbon material properties, electrochemical performance, and charge storage mechanisms is clarified for these alkali metal-ion batteries, elucidating possible strategies for obtaining enhanced cycling stability, specific capacity, rate capability, and safety aspects. As a key component in determining cell performance, the solid electrolyte interphase layer is described in detail, particularly for its dependence on the carbon anode. Finally, battery safety at extreme temperatures is discussed, where carbon anodes are susceptible to dendrite formation, accelerated aging, and eventual thermal runaway. As society pushes toward higher energy density LIBs, this review aims to provide guidance toward the development of sustainable next-generation SIBs and PIBs.

Developing efficient, inexpensive and durable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has been one of the major focuses of applied electrochemistry and has attracted considerable research attention in the past decades. Non-oxide based transition metal compounds, typically transition metal phosphides (TMPs) and chalcogenides (TMCs), have recently emerged as new categories of OER pre-catalysts, demonstrated outstanding electrocatalytic performance as compared to the conventional oxide- or hydroxide-based OER catalysts for alkaline water electrolysis, and even shown promise to replace noble metals for proton-exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. In this feature article, we will summarize the latest advances in the development of TMP- and TMC-based OER electrocatalysts. In particular, we will discuss the electrochemical stability of TMPs and TMCs predicted using Pourbaix diagrams and their morphological, structural and compositional evolution under OER conditions. We will also point out some challenges to be addressed in this specific area of research and propose further investigations yet to be done.

In addition, carbon materials have shown to be the ideal electrode materials for double-layer supercapacitors owing to their large specific surface area, high electrical conductivity, and stable physicochemical properties. Herein, an easily operated approach is established to efficiently convert waste poly(ethylene terephthalate) beverage bottles into porous carbon nanosheet (PCNS) through the combined processes of catalytic carbonization and KOH activation. PCNS features an ultrahigh specific surface area (2236 m(2) g(-1)), hierarchically porous architecture, and a large pore volume (3.0 cm(3) g(-1)). Such excellent physicochemical properties conjointly contribute to the outstanding supercapacitive performance: 169 F g(-1) (6 M KOH) and 135 F g(-1) (1 M Na2SO4). Furthermore, PCNS shows a high capacitance of 121 F g(-1) and a corresponding energy density of 30.6 Wh kg(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1) in the electrolyte of 1 M TEATFB/PC. When the current density increases to 10 A g(-1), the capacitance remains at 95 F g(-1), indicating the extraordinary rate capability. This work not only proposes a facile approach to synthesize PCNS for supercapacitors, but also puts forward a potential sustainable way to recycle waste plastics and further hopefully mitigates the waste plastics-related environmental issues.

When a biorelevant modality aligns with instrumentation capabilities, remarkable successes have been observed (e.g., electrodes provide a powerful tool to observe and actuate biology through its ion-based electrical modality). Emerging biological research demonstrates that redox is another biologically relevant modality, and recent research has shown that advanced electrochemical methods enable biodevice communication through this redox modality. Here, we briefly summarize the biological relevance of this redox modality and the use of redox mediators to enable access to this modality through electrochemical measurements. Next, we describe the fabrication of a catechol-chitosan redox capacitor that is redox-active but nonconducting and thus offers a unique set of molecular electronic properties that enhance access to redox-based information. Finally, we cite several recent studies that demonstrate the broad potential for this capacitor to access redox-based biological information. In summary, we envision the redox capacitor will become a vital component in the integrated circuitry of redox-linked bioelectronics.

This review highlights recent results demonstrating how metal nanowires can exhibit better durability and higher activity than traditional metal nanoparticle electrocatalysts on carbon supports. Metal nanowires can also form interconnected two-dimensional and three-dimensional (3D) networks that eliminate the need for a carbon support, thus eliminating the detrimental effects of carbon corrosion. Porous 3D networks of nanowires can be used as flow-through electrodes with the highest specific surface areas and mass transport coefficients obtained to date, enabling dramatic increases in the productivity of electrochemical reactions. Nanowire networks are also serving as 3D current collectors that improve the capacity of batteries. The tunable surface structure and dimensions of metal nanowires offer researchers a new opportunity to create electrodes that are tailored from the atomic scale to the microscale to improve electrochemical performance.

In this paper, a colorimetric and fluorescent dual-mode probe was constructed based on N-doped carbon dots (CDs) that was synthesized using hydrothermal heating followed by microwave irradiation. The CDs were purified using a polarity-based method followed by a size-based method. The CDs selectively form a purple-colored complex with Fe3+ ions accompanied by quenching of the fluorescence emission. The fluorescence emission of CDs was not affected by common metal cations and anions, but was only complexed and quenched by Fe3+ ions. Cyclic voltammetry and optical spectroscopy were used to measure the HUMO and LUMO levels of the CDs. The fluorescence quenching is due to the transfer of the photo-induced electrons from the excited state of the CDs to the LUMO of Fe3+ ions. The fluorescence lifetime of CDs in the presence and absence of Fe3+ was examined by time-correlated single-photon counting. These results along with changes in the absorption spectra suggest a static fluorescence quenching mechanism. The CDs were used as a dual-readout probe for the colorimetric and fluorescent detection of Fe3+ ions in real samples. The lower limit of detection obtained using colorimetry was 0.5 mu M (S/N = 3), while that obtained using fluorimetry was 50 nM. The fluorescence intensity of the CDs is pH independent between 2 and 9, which increases the working range for practical application. Furthermore, the CDs in aqueous solution are photostable, thermostable, and stable under high ionic strength, which makes the probe robust and rugged.

Different electrodes were prepared by varying the deposition time, corresponding to catalyst loadings of 0.37, 0.74, 2.22, 3.70 mg cm(-2) and a total charge density of 0.5, 1, 3, and 5 C cm(-2), respectively. The electrodes were characterized with SEM, XRD, and UPD. The effect of catalyst loading on the selectivity towards ethylene was investigated in an alkaline flow electrolyzer under ambient conditions. The electrodes were found to be highly selective (>60 %) towards ethylene. The 1 C cm(-2) electrode reached Faradaic efficiency values as high as 67 % at industrially relevant current densities of 183 mA cm(-2), -0.8 V cathode overpotential and 36 % cell energy efficiency. This performance was attributed to the interplaying role of applied potential, local pH, availability of active sites, and reduced CO2 mass transport limitations.

This work presents a feasible way to decrease the disorder in the ball-milled composite of epsilon-LiVOPO4/C by post-annealing at 450 degrees C in an Ar atmosphere, with no reduction reaction caused by carbon and no particle growth. The post-annealed material shows recovered voltage plateaus, enhanced kinetics of Li diffusivity, and suppressed interfacial reactions. As a result, a high-performance solid-state synthesized epsilon-LiVOPO4 can be obtained, delivering a capacity of 270 mAh g(-1) at C/5 with less than 4% degradation upon 100 cycles.

In addition to stabilization of the active cathode material, a concurrent development of electrolyte systems of better compatibility is critical to overcome these limitations for practical applications. Here, with nonaqueous electrolytes based on exclusively aprotic acyclic carbonates free of ethylene carbonate (EC), superior electrochemical and thermal characteristics are obtained with an ultrahigh-nickel cathode (LiNi0.94Co0.06O2), capable of reaching a 235 mA h g(-1) specific capacity. Pouch-type graphite|LiNi0.94Co0.06O2 cells in EC-free electrolytes withstand several hundred charge-discharge cycles with minor degradation at both ambient and elevated temperatures. In thermal-abuse tests, the cathode at full charge, while reacting aggressively with EC-based electrolytes below 200 degrees C, shows suppressed self-heating without EC. Through 3D chemical and structural analyses, the intriguing impact of EC is visualized in aggravating unwanted surface parasitic reactions and irreversible bulk structural degradation of the cathode at high voltages. These results provide important insights in designing high-energy electrodes for long-lasting and reliable lithium-ion batteries.

Among the most notable of these are Na-ion supercapacitors and batteries, motivated, in part, by the similar electrochemistry of Li and Na ions. However, sodium ion batteries (SIBs) come with their own set of issues, especially the large size of the Na+ ion, its relatively sluggish kinetics and low energy densities. This makes the development of novel materials and appropriate electrode architecture of absolute significance. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted a lot of attention in this regard due to their relative ease of exfoliation, diverse morphologies and architectures with superior electronic properties. Here, we study the electrochemical performance of Mo-based two-dimensional (2D) layered TMDs (e.g. MoS2, MoSe2 and MoTe2), exfoliated in a superacid, for battery and supercapacitor applications. The exfoliated TMD flakes were interfaced with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to be used as composite electrodes. Electron microscopy, elemental mapping and Raman spectra were used to analyse the exfoliated material and confirm the formation of 2D TMD/rGO layer morphology. For supercapacitor applications in aqueous electrolyte, the sulfide-based TMD (MoS2) exhibited the best performance, providing an areal capacitance of 60.25 mF cm(-2). For SIB applications, TMD electrodes exhibited significantly higher charge capacities than the neat rGO electrode. The initial desodiation capacities for the composite electrodes are 468.84 mAh g(-1) (1687.82 C g(-1)), 399.10 mAh g(-1) (1436.76 C g(-1)) and 387.36 mAh g(-1) (1394.49 C g(-1)) for MoS2, MoSe2 and MoTe2, respectively. Also, the MoS2 and MoSe2 composite electrodes provided a coulombic efficiency of near 100% after a few initial cycles.

Balancing Light Absorption and Charge Transport in Vertical SnS2 Nanoflake Photoanodes with Stepped Layers and Large Intrinsic Mobility	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						close space sublimation; photo-electrochemistry; SnS2 nanoflakes	ULTRAFAST CARRIER DYNAMICS; SINGLE-CRYSTAL SNS2; 2-DIMENSIONAL SNS2; TIN DISULFIDE; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; MONOLAYER SNS2; THIN-FILMS; 2D SNS2; MOS2; NANOSHEETS	Significant optical absorption in the blue-green spectral range, high intralayer carrier mobility, and band alignment suitable for water splitting suggest tin disulfide (SnS2) as a candidate material for photo-electrochemical applications. In this work, vertically aligned SnS2 nanoflakes are synthesized directly on transparent conductive substrates using a scalable close space sublimation (CSS) method. Detailed characterization by time-resolved terahertz and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopies reveals a high intrinsic carrier mobility of 330 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) and photoexcited carrier lifetimes of 1.3 ns in these nanoflakes, resulting in a long vertical diffusion length of approximate to 1 mu m. The highest photo-electrochemical performance is achieved by growing SnS2 nanoflakes with heights that are between this diffusion length and the optical absorption depth of approximate to 2 mu m, which balances the competing requirements of charge transport and light absorption. Moreover, the unique stepped morphology of these CSS-grown nanoflakes improves photocurrent by exposing multiple edge sites in every nanoflake. The optimized vertical SnS2 nanoflake photoanodes produce record photocurrents of 4.5 mA cm(-2) for oxidation of a sulfite hole scavenger and 2.6 mA cm(-2) for water oxidation without any hole scavenger, both at 1.23 V-RHE in neutral electrolyte under simulated AM1.5G sunlight, and stable photocurrents for iodide oxidation in acidic electrolyte.

More importantly, a series of reactions within an ITO/hybrid perovskite/Au device can be electrochemically induced near room temperature by applied cathodic voltages as low as -1.2 V. Cyclic voltammetry in this range leads to eventual In3+ leaching into the perovskite layer in the form of InI3, unambiguously identified by a binding energy signature of 445.9-446.3 eV measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Furthermore, the etching is exacerbated by defects generated by O-2-plasma treatment of the ITO compared to UV-ozone cleaning, lowering the reaction potential and the electrochemical stability window of an ITO/MAPbI(3)/Au device. Low-temperature, electrochemical reactivity at this interface has implications on operational stability, fundamental studies of hybrid perovskite materials, electron (or hole) transport layer free perovskite devices, reverse bias degradation, and other applications where ITO/hybrid perovskite contact is possible.

In this communication, new conditions that address these challenges are reported. The nickel catalyzed reductive cross-coupling of aryl bromides with alkyl bromides can be conducted in a divided electro-chemical cell using acetonitrile as the solvent and diisopropylamine as the sacrificial reductant to afford coupling products in synthetically useful yields (22-80%). Additionally, the use of a combination of the ligands 4,4',4"-tri-tert-butyl-2,2':6',2'-terpyridine and 4,4'-di-tertbutyl-2,2'-bipyridine is essential to achieve high yields.

Catalytic Effects of Aniline Polymerization Assisted by Oligomers	ACS CATALYSIS			English	Article						polyaniline; polymerization; autocatalytic; oligoaniline; initiators; kinetics; oligomers	POLYANILINE NANOFIBERS; CONDUCTING POLYMER; CHEMICAL POLYMERIZATION; ELECTRICAL-PROPERTIES; FACILE SYNTHESIS; OXIDATION; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; REDOX; ELECTROPOLYMERIZATION; AGGREGATION	Polyaniline was first confirmed as a dark green precipitate on an electrode during the electrochemical polymerization of aniline in 1862. Since then, scientists have been studying the kinetics and growth mechanisms of polyaniline through the electrochemical approach. Studies have shown that p-phenylenediamine, p-aminodiphenylamine, and other aromatic small molecules may serve as initiators for accelerating the polymerization reaction due to the autocatalytic effect of polyaniline. However, little research has been focused on the catalytic effects of introducing oligoanilines. In this paper, quantitative rate constants for the electrochemical polymerization of aniline in both HCl and acetonitrile/HCl solutions with 0.5 mol % of added oligoanilines including diphenylamine, N-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine, 1,4-phenylenediamine, N,N'-diphenyl-1,4-phenylenediamine, 4,4'-diaminodiphenylamine, and tetraaniline in both emeraldine and leucoemeraldine states are reported. Among all the rate constants, N-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine, 1,4-phenylenediamine, and 4,4'-diaminodiphenylamine are shown to be the most effective catalysts for aniline polymerization. Tetraaniline is likely the intermediate species where the polymerization process starts to slow down, while diphenylamine and N,N'-diphenyl-1,4-phenylenediamine decelerate the reaction. Additionally, adding in oligothiophenes is confirmed to reduce the reaction rate. It is also shown that the rate constants measured are consistent with two other methods: (1) monitoring the open circuit potential and (2) measuring the temperature of the solution. These methods were used previously to qualitatively compare the speed of the polymerization reactions. Additionally, the existence of both agglomerated and nanofibrillar polymer morphologies for reactions with slow rate constants is revealed.

This work details the development of a Mizoroki-Heck reaction of aryl halides and a broad range of alkenes that utilizes electrochemistry as a means to promote Ni-catalyzed coupling under mild conditions. Stoichiometric studies implicate low-valent Ni complexes as key intermediates in route to rapid reactions with even unactivated alkenes. As such, electrochemistry is employed to readily provide the reducing potentials necessary to access these reactive intermediates and render the transformation catalytic. Cyclohexenone was found to be an unreactive substrate but a crucial additive that promotes facile electroreduction of the Ni catalyst and functionalization of other alkenes in high yields. Finally, preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that reactions proceed via an electron-chain transfer process that rapidly terminates but is reinitiated upon electroreduction.

Electrochemical Synthesis of Individual Core@Shell and Hollow Ag/Ag2S Nanoparticles	NANO LETTERS			English	Article						nanoparticle collision; electrochemistry; phase transformation; growth kinetics	CORE/SHELL NANOPARTICLES; ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY; SILVER NANOPARTICLES; SULFIDE SOLUTIONS; AG2S; SURFACE; METAL; ELECTRODEPOSITION; COLLISIONS; CORROSION	This letter presents an electrochemical methodology for structure-tunable synthesis, characterization, and kinetic monitoring of metal- semiconductor phase transformations at individual Ag nanoparticles. In the presence of HS- in aqueous solution, the stochastic collision and adsorption of Ag nanoparticles at a Au microelectrode initiates the partial anodic transformation of Ag to Ag2S at each particle. A single continuous current transient is observed for each Ag nanoparticle reacted. The characteristic shapes of the transients are distinct from previously reported amperometric recordings of electrochemical reactions involving single nanoparticles and are highly uniform at a constant applied potential. The average maximum current increases while the event duration decreases as a function of increasing potential. Independent of applied potential, the electrochemical transformation event abruptly stops after converting similar to 80% of the Ag in the nanoparticle to Ag2S, a self-terminating process that does not occur for bulk Ag electrodes under similar conditions. The resulting products are a mixture of core@shell Ag@Ag2S nanoparticles with and without voids in the core, as characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Both the frequency and size of voids increase at more positive potentials. The average size of the core@shell nanoparticles determined by coulometric analysis of the current transients agrees well with TEM measurements.

Here we report an unusual behavior that renders CuO inactive in the process of sodium-ion insertion with a synergistic combination of a variety of synchrotron X-ray microscopic, spectroscopic, and structural probes. We reveal that the "unreactive core" formation is closely associated with the microstructural integrity of battery active materials. In light of these findings, we also demonstrate that this undesirable process can be inhibited by the materials' microstructural design to trigger the potential of high electrochemical properties.

However, the practical battery use of Si is challenged by its low conductivity and drastic volume variation during the Li uptake/release process. Tremendous efforts have been made on shrinking the particle size of Si into nanoscale so that the volume variation could be accommodated. However, the bare nano-Si material would still pulverize upon (de)lithiation. Moreover, it shows an excessive surface area to invite unlimited growth of solid electrolyte interface that hinders the transportation of charge carriers, and an increased interparticle resistance. As a result, the Si nanoparticles gradually lose their electrical contact during the cycling process, which accounts for poor thermodynamic stability and sluggish kinetics of the anode reaction versus Li. To address these problems and improve the Li storage performance of nano-Si anode, proper structural design should be applied on the Si anode. In this perspective, we will briefly review some strategies for improving the electrochemistry versus Li of nano-Si materials and their derivatives, and show opinions on the optimal design of nanostructured Si anode for advanced LIBs.

Intracortical Neural Stimulation With Untethered, Ultrasmall Carbon Fiber Electrodes Mediated by the Photoelectric Effect	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electrochemistry; GCaMP; neuromodulation; photovoltaic effect; temperature-dependent fluorescence; two-photon microscopy	BRAIN-TISSUE; IMPLANTS; MICROSTIMULATION; MICROELECTRODES; ENCAPSULATION; SENSITIVITY; RESPONSES; CALCIUM; IMPACT	Objective: Neural stimulation with tethered, electrically activated probes is damaging to neural tissue and lacks good spatial selectivity and stable chronic performance. The photoelectric effect, which converts incident light into electric potential and heat, provides an opportunity for a tetherless stimulation method. We propose a novel stimulation paradigm that relies on the photoelectric effect to stimulate neurons around a free-floating, ultrasmall (7-8 mu m diameter) carbon fiber probe. Methods: A two-photon microscope induced photo-stimulation with a near-infrared laser. Chronoamperometry and chronopotentiometry were used to characterize the electrochemical properties of photo-stimulation, while the fluorescence of Rhodamine-B was used to quantify temperature changes. Results: Photo-stimulation caused a local cathodic potential pulse with minimal leakage current. Stimulation induced voltage deflections of 0.05-0.4 V in vitro, varying linearly with the power of the laser source (5-40 mW). Temperature increases in the immediate vicinity of the electrode were limited to 2.5 degrees C, suggesting that this stimulation modality can be used without inducing heat damage. Successful stimulation was supported in vivo by increased calcium fluorescence in local neurons at stimulation onset in a transgenic GCaMP-3 mouse model. Furthermore, cells activated by photo-stimulation were closer to the electrode than in electrical stimulation under similar conditions, indicating increased spatial precision. Conclusion: Our results support the hypothesis that the proposed photoelectric method for neural stimulation is effective. Significance: Photoelectric stimulation is precise and avoids the need for a potentially destructive tether, making it a promising alternative to electrical stimulation.

However, the evolution of the point defect profiles in ionic conductors such as yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) can complicate the picture of homogeneous Joule heating and thermal runaway during DC flash sintering. Here, 8 mol% YSZ pellets were partially flash sintered under a DC bias using various current densities and hold times. The electrode geometry was varied to modulate the oxygen ion flux available to the cathode to compare the effects on the resulting oxygen vacancy inhomogeneity. The contribution from fundamental and experimental factors to the cathodic reduction reaction is also discussed, such as interface reaction kinetics and sample geometry. Local reduction of the ceramic was inevitably observed under all current densities and the resulting microstructural inhomogeneity was explained as the result of a transient conductivity asymmetry. This asymmetry was the result of the enhanced electronic conductivity in the cathode region to a value significantly greater than the ionic conductivity of near-stoichiometric YSZ. The link between the local conductivity, voltage and Joule heating is mathematically demonstrated to result in an asymmetric heating profile. (C) 2019 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Numerous strategies have been made to address the remaining challenges such as low electronic conductivity, huge volume change, and sluggish sodium ions kinetics. In spite of impressive advances, a comprehensive understanding of the microstructure-stability correlation remains elusive. Here, the three-dimensional (3D) Fe3S4 flower-like hierarchical materials constructed from two-dimensional (2D) nanosheet building units were synthesized via a facile and cost-effective method. Instead of materials synthesis and performance evaluation, more attentions have been paid on the underlying coupling mechanism between microstructure design, surface chemistry and 3D electronic/ ionic transport pathways. It found that the thin and stable SEI layer generated by ether-based electrolytes contributes to the stable surface chemistry and fast interfacial Na+ ion transport, while 3D hierarchical structure enables short diffusion distance, volume change accomodation as well as stabilizing SEI layer. Taking advantage of the inherent high electronic conductivity in Fe3S4, we have demonstrated the paramount importance of the synergistic strategy to improve the stability of SIBs through X-ray nanotomography. This work explicitly illuminate the electrochemical stability mechanisms of 3D hierarchitectures and resolves new strategies to rational design SIBs anodes.

The charge typically originates from a chemical equilibrium between the reactive surface and certain potential determining ions in the solution (i.e., surface charge regulation). This surface chemistry however, is strongly dependent on the wide variety of interactions between all species in the solution, as well as with the interface. These interactions could be Coulombic and non-Coulombic, and are system-specific. The focus of this study is on the ion valency and its effect on the Coulombic interactions, their interplay with the molecular excluded volume, and attraction in the fluid phase, as well as with the electric double layer interface.

We visualize the morphological defects at multi-scales ranging from the macroscopic composite, particle ensembles, to individual single particles. Particle fracture and interfacial debonding are identified in a large set of tomographic data of active particles. Mechanical failure in the regime near the separator is more severe than toward the current collector. The active particles close to the separator experience deeper charge and discharge over cycles and thus are more mechanically loaded. The difference in the Li activity originates from the polarization of the electrolyte potential and the non-uniform distribution of the activation energy for the charge transfer reaction. We model the kinetics of intergranular fracture and interfacial degradation to confirm that the various Li activities are the major cause of the heterogeneous damage. The interfacial failure may reconstruct the conductive network and redistribute the electrochemical activities that render a dynamic nature of electrochemistry and mechanics evolving over time in the composite electrode. We further quantify the influence of the mechanical damage on the metrics of battery performance. We simulate the electrochemical impedance profile to build a relationship between the interfacial debonding and the impedance of electron transport and surface charge transfer. The mechanical failure disrupts the conduction path of electrons and results in significant polarization and capacity loss in batteries. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

An Enhanced Fuel Cell Dynamic Model With Electrochemical Phenomena Parameterization as Test Bed for Control System Analysis	JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL ENERGY CONVERSION AND STORAGE			English	Article							THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; EXCHANGE; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; LAYER; WATER; SIMULATION; CATHODE	In this work, a model of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is presented. A dynamic performance characterization is performed to assess the cell transient response to input variables. The model used in the simulation considers three different phenomena: mass transfer, thermodynamics, and electrochemistry. The main sources of voltage loss are presented: activation, electrical resistance, and concentration. The model is constructed to avoid the use of fitted parameters, reducing the experimentation required for its validation. Hence, the electrochemical model is parameterized by physical variables, including material properties and geometrical characteristics. The model is demonstrated as a test-bed for PEMFC control system design and evaluation. Results demonstrate that the steady-state and dynamic behavior of the system are represented accurately. A case study is included to show the functionality of the model. In the case study, the effect of the purge valves at the fuel cell discharges is analyzed under different scenarios. Regular purges of the cathode and the anode are shown to achieve a good performance in the system avoiding reactant starvation in the cell. A closed-loop dynamic response is included as an example of the model capabilities for the design of fuel cell control strategies. Two variables were selected to be controlled: voltage and pressure difference across the membrane. A multivariate control strategy was tested and its dynamic response was analyzed. It was found that there was a strong interaction between the control loops, making the control of the system a challenge.

Non-enzymatic glucose sensor of high sensitivity fabricated with direct deposition of Au particles on polyvinylferrocene film modified Pt electrode	CHEMICAL PAPERS			English	Article						Chronoamperometry; Cyclic voltammetry; Glucose sensor; Non-enzymatic; Polyvinylferrocene	AMPEROMETRIC ENZYME ELECTRODE; GLASSY-CARBON ELECTRODE; GRAPHENE OXIDE; GOLD; NANOPARTICLES; ELECTROCHEMISTRY	In the present paper, highly sensitive non-enzymatic sensor was developed by simple method based on direct deposition of gold particles on polyvinylferrocene matrix modified Pt electrode (Au/PVF/Pt) for detection of glucose. The gold particles were generated from potassium tetrachloroaurate (III) (KAuCl4) solution based on optimization of concentration of the solution and growth time of Au particles. The electrochemical characterization and electrocatalytic activities of the proposed sensor were studied with the help of cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry techniques. The Au/PVF/Pt sensor was evaluated on analytical parameters such as sensitivity, selectivity, stability, detection limits, repeatability, and reproducibility. As gold particles provide active sites towards oxidation of glucose, two wide linear ranges, 10-80M and 100-6mM with ultra-sensitivities of 3236.3 and 730.3 AmM(-1)cm(-2)respectively, were observed. Furthermore, limit of detection was calculated as 0.068mM with fast response time of 2s. Additionally, the sensor showed good repeatability and reproducibility with RSD of 3.03 and 2.14% respectively. The as-prepared Au/PVF/Pt sensor was able to show excellent stability and selectivity to glucose exclusively in the presence of other interfering species. Finally, the Au/PVF/Pt sensor could successfully detect glucose in various boxed juices samples. The results obtained from our method were compared to the commercial glucose meter. Hence, the applicability of Au/PVF/Pt sensor can be promising for determination of glucose in various fields such as food, biotechnology, and clinical diagnosis.

Here, we show a strong stress-composition coupling in lithium binary alloys during the lithiation of tin-tin oxide core-shell nanoparticles. Using in situ graphene liquid cell electron microscopy imaging, we visualise the generation of a non-uniform composition field in the nanoparticles during lithiation. Stress models based on density functional theory calculations show that the composition gradient is proportional to the applied stress. Based on this coupling, we demonstrate that we can directionally control the lithium distribution by applying different stresses to lithium alloy materials. Our results provide insights into stress-lithium electrochemistry coupling at the nanoscale and suggest potential applications of lithium alloy nanoparticles.

X-ray structural analysis on a single crystal of PdCl(kappa(3)-N,N,O-dpk-4-abh-H)]center dot H2O center dot dmf (3) established its authenticity, points to keto-enol tautomerization due to solvent-compound interactions and revealed pseudo-coordination of the carbonyl group to the Pd ion. Solid-state infrared measurements confirmed the pseudo coordination of the carbonyl group of dpk-h as evident from the appearance of the nu(C=O) of coordinated dpk-h in close proximity to the nu(C=O) of uncoordinated dpk-h. H-1 NMR measurements on protophilic solutions of 1 and 2 disclosed solvent dependence and keto-enol tautomerization while variable temperature studies established the predominance of the keto form. The electronic absorption spectra of 1 and 2 measured in protophilic solvents confirmed the coordination of the Pd ion to dpk-h as evident from the appearance of d-d and ligand based electronic transitions. The catalytic C-C cross-coupling reactions and electro-catalytic behavior of 1 and 2 toward a proton reduction were investigated and revealed good catalytic properties. Overall rate constants (k(app)) for the electrocatalytic H-2 evolution of (3.39 +/- 0.3) x 10(3) and (4.04 +/- 0.2) x 10(3) M-1 s(-1) were estimated and overpotentials of 157 and 67 mV, and turnover numbers (TON) of 2.0 and 3.2 for 1 and 2, respectively, were determined.

Sterically encumbered beta-diketonates and base metal catalysis	DALTON TRANSACTIONS			English	Article							MOLECULAR-STRUCTURE; C-N; COPPER; CRYSTAL; COBALT; ALKENES; DISPROPORTIONATION; SELECTIVITIES; PERSPECTIVE; REDUCTION	Metal coordination complexes of the sterically hindered beta-diketonate, 2,6-dimesitylbenzoyl pinacolone (esac), are reported for Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn. All four form ML2-type complexes with typical coordination behavior for late-metal beta-diketonates, however the effects on established electrochemistry and reactivity vary somewhat per metal. For example, the striking chemical and electrochemical inertness of Co-II(esac)(2) to oxidation and disproportionation is atypical. Conversely, the behavior of Cu-II(esac)(2) is rather typical relative to other Cu-II(beta-diketonate)(2) complexes. These data suggest a relative disfavoring of certain reaction pathways, and represent an important step in modulating the catalysis of the base metals via sterically hindered beta-diketonates.

The synthetic approaches to solid electrolytes are important for both fundamental research and practical applications. Li1+xAlxTi2-x(PO4)(3) (LATP) and Li1+xAlxGe2-x(PO4)(3) (LAGP) are two representative solid electrolytes with a sodium superionic conductor (NaSICON) structure. Herein, LATP and LAGP solid electrolytes are reviewed from the synthesis perspective, and correlated with their structure and conductive properties, as well as their electrochemical applications in batteries. First, the solid- and liquid-based synthetic methods to LATP and LAGP solid electrolytes and the key influencing factors are described. Second, the crystal structures and phase purities obtained from different synthetic approaches are introduced. Third, the conductive mechanisms, composition effects, and synthetic effects on the conductivities of LATP and LAGP solid electrolytes are compared. Fourth, the electrochemical applications of these two solid electrolytes in full batteries are discussed, including roles as solid electrolytes, composite components in electrodes, and surface coatings on electrodes. In the last section, a brief outlook is provided on the future development of NaSICON-type solid electrolytes for all-solid-state batteries.

A Nucleic Acid Nanostructure Built through On-Electrode Ligation for Electrochemical Detection of a Broad Range of Analytes	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							EMPLOYS STERIC HINDRANCE; MOLECULES; SENSOR; ASSAY; PERFORMANCE; SERUM	For an assay to be most effective in point-of-care clinical analysis, it needs to be economical, simple, generalizable, and free from tedious workflows. While electrochemistry-based DNA sensors reduce instrumental costs and eliminate complicated procedures, there remains a need to address probe costs and generalizability, as numerous probes with multiple conjugations are needed to quantify a wide range of biomarkers. In this work, we have opened a route to circumvent complicated multi conjugation schemes using enzyme-catalyzed probe construction directly on the surface of the electrode. With this, we have created a versatile DNA nanostructure probe and validated its effectiveness by quantification of proteins (streptavidin, anti-digoxigenin, anti-tacrolimus) and small molecules (biotin, digoxigenin, tacrolimus) using the same platform. Tacrolimus, a widely prescribed immunosuppressant drug for organ transplant patients, was directly quantified with electrochemistry for the first time, with the assay range matching the therapeutic index range. Finally, the stability and sensitivity of the probe was confirmed in a background of minimally diluted human serum.

ALD HfO2 Films for Defining Microelectrodes for Electrochemical Sensing and Other Applications	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						atomic layer deposition; hafnium dioxide; electrochemistry; microelectrodes	ATOMIC LAYER DEPOSITION; CYCLIC VOLTAMMETRY; HAFNIUM DIOXIDE; THIN-FILMS; PERFORMANCE; COATINGS; ENCAPSULATION; FABRICATION; DIELECTRICS; MICROSCOPY	Microelectrodes are used in a wide range of applications from analytical electrochemistry and biomolecular sensing to in vivo implants. While a variety of insulating materials have been used to define the microelectrode active area, most are not suitable for nanoscale electrodes (<1 pm2) due to the limited robustness of these films when the film thickness is on the order of the nanoelectrode dimension. In this study, we investigate atomic layer deposited hafnium dioxide (ALD Hf02) as an insulating film to coat planar platinum microelectrodes, with the active areas being defined where the Hf02 is etched. Thermally grown films with thicknesses between 10 and 60 nm were deposited by 100 to 550 ALD cycles and were initially characterized by measuring their standard electrical properties and imaging incipient texture development. Electrochemical measurements on the structures were made, including linear sweep voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, which identified the presence of pinholes in films deposited over the range of 100 to 350 cycles, resulting in leakage. These measurements also suggest a lower limit to the size of microelectrodes below which the electrochemical current detected is no longer dominated by that through the exposed active area. A bilayer insulator comprising ALD Hf02 coated with parylene-C was investigated to minimize the pinhole leakage. Steady-state currents were measured for different electrode areas, qualitatively agreeing with the theory for areas down to pm2. For sub-square micrometer electrode areas, bilayer-insulated devices with parylene-C apertures that exposed the smallest microelectrode area showed measured currents that were consistent with extrapolations, indicating that it reduces leakage through Hf02.

In the presence of stoichiometric Pt-IV oxidants, Pt-II ions are capable of catalyzing this reaction in aqueous solutions at modest temperatures. Practical implementation of this chemistry requires a viable strategy for replacing or regenerating the expensive Pt-IV oxidant. Herein, we establish an electrochemical strategy for continuous regeneration of the Pt-IV oxidant to furnish overall electrochemical methane oxidation. We show that Cl-adsorbed Pt electrodes catalyze facile oxidation of Pt-II to Pt-IV at low overpotential without concomitant methanol oxidation. Exploiting this facile electrochemistry, we maintain the Pt-II/IV ratio during Pt-II-catalyzed methane oxidation via in situ monitoring of the solution potential coupled with dynamic modulation of the electric current. This approach leads to sustained methane oxidation catalysis with 70% selectivity for methanol.	[Kim, R.

MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry-based quantification of C-peptide in diabetes patients	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MASS SPECTROMETRY			English	Article						6-Aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate; C-peptide; diabetes; immunoaffinity enrichment; ionization; MALDI-TOF MS	ASSISTED-LASER-DESORPTION/IONIZATION; 6-AMINOQUINOLYL-N-HYDROXYSUCCINIMIDYL CARBAMATE; HUMAN PLASMA; INSULIN; ELECTROCHEMILUMINESCENCE; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; DERIVATIZATION; PROINSULIN; COMPLEX; MS	Background Serum C-peptide concentrations reflect insulin secretion and beta cell function and can be used to diagnose and distinguish type-1 and type-2 diabetes. C-peptide is a more accurate indicator of insulin status than direct insulin measurement for monitoring patients with diabetes. However, the current methods available for C-peptide quantification exhibit poor reproducibility, are costly, and require highly trained laboratory personnel. Here, we have developed and evaluated a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)-based assay to standardize C-peptide measurements, providing highly accurate and comparable results across testing systems and laboratories. Methods C-peptide from human serum was enriched using antibody-conjugated magnetic beads. The eluted isolates were further modified with 6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate (AQC) to enhance the ionization of naturally acidic C-peptide. After desalting with ZipTips, the samples were subjected to MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Recombinant human C-peptide was used to develop the assay, and a heavy isotope labeled human C-peptide was used as an internal standard for quantification. Results The MALDI-TOF MS method was validated in accordance with the restrictions of the device, with a limit of quantitation of 25 pmol/L. A correlation between the MAL-DI-TOF MS assay and a reference method was conducted using patient samples. The resulting regression revealed good agreement. Conclusions A simple, high-throughput, cost effective and quantitative MALDI-TOF MS C-peptide assay has been successfully developed and validated in clinical serum samples.

The complex has the general formula of [((N<^>C<^>N)Pt)(2)(mu-pz)][PF6] where N<^>C<^>N = 1,3-di(2-pyridyl)benzene and mu-pz = 3,5-diphenylpyrazolate. The X-ray structure shows that the bridging pyrazolate ligand causes a close Pt-Pt interaction of 3.05(7) angstrom. The emission profile of the complex was determined in solution, glassy 2-methyltetrahydrofurane at 77 K, and the solid state at both room temperature and 77 K. Each emission profile displayed a strong red metal-metal-to-ligand charge transfer while the solution and glassy 2-methyltetrahydrofurane emission profiles also displayed a ligand-centred transition. The absolute quantum yields of the complex in solution and the solid state at room temperate are 86% and 39%, respectively. Light-emitting electrochemical cells (LEECs) of [((N<^>C<^>N)Pt)(2)(mu-pz)][PF6] were fabricated which displayed appreciable electroluminescence, among the brightest and most efficient LEECs from dinuclear compounds to date.

Herein, we propose a novel strategy employing single-particle electrochemistry showing that it is possible to measure reactivity, speciation, and loading of As3+ on individual NPs, using cerium oxide (CeO2) as a model system. We demonstrate that redox reactions and adsorption processes can be electrochemically quantified with high sensitivity via the oxidation of As3+ to As5+ at 0.8 V versus Ag/AgCl or the reduction of As3+ to As-0 at -0.3 V (vs Ag/AgCl) generated by collisions of single particles at an ultramicroelectrode. Using collision electrochemistry, As3+ concentrations were determined in basic conditions showing a maximum adsorption capacity at pH 8. In acidic environments (pH < 4), a small fraction of As3+ was oxidized to As5+ by surface Ce4+ and further adsorbed onto the CeO2 surface as a As5+ bidentate complex. The frequency of current spikes (oxidative or reductive) was proportional to the concentration of As3+ accumulated onto the NPs and was found to be representative of the As3+ concentration in solution. Given its sensitivity and speciation capability, the method can find many applications in the analytical, materials, and environmental chemistry fields where there is a need to quantify the reactivity and surface interactions of NPs. This is the first study demonstrating the capability of single-particle collision electrochemistry to monitor the interaction of heavy metal ions with metal oxide NPs. This knowledge is critical to the fundamental understanding of the risks associated with the release of NPs into the environment for their safe implementation and practical use.

Tuning two-electron transfer in terpyridine-based platinum(ii) pincer complexes	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							ELECTRON-TRANSFER REACTIONS; STRUCTURAL CONSEQUENCES; SPECTROSCOPIC PROPERTIES; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; LUMINESCENCE; REDUCTION; HAPTICITY; HYDROGEN; SUBSTITUENTS; EMISSION	An important factor in obtaining reversible multi-electron transfer is overcoming large changes in coordination geometry. One strategy is to use ligands that can support the geometries favored before and after the electron transfer. Pip(2)NCN(-) pincer and terpyridine ligands are used to support square planar Pt(ii) and octahedral Pt(iv). For the Pt(ii) complexes, [Pt(Z-pip(2)NCN)(R-tpy)](+) (Z = NO2, MeO, H; R = H, tertyl butyl, tolyl), H-1 NMR spectroscopy shows that the Z-pip(2)NCN(-) ligand is monodentate whereas the R-terpyridyl ligand is tridentate. The availability of flanking piperidyl groups of the monodentate pincer ligand is essential for the stabilization of the metal center upon oxidation. Pt(Z-pip(2)NCN)(R-tpy)(+) complexes undergo two-electron platinum centered oxidation near 0.4 V and two Pt(tpy) centered reductions near -1.0 V and -1.5 V. An estimate of n(ox)/n(red) = 1.8 is consistent with an oxidation that involves two-electron transfer per Pt center. Variation in the pincer-(Z) and terpyridine-(R) substituents allows for tuning of the oxidation process over a 260 mV range and the two reduction processes over ranges of 230 mV (first reduction) and 290 mV (second reduction step).

The framework crystal structure of PBAs mainly benefits from the six-fold coordinated cyano functional groups. In this study, in-plane tetracyanonickelate was utilized to engineer an organic linker and design a family of four-fold coordinated PBAs (FF-PBAs; Fe2+Ni(CN)(4), MnNi(CN)(4), Fe3+Ni(CN)(4), CuNi(CN)(4), CoNi(CN)(4), ZnNi(CN)(4), and NiNi(CN)(4)), which showed an interesting two-dimensional (2D) crystal structure. It was found that these FF-PBAs could be utilized as cathode materials of Li-ion batteries, and the Ni/Fe2+ system exhibited superior electrochemical properties compared to the others with a capacity of 137.9 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 100 mA g(-1). Furthermore, after a 5000-cycle long-term repeated charge/discharge measurement, the Ni/Fe2+ system displayed a capacity of 60.3 mA h g(-1) with a coulombic efficiency of 98.8% at a current density of 1000 mA g(-1). In addition, the capacity of 86.1% was preserved at 1000 mA g(-1) as compared with that at 100 mA g(-1), implying a good rate capability. These potential capacities can be ascribed to an in situ reduction of Li+ in the interlayer of Ni/Fe2+ instead of the formation of other compounds with the host material according to ex situ XRD characterization. These specially designed FF-PBAs are expected to inspire new concepts in electrochemistry and other applications requiring 2D materials.

Although considerable research is devoted to studying and improving the round-trip efficiency of SFBs, little attention is paid to the device lifetime. Herein, a neutral pH aqueous electrolyte SFB with robust organic redox couples and inexpensive silicon-based photoelectrodes is demonstrated. Enabled by the excellent stability of both electrolytes and protected photoelectrodes, this SFB device exhibits not only unprecedented stable continuous cycling performance over 200 h but also a capacity utilization rate higher than 80%. Moreover, through comprehensive study on the working mechanisms of SFBs, a new theory based on instantaneous solar-to-output electricity efficiency toward more optimized device design is developed and a significantly improved solar-to-output electricity efficiency of 5.4% from single-junction silicon photoelectrodes is realized. The design principles presented in this work for extending device lifetime and boosting round trip energy efficiency will make SFBs more competitive for off-grid applications.

However, the varying potential during CV scans leads to unwanted SPR background changes and complicates interpretation of SPR signals. In this work, we show that, when SPR is coupled with CV, the background correction for underpotential deposition of copper and electropolymerization of aniline is either inaccurate or difficult to perform. For accurate thickness measurements of electrodeposited films, potential-step (PS) chronoamperometry is a method of choice to combine with SPR. The theory that interprets double-layer charging is used to explain the advantage of PS chronoamperometry over CV in quantifying the thickness of electrodeposited thin films. The influence of the double-layer charging on the potential-induced SPR signal change was analyzed, and the results were used to optimize experimental parameters for PS-SPR. Overall, PS-SPR is easier to operate, simpler in data interpretation, and more accurate for the film thickness measurement.

In this study, the redox chemistry of Se on galena is investigated over a range of environmentally relevant Eh and pH conditions (+0.3 to -0.6 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode, SHE; pH 4.6) using a combination of electrochemical, spectroscopic, and computational approaches. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements reveal one anodic/cathodic peak pair at a midpoint potential of +30 mV (vs. SHE) that represents reduction and oxidation between HSeO3- and H2Se/HSe-. Two peak pairs with midpoint potentials of -400 and -520 mV represent the redox transformation from Se(0) to HSe- and H2Se species, respectively. The changes in Gibbs free energies of adsorption of Se species on galena surfaces as a function of Se oxidation state were modeled using quantum-mechanical calculations and the resulting electrochemical peak shifts are (-0.17 eV for HSeO3-/H2Se, -0.07 eV for HSeO3-/HSe-, 0.15 eV for Se(0)/HSe-, and -0.15 eV for Se(0)/H2Se). These shifts explain deviation between Nernstian equilibrium redox potentials and observed midpoint potentials. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis reveals the formation of Se(0) potentials below -100 mV and Se(0) and Se(-II) species at potentials below -400 mV.

To study the behavior of ion transport and reaction in these applications, we report the use of a focused ion beam of Le to locally insert controlled quantities of lithium with high spatial resolution into electrochemically relevant materials in vacuo. To benchmark the technique, we present results on direct write lithiation of 35 nm thick crystalline silicon membranes using a 2 keV beam of Li+ at doses up to 10(18) cm(-2) (10(4) nm(-2)). We confirm quantitative sub pm control of lithium insertion and characterize the concomitant morphological, structural, and functional changes of the system using a combination of electron and scanning probe microscopy. We observe saturation of interstitial lithium in the silicon membrane at approximate to 10% dopant number density and spillover of excess lithium onto the membrane's surface. The implanted Le is demonstrated to remain electrochemically active. This technique will enable controlled studies and improve understanding of Le ion interaction with local defect structures and interfaces in electrode and solid-electrolyte materials.

Enhancing Lithium Insertion with Electrostatic Nanoconfinement in a Lithography Patterned Precision Cell	ACS NANO			English	Article						lithium insertion; nanoconfinement; lithography; electrical double layer overlap; finite element simulation	ELECTRICAL ENERGY-STORAGE; PROPYLENE CARBONATE; ION-TRANSPORT; ETHYLENE CARBONATE; BATTERY; ANATASE; PERCHLORATE; FILMS	The rapidly growing demand for portable electronics, electric vehicles, and grid storage drives the pursuit of high-performance electrical energy storage (EES). A key strategy for improving EES performance is exploiting nanostructured electrodes that present nanoconfined environments of adjacent electrolytes, with the goal to decrease ion diffusion paths and increase active surface areas. However, fundamental gaps persist in understanding the interface governed electrochemistry in such nanoconfined geometries, in part because of the imprecise and variable dimension control. Here, we report quantification of lithium insertion under nanoconfinement of the electrolyte in a precise lithography-patterned nanofluidic cell. We show a mechanism that enhances ion insertion under nanoconfinement, namely, selective ion accumulation when the confinement length is comparable to the electrical double layer thickness. The nanofabrication approach with uniform and accurate dimensional control provides a versatile model system to explore fundamental mechanisms of nanoscale electrochemistry, which could have an impact on practical energy storage systems.

The high energy density results from the conversion mechanism that lithium-sulfur cells utilize. The sulfur cathode, being naturally abundant and environmentally friendly, makes lithium-sulfur batteries a potential next-generation energy-storage technology. The current state of the research indicates that lithium-sulfur cells are now at the point of transitioning from laboratory-scale devices to a more practical energy-storage application. Based on similar electrochemical conversion reactions, the low-cost sulfur cathode can be coupled with a wide range of metallic anodes, such as sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, and aluminum. These new "metal-sulfur" systems exhibit great potential in either lowering the production cost or producing high energy density. Inspired by the rapid development of lithium-sulfur batteries and the prospect of metal-sulfur cells, here, over 450 research articles are summarized to analyze the research progress and explore the electrochemical characteristics, cell-assembly parameters, cell-testing conditions, and materials design. In addition to highlighting the current research progress, the possible future areas of research which are needed to bring conversion-type lithium-sulfur and other metal-sulfur batteries into the market are also discussed.

In this study, bipolar electrochemistry concept is utilized to design a single-step and controllable process for simultaneously exfoliating a graphite source and depositing both graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide layers on conductive substrates. The electrochemical analysis carried out on symmetric cells revealed an areal capacitance of 1.932 mF cm(-2) for the high-quality reduced graphene oxide deposited on the negative feeding electrode, and 0.404 mF cm(-2) for the graphene oxide deposited on the positive feeding electrode at a scan rate of 2 mV s(-1). The devices also showed high stability for periodic and repeated constant current charging/discharging cycles which is suitable for energy storage in supercapacitors. In the frequency domain, cutoff frequencies of 1820 and 1157 Hz at 4-5 degrees impedance phase angle were obtained for the positive and negative feeding electrode-based devices, respectively, which is a promising characteristic for alternating current filtering applications.

A Versatile Method for Ammonia Detection in a Range of Relevant Electrolytes via Direct Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Techniques	ACS CATALYSIS			English	Article						nitrogen reduction; ammonia detection; NMR; electrocatalysis; nonaqueous electrochemistry	ELECTROCHEMICAL REDUCTION; BERTHELOT REACTION; CARBON-DIOXIDE; NITROGEN; ELECTROSYNTHESIS; PRESSURE; NMR; TEMPERATURE; SUPPRESSION; TURNOVER	Electrocatalytic N-2 reduction to ammonia has recently attracted a great deal of interest as a possible renewable energy-driven alternative to the Haber-Bosch process. However, the detection of NH3 after attempting electrocatalytic reduction of N-2 can be hampered by low NH3 yields, ambient NH3 contamination, and the need for multistep chemical separation of NH3 from the electrolyte. Herein, we report a frequency-selective pulse nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) method and quantify the efficacy of this method to measure the concentration of NH3 (present in the assay as NH4+) in an electrolyte after electrocatalysis. This NMR method was demonstrated to be effective in a variety of nondeuterated, nonaqueous and aqueous electrolytes, and did not require the separation of NH3 from the electrolyte. NH3 sensitivity down to 1 mu M was readily achieved with isotopic and chemical specificity. Compatible electrolytes and solvents included ethanol, tetrahydrofuran, dimethyl sulfoxide, acetonitrile, propylene carbonate, diethyl either, hexanes, and water. The efficacy of the commonly employed Berthelot method was also quantified and compared to the NMR method in a range of nonaqueous and aqueous electrolytes, including ethanol, THF, propylene carbonate, and water.

Consequently, the inherent functionality of oxides to intercalate Mg2+ remains in question. By conducting electrochemistry in a chemically and anodically stable ionic liquid electrolyte, we report that, at 110 degrees C, layered alpha-V2O5 is indeed capable of reversibly intercalating 1 mol Mg2+ per unit formula, to accumulate capacities above 280 mAh g(-1). Multimodal characterization confirmed intercalation of Mg2+ by probing the elemental, redox, and morphological changes undergone by the oxide. After cycling at 110 degrees C, the electrochemical activity at room temperature was significantly enhanced. The results renew prospects for functional Mg rechargeable batteries surpassing the levels of energy density of current Li-ion batteries.

The realization of future hydrogen economy necessitates the development of low-cost and competent electrocatalysts for both HER and HOR. Herein, we report that partial nitridation of cobalt nanoparticles on current collectors results in rich Co2N/Co interfacial sites, which exhibit bifunctional activity for hydrogen electrochemistry, rivaling the state-of-the-art Pt counterparts tested under similar conditions. Our combined experimental and theoretical computation results demonstrate that Co2N/Co interfacial sites not only possess optimal hydrogen adsorption energy but also facilitate water adsorption and dissociation on the catalyst surface, all of which are beneficial to the electrocatalytic performance for both HER and HOR. In addition, our Co2N/Co electrocatalysts also demonstrate great tolerance against CO poisoning during long-term H-2 oxidation.

However, most of the prelithiation reagents developed so far are highly reactive and sensitive to oxygen and moisture and therefore difficult for practical battery application. In this work, we developed a facile prelithiation strategy using lithium naphthalenide to fully prelithiate sulfur-poly(acrylonitrile) (S-PAN) composite into a Li2S-PAN cathode and to partially prelithiate nanosilicon into a LixSi anode, which leads to a new version of silicon/sulfur Li-ion battery. This LixSi/Li2S-PAN battery can demonstrate a high specific energy of 710 Wh kg(-1), with a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 93.5% and a considerable cyclability. Also, this chemical prelithiation approach is mild, efficient, and widely applicable to a large range of Li-deficient electrodes, opening up new possibilities for development of low cost, environmentally benign, and high capacity Li-ion batteries.

Concurrently, sustainability concerns of fossil-based energy resources have motivated the use of renewable and reusable energy resources, and the use of more efficient energy-converting and energy-consuming systems. Consequently, for the past decade, there have been major theoretical and experimental advances in (1) energy generation from renewable and reusable resources and (2) energy-consuming and energy-converting devices. This review article focuses on the recent theoretical advances in renewable energy conversion devices such as photovoltaic and fuel cells, and in energy storage devices such as rechargeable batteries, flow batteries, and supercapacitors. Due to similar chemistry, electrochemistry, and physics of these systems, modeling similarities between different energy systems are highlighted. This review puts into perspective how first-principles mathematical modeling has contributed to systematic advances in the optimal design, operation, and integration of these systems.

Herein, we report a copper phthalocyanine based 2D conjugated MOF with square-planar cobalt bis(dihydroxy) complexes (Co-O-4) as linkages (PcCu-O-8-Co) and layer-stacked structures prepared via solvothermal synthesis. PcCu-O-8-Co 2D MOF mixed with carbon nanotubes exhibits excellent electrocatalytic ORR activity (E-1/2=0.83 V vs. RHE, n=3.93, and j(L)=5.3 mA cm(-2)) in alkaline media, which is the record value among the reported intrinsic MOF electrocatalysts. Supported by in situ Raman spectro-electrochemistry and theoretical modeling as well as contrast catalytic tests, we identified the cobalt nodes as ORR active sites. Furthermore, when employed as a cathode electrocatalyst for zinc-air batteries, PcCu-O-8-Co delivers a maximum power density of 94 mW cm(-2), outperforming the state-of-the-art Pt/C electrocatalysts (78.3 mW cm(-2)).

In this work, using two representative additives that have been extensively for superior electrochemical performances, i.e., vinylene carbonate (VC) and LiPO2F2 (LPF), we thoroughly investigated the fundamental chemistry and electrochemistry involved in Li-ion battery environment and explored the underneath mechanism. The analyses performed on bulk electrolyte and surfaces of both graphitic anode and transition metal oxide cathode reveal complicated reaction cascades among these additives with electrolyte components as well as electrode materials. It was found that the effectiveness of these additives lies not only in how they participate the interphasial chemistries, but also in how they suppress the major side reactions between the bulk electrolyte solvents, the trans-esterification.

Microstructure-dependent electrochemical properties of chemical-vapor deposited poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) films	SYNTHETIC METALS			English	Article						Conductive polymer; PEDOT; Oxidative CVD; Microstructure; Electrochemistry	INDIUM-TIN OXIDE; THERMOELECTRIC PROPERTIES; CONDUCTING POLYMERS; CHARGE-TRANSPORT; THIN-FILMS; PERFORMANCE; PSS; POLYMERIZATION; ENHANCEMENT; DEGRADATION	Conductive polymer electrodes hold exceptional promise in energy conversion technologies and bioelectronics due to the inherent mechanical flexibility and synthetic tunability of physical, chemical, and electronic properties. Solution-processing is favorable to retain low-cost but can often result in heterogeneity of physical and electronic structure due to non-conjugated side chains and polyionic dopants creating insulating domains. Such a complex landscape limits control and systematic understanding of fundamental properties including electrical and ionic transport and rates of electron transfer central to overall device efficiencies. Oxidative chemical vapor deposition (oCVD) offers a promising route to simultaneously synthesize and deposit conductive polymer films at low temperatures (< 150 degrees C) with controllable microstructure. Herein we use the oCVD technique to synthesize and deposit different paracrystalline films of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene). Using grazing incidence wide-angle x-ray scattering, we demonstrate three different orientations of the pi-pi packing direction, relative to the surface normal, to yield thin films with face-on, edge-on, and isotropic character. These different microstructures have direct impact on the electrochemical conditioning of the redox properties of the films. We show that electrochemical properties, as defined by energy and power density, are highest for crystalline materials with edge-on orientation to facilitate ion transport while still retaining reasonable electrical conductivity.

High Mg 5xxx series Al alloys are known to exhibit decreased resistance to intergranular corrosion and intergranular stress corrosion cracking due to the formation of the active Al3Mg2-beta phase on grain boundaries when exposed to slightly elevated temperatures for prolonged periods of time, a phenomenon known as sensitization. High resolution fracture mechanics based experiments conducted at constant AK and R-ratio under full immersion in 3.5 wt% NaCl show that da/dN in a heavily sensitized microstructure increases by an order of magnitude for each order of magnitude decrease in fatigue loading frequency, while da/dN for the as-received and unsensitized microstructure has little to no frequency dependence. Futhermore, for higher frequency loading at 1 Hz, da/dN for the highly sensitized microstructures is one order of magnitude higher than the as-received microstructure; while for the low frequency loading at 0.01 Hz, da/dN for the highly sensitized microstructure is three orders of magnitude higher than the as-received microstructure. The findings of this study suggest that typical higher frequency laboratory testing studies at 10 Hz may severely underestimate fatigue life under service relevant loading conditions.

Herein, we have rationally designed and constructed a tubular coaxial-electrode copper ionization cell (CECIC) that enables superior disinfection performance (similar to 6-log removal of E. coli) with a very low effluent copper concentration (similar to 200 mu g/L). A non-uniform electric field with enhanced strength near the center electrode is generated in the chamber attributed to the coaxial center-outer electrode configuration. Exposure to the strong electric field subsequently increases the permeability of cell membrane, the excessive uptake of Cu ions into microbes, and thus the reinforced bacteria inactivation. The in-situ ionization results in a Cu ion concentration gradient with higher concentrations in the regions closer to the center. In addition, being driven by the electrophoresis and dielectrophoresis forces, the bacterial cells are transported to the vicinity of the center electrode, where both the electric field strength and Cu ion concentration are higher. These mechanisms in the CECIC synergistically result in the high inactivation efficiency with low Cu concentration in the effluent. The low-cost, high-efficiency, and disinfection-byproduct-free CECIC has shown significant potential in point-of-use applications.

Therefore, in the present study, nano-structured bioelectrochemical platforms were designed for sensing the formation of biofilm of P. aeruginosa along with monitoring its electrochemical/morphological changes under different stresses. Through the assay optimizations, the performances of different electrode modifiers such as reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets, hyperbranched chitosan nanoparticles (HBCs NPs), and rGO-HBCs nano-composite were tested to assess the influence of the electrode materials on biofilm progression. As a need for the anodic respiration, the bioelectrochemical responses of the adhered bacterial cells changed from a non-electrochemically active (planktonic state) to an electrochemically active (biofilm matrix) state. Our results demonstrated that electrode modifications with conductive nanostructured elements is highly sensitive and enable direct assay for the biofilm formation without any preachments. Consequently, the morphological changes in bacterial cell wall, upon switching from the planktonic state to the biofilm matrix were imaged using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the changes in cell wall chemical composition were monitored by the Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). Thus, the designed microbial electrochemical system (MES) was successfully used to monitor changes in the biofilm matrix under different stresses through direct measurements of electron exchanges.

Six commercially available bis(phosphino) ferrocene ligands: 1,1'-bis(di-tert-butylphosphino)ferrocene (dtbpf), 1,1'-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (dppf), 1,1'-bis(dicylohexylphosphino)ferrocene (dcpf), 1,1'-bis(diiso-propylphosphino)ferrocene (dippf), 1-diphenylphosphino-1'-di-tert-butylphosphinoferrocene (dppdtbpf) and 1,1'-bis(5-methyl-2-furanylphosphino)ferrocene (dfurpf) were employed in this study. In addition to the previously reported [Au2Cl2(mu-PP)] (PP = dtbpf, dppf, dcpf, dippf or dppdtbpf) compounds, [Au2Cl2(mu-dfurpf)] was synthesized and characterized by NMR spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and X-ray crystallography. All of these gold compounds react with Na[BArF24] (BArF24 = tetrakis(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl) phenyl) borate) to remove a chloride and yield the cationic monochlorides, [Au-2(mu-Cl)(mu-PP)] (+). The effectiveness of the [Au2Cl2(mu-PP)] and [Au-2(mu-Cl)(mu-PP)][BArF24], either pre-formed or generated in situ, compounds for the catalytic intramolecular alkyne hydroalkoxylation of (Z)-3-methylpent-2-en-4-yn-1-ol was examined in CDCl3 and toluene-d(8). The ring-closing of N-(prop-2-yn-1-yl) benzamide was also examined and was efficiently carried out in toluene-d(8) using [Au-2(mu-Cl)(mu-PP)][BArF24] (PP = dtbpf, dppf, dcpf, dippf, dppdtbpf or dfurpf). In addition, [Au2Cl2(mu-dppe)] and [Au-2(mu-Cl)(mu-dppe)][BArF24] were examined as catalysts for these ring-closing reactions in order to determine if the ferrocene backbone of the bis(phosphino) ferrocene ligands was important for catalysis.

Amorphous carbon (aC) films are an attractive alternative to metal oxides for the preparation of chemically modified electrodes, with surfaces and surface chemistries that are stable under atmospheric conditions and in solution. Here, we prepared azide-terminated aC films, which were further modified with a copper catalyzed azide-alkyne click reaction. We utilized X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry to show this modification strategy was selective to films containing azide group, enabling a new means of preparing modified aC electrodes.

Control of dopant crystallinity in electrochemically treated cuprate thin films	PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS			English	Article							OXYGEN; INTERCALATION; OXIDATION; ELECTRON; ORDER; LA2CUO4+DELTA; TRANSITION; SCATTERING	We present a methodology based on ex situ (postgrowth) electrochemistry to control the oxygen concentration in thin films of the superconducting oxide La2CuO4+y grown epitaxially on substrates of isostructural LaSrAlO4. The superconducting transition temperature, which depends on the oxygen concentration, can be tuned by adjusting the pH level of the base solution used for the electrochemical reaction. As our main finding, we demonstrate that the dopant oxygens can either occupy the interstitial layer in an orientationally disordered state or organize into a crystalline phase via a mechanism in which dopant oxygens are inserted into the substrate, changing the lattice symmetry of both the substrate and the epitaxial film. We discuss this mechanism, and we describe the resulting methodology as a platform to be explored in thin films of other transition-metal oxides.

Electrochemical Characterization of Marinobacter atlanticus Strain CP1 Suggests a Role for Trace Minerals in Electrogenic Activity	FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH			English	Article						marinobacter; bioelectrochemical system (BES); biofilm; microbial electrochemistry; mineral cycling	IRON-SULFUR; SP-NOV.; GENERATION; BIOFILM	The marine heterotroph, Marinobacter atlanticus strain CP1, was recently isolated from the electroautotrophic Biocathode MCL community, named for the three most abundant members: Marinobacter, an uncharacterized member of the Chromatiaceae, and Labrenzia. Biocathode MCL catalyzes the production of cathodic current coupled to carbon fixation through the activity of the uncharacterized Chromatiaceae, renamed as "Candidatus Tenderia electrophaga," but the contribution of M. atlanticus is currently unknown. Here, we report on the electrochemical characterization of pure culture M. atlanticus biofilms grown under aerobic conditions and supplemented with succinate as a carbon source at applied potentials ranging from 160 to 510 mV vs. SHE, and on three different electrode materials (graphite, carbon cloth, and indium tin oxide). M. atlanticus was found to produce either cathodic or anodic current that was an order of magnitude lower than that of the Biocathode MCL community depending on the oxygen concentration, applied potential, and electrode material. Cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), and square wave voltammetry (SWV) were performed to characterize putative redox mediators at the electrode surface; however no definitive redox peaks were observed. No effect on current was observed when genes encoding a putative rubredoxin (ACP86_RS07295), as well as a putative NADH: flavorubredoxin oxidoreductase (ACP86_RS07290), were deleted to evaluate their role in EET. The addition of either riboflavin or excess trace mineral solution increased anodic current by ca. an order of magnitude under the conditions in which Biocathode MCL is typically grown. These results indicate that M. atlanticus has a non-negligible ability to utilize electrodes as an electron acceptor, which can be enhanced by the presence of excess trace minerals already available in the growth medium. The ability of M. atlanticus to utilize trace minerals as electron shuttles with extracellular electron acceptors may have broader implications for its natural role in biogeochemical cycling.

Tailoring Two-Electron-Donating Phenothiazines To Enable High Concentration Redox Electrolytes for Use in Nonaqueous Redox Flow Batteries	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							RENEWABLE ENERGY; CATHOLYTE; ANOLYTE; STORAGE; DENSITY; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; ANTHRAQUINONE; PERFORMANCE; PERSISTENT; STABILITY	This study aims to advance our understanding of the physical and electrochemical behavior of nonaqueous redox electrolytes at elevated concentrations and to develop experimentally informed structure-property relationships that may ultimately enable deterministic design of soluble multielectron-transfer organic redox couples for use in redox flow batteries. To this end, we functionalized a phenothiazine core to simultaneously impart two desired properties: high solubility and multiple electron transfer. Specifically, we report the synthesis, solubility, and electrochemical analysis of two new phenothiazine derivatives, 3,7-dimethoxy-N-(2-(2methoxyethoxy)ethyl)phenothiazine and N-ethyl-3,7-bis(2(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)phenothiazine, both of which are two-electron donors that are miscible with nonaqueous electrolytes. This dual-property improvement compared to previous phenothiazine derivatives allows for extended symmetric flow cell experiments for 460 h of cycling of a multielectron transfer system at high concentrations (0.3 M active material, 0.6 M faradaic concentration), better representing practical devices.

Although many strategies have been proposed to restrain the shuttle of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) through physical trapping and chemical binding, the sluggish kinetics of PS conversion still degrade the capacity, rate, and cycling performance of Li-S batteries. Herein, a novel kind of few-layer BN with engineered nitrogen vacancies (v-BN) has been developed as a cathode matrix for Li-S batteries. The positive vacancies in the BN nanosheets not only promote the immobilization and conversion of LiPSs, but also accelerate the lithium ion diffusion in cathode electrodes. Compared with pristine BN, the v-BN cathodes exhibit higher initial capacities from 775 mA h g(-1) to 1262 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C and a high average coulombic efficiency of over 98 % during 150 cycles. Upon increasing the current density to 1 C, the cell still preserves a capacity of 406 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles, exhibiting a capacity decay of only 0.084 % per cycle. The new vacancy-engineered material provides a promising method for achieving excellent performance in Li-S batteries.

Ligand Noninnocence in Cobalt Dipyrrin-Bisphenols: Spectroscopic, Electrochemical, and Theoretical Insights Indicating an Emerging Analogy with Corroles	INORGANIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article							ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; COMPLEXES; AZIRIDINATION; DERIVATIVES; EPOXIDATION; CHEMISTRY; CATALYSIS; SENSORS	Three cobalt dipyrrin-bisphenol (DPPCo) complexes with different meso-aryl groups (pentafluorophenyl, phenyl, and mesityl) were synthesized and characterized based on their electrochemistry and spectroscopic properties in nonaqueous media. Each DPPCo undergoes multiple oxidations and reductions with the potentials, reversibility, and number of processes depending on the specific solution conditions, the specific macrocyclic substituents, and the type and number of axially coordinated ligands on the central cobalt ion. Theoretical calculations of the compounds with different coordination numbers are given in the current study in order to elucidate the cobalt-ion oxidation state and the innocence or noninnocence of the macrocyclic ligand as a function of the changes in the solvent properties and degree of axial coordination. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of the compounds are obtained to experimentally assess the electron spin state. An X-ray structure of the six-coordinate complex is also presented. The investigated chemical properties of DPPCo compounds under different solution conditions are compared to those of cobalt corroles, where the macrocycle and metal ion also possess formal 3- and 3+ oxidation states in their air-stable forms.

Evidence for Reagent-Induced Spin-State Switching in Tripodal Fe(II) Iminopyridine Complexes	INORGANIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article							POST-SYNTHETIC MODIFICATION; TRANSITION-METAL-COMPLEXES; GAUSSIAN-BASIS SETS; MOLECULAR CALCULATIONS; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; CROSSOVER BEHAVIOR; IRON(II) COMPLEXES; LIGAND; FAMILY; MAGNETOGENESIS	We present evidence of a spin-state change that accompanies desilylation reactions performed on two related Fe(II) iminopyridine coordination complexes. To probe these systems, we performed titrations with CsF in solution and analyzed the speciation with in situ magnetometry, electrochemistry, and mass spectrometry techniques. We find that pendant tert-butyldimethylsilyl groups are readily cleaved under these conditions, and the resulting desilylated complexes exhibit overall decreased solution magnetic susceptibility values. Density functional theory and ab initio computations probe the impact of substituent identity (prior to- and post-desilylation) on the metal-ligand sigma-donor and pi-acceptor bonding properties. We attribute the observed spin-state changes to the decrease in entropy associated with the conformational freedom of the silylated high-spin complex, resulting in a more favored low-spin state upon desilylation.

However, most biofuel cells generate a low power output, limiting their practical applications. Here, we introduce a highperformance biofuel cell based on gold nanoparticle-modified carbon nanotube hybrid fibers. These hybrid electrodes could be converted into anodes through additional enzyme deposition and used directly as cathodes, allowing notable oxygen reduction reaction activity as well as high electrical conductivity (similar to 6100 S cm(-1)). The formed hybrid biofuel cell, composed of an enzymatic anode and a gold nanoparticle-coated carbon fiber cathode, provides an outstanding stationary power output of 1.2 mW cm(-2) under a fixed external resistance (cyclic voltammetry measurement-2.1 mW cm(-2)) at 300 mmol L-1 glucose. Furthermore, these one-dimensional hybrid electrodes with extremely high electrical conductivity can be widely applied in various wire-type electrochemical devices.

Modeling the Effect of Lithium Superoxide Solvation and Surface Reduction Kinetics on Discharge Capacity in Lithium-Oxygen Batteries	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							LI-O-2 BATTERIES; DIMETHYL-SULFOXIDE; ELECTROLYTE; GROWTH; SOLVENTS; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; RECHARGEABILITY; MECHANISMS; NUCLEATION; MORPHOLOGY	Li-O-2 batteries could potentially yield significantly higher capacities than Li-ion batteries. Achieving high capacity requires efficient void-filling of the cathode by the insoluble insulating discharge product Li2O2, which forms by two competing mechanistic pathways. One is a surface-mediated pathway that leads to formation of thin films of Li2O2 on the electrode. The other is a solvent-mediated pathway, involving the solvation of a Li+-O-2(-) intermediate that disproportionates and leads to the formation of large toroidal particles. As the solvent pathway produces large particles that are more efficient for void-filling than thin films produced by the surface pathway, there has been an active search for modifications that can promote the solvent pathway. We construct a model that demonstrates how discharge parameters influence each pathway and can be optimized to yield high capacity. We test the model with rotating ring-disk electrode experiments, which allow for the direct measurement of the relative contributions of solution and solvent pathways as a function of rotation rate, water content, voltage, and choice of solvent. We show that favorability of solvation of Li+-O-2(-) has a weak effect on the solvation rate and a large effect on the surface pathway rate. This insight can help guide strategies to optimize capacity in Li-O-2 batteries.

Cyclic voltammetry reveals reversible oxidations in the range of +0.70-1.10 V (vs. SCE). Computational, EPR, and X-ray analysis support the view that the oxidized species is best described as a cyclopropenium ion with spin density located on the heteroatom substituents, including 23.5 % on oxygen.

The combination of thermogravimetric analyses, X-ray thermodiffraction (XRD), and infrared spectroscopy has evidenced two unstable lacunar oxyfluorides that transform rapidly into hydroxyfluorides under ambient air. Their formulations and structural features have been determined from powder XRD, Mossbauer spectrometry, and pair distribution function, leading to Fe3+F2.5(OH)(0.)5 with the pyrochlore network and to Fe3+F2.66(OH)(0.34) with the hexagonal tungsten bronze (HTB) structure. The electrochemistry of these hydroxyfluorides indicates excellent and similar capacities with a significant decrease after the first cycle to reach sustained values of similar to 110 mAh g(-1) upon cycling. In situ XRD measurements reveal that the pyrochlore network undergoes amorphization (x(Li+) > 0.5) while the HTB phase transforms into the ReO3-type phase (x(Li+) > 0.33).

Direct high-resolution mapping of electrocatalytic activity of semi-two-dimensional catalysts with single-edge sensitivity	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						scanning electrochemistry; oxygen evolution reaction; electron tomography	SCANNING ELECTROCHEMICAL MICROSCOPY; H-2 EVOLUTION; NANOSHEETS; IDENTIFICATION; NANOPARTICLES	The catalytic activity of low-dimensional electrocatalysts is highly dependent on their local atomic structures, particularly those less-coordinated sites found at edges and corners; therefore, a direct probe of the electrocatalytic current at specified local sites with true nanoscopic resolution has become critically important. Despite the growing availability of operando imaging tools, to date it has not been possible to measure the electrocatalytic activities from individual material edges and directly correlate those with the local structural defects. Herein, we show the possibility of using feedback and generation/collection modes of operation of the scanning electro-chemical microscope (SECM) to independently image the topography and local electrocatalytic activity with 15-nm spatial resolution. We employed this operando microscopy technique to map out the oxygen evolution activity of a semi-2D nickel oxide nanosheet. The improved resolution and sensitivity enables us to distinguish the higher activities of the materials' edges from that of the fully coordinated surfaces in operando. The combination of spatially resolved electro-chemical information with state-of-the-art electron tomography, that unravels the 3D complexity of the edges, and ab initio calculations allows us to reveal the intricate coordination dependent activity along individual edges of the semi-2D material that is not achievable by other methods. The comparison of the simulated line scans to the experimental data suggests that the catalytic current density at the nanosheet edge is similar to 200 times higher than that at the NiO basal plane.

J	Dwyer, RP; Harrell, LE; Marohn, JA				Dwyer, Ryan P.; Harrell, Lee E.; Marohn, John A.			Lagrangian and Impedance-Spectroscopy Treatments of Electric Force Microscopy	PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED			English	Article							POLYMER/FULLERENE SOLAR-CELLS; QUANTUM DOTS; INSTANTANEOUS FREQUENCY; TIME RESOLUTION; NANOSCALE; CONTACT; DYNAMICS; POTENTIOMETRY; EQUATIONS; RESONANCE	Scanning probe microscopy is often extended beyond simple topographic imaging to study electrical forces and sample properties, with the most widely used experiment being frequency-modulated Kelvin probe force microscopy. The equations commonly used to interpret this frequency-modulated experiment, however, rely on two hidden assumptions. The first assumption is that the tip charge oscillates in phase with the cantilever motion to keep the tip voltage constant. The second assumption is that any changes in the tip-sample interaction happen slowly. Starting from an electromechanical model of the cantilever-sample interaction, we use Lagrangian mechanics to derive coupled equations of motion for the cantilever position and charge. We solve these equations analytically using perturbation theory, and, for verification, numerically. This general approach rigorously describes scanned probe experiments even in the case when the usual assumptions of fast tip charging and slowly changing samples properties are violated. We develop a Magnus-expansion approximation to illustrate how abrupt changes in the tip-sample interaction cause abrupt changes in the cantilever amplitude and phase. We show that feedback-free time-resolved electric force microscopy cannot uniquely determine subcycle photocapacitance dynamics. We then use first-order perturbation theory to relate cantilever frequency shift and dissipation to the sample impedance even when the tip charge oscillates out of phase with the cantilever motion. Analogous to the treatment of impedance spectroscopy in electrochemistry, we apply this approximation to determine the cantilever frequency shift and dissipation for an arbitrary sample impedance in both local dielectric spectroscopy and broadband local dielectric spectroscopy experiments. The general approaches that we develop provide a path forward for rigorously modeling the coupled motion of the cantilever position and charge in the wide range of electrical scanned probe microscopy experiments where the hidden assumptions of the conventional equations are violated or inapplicable.

Multiple redox processes were observed in the ILs. During the anodic oxidation processes, the NTf2- anion is oxidized to form NTf2 center dot radical and CO is oxidized to CO2 and produces a proton in these ILs when a trace amount of water is present. The products of oxidation processes (NTf2 center dot radical and proton) can be reduced at cathodic processes. Results show that the cation in these ILs can facilitate the formation of an electrolyte-electrode interface structure that influences the amount of CO adsorbed as well as the subsequent CO oxidation current and charge. By selecting the anodic and cathodic potentials, we developed an innovative electroanalytical method for CO sensing based on a simple double-potential adsorptive stripping chronoamperometry. The method allows calibration of the concurrent NTf2- anion and CO redox processes as well as the double-layer charging and discharging processes in the IL with the presence of a trace amount of water providing quantitative analysis of CO concentration with high accuracy and sensitivity. The reported method is the first work to show that quantitative CO detection can be achieved in the presence of complex dynamic interfacial processes in the ILs. The trace water present in the ILs is beneficial for CO oxidation, but a large amount of water is detrimental for the CO oxidation in ambient condition.

The surface-treatment agents used for the functionalization of Fe3O4 anode materials were systematically varied to include aromatic or aliphatic structures: 4-mercaptobenzoic acid, benzoic acid (BA), 3-mercaptopropionic acid, and propionic acid (PA). Both structural and electrochemical characterizations have been used to systematically correlate the electrode functionality with the corresponding surface chemistry. Surface treatment with ligands led to better Fe3O4 dispersion, especially with the aromatic ligands. Electrochemistry was impacted where the PA- and BA-treated Fe3O4 systems without the -SH group demonstrated a higher rate capability than their thiol-containing counterparts and the pristine Fe3O4. Specifically, the PA system delivered the highest capacity and cycling stability among all samples tested. Notably, the aromatic BA system outperformed the aliphatic PA counterpart during extended cycling under high current density, due to the improved charge transfer and ion transport kinetics as well as better dispersion of Fe3O4 NPs, induced by the conjugated system. Our surface engineering of the Fe3O4 electrode presented herein, highlights the importance of modifying the structure and chemistry of surface-treatment agents as a plausible means of enhancing the interfacial charge transfer within metal oxide composite electrodes without hampering the resulting tap density of the resulting electrode.

The use of an asymmetric nanoelectrochemical environment at the nanopore orifice, for example, an acid inside the pipette and halide ions in the bulk, enabled us to observe unusually large current blockages of single Ag nanoparticles. We attribute these current blockages to the formation of H-2 nanobubbles on the surface of Ag nanoparticles due to the coupled faradaic reactions, in which the reduction of protons and water is coupled to the oxidation of Ag and water under potentials higher than 1 V. The appearance of large current blockages was strongly dependent on the applied voltage and the choice of anions in the bulk solution. The correlation between large current blockages with the oxidation of Ag nanoparticles and their nanopore translocation was further supported by simultaneous fluorescence and electric recordings. This study demonstrates that transient bipolar electrochemistry can take place on small metal nanoparticles below 50 nm when they pass through nanopores where the electric field is highly localized. The use of a nanopore and the resistive-pulse sensing method to study transient bipolar electrochemistry of nanoparticles may be extended to future studies in ultrafast electrochemistry, nanocatalyst screening, and gas nucleation on nanoparticles.

Here we report the design and demonstration of a remediation method based on a concept of asymmetrical alternating current electrochemistry that achieves high degrees of contaminant removal for different heavy metals (copper, lead, cadmium) at different initial concentrations (from 100 to 10,000 ppm), all reaching corresponding regulation levels for residential scenario after rational treatment time (from 30 min to 6 h). No excessive nutrient loss in treated soil is observed and no secondary toxic product is produced. Long-term experiment and plant assay show the high sustainability of the method and its feasibility for agricultural use.

The reactions that follow the initial electron transfer step and yield the products are intimately coupled with reactant transport. Depiction of the ensuing reactions profiles is the key to the mechanism and selectivity parameters. Analysis is eased by the steady state resulting from coupling of diffusion with convection forced by solution stirring or circulation. Homogeneous molecular catalysis of organic electrochemical reactions of the redox or chemical type may be treated in the same manner. The same benchmarking procedures recently developed for the activation of small molecules in the context of modern energy challenges lead to the establishment and comparison of the catalytic Tafel plots. At the very opposite, redox-neutral chemical reactions may be catalyzed by injection (or removal) of an electron from the electrode. This class of reactions has currently few, but very thoroughly analyzed, examples. It is likely that new cases will emerge in the near future.

LIBs are dominant in consumer electronics, and they have also entered the market of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in HEVs, and pure EVs. However, state-of-the-art LIBs are electrochemically intercalation-based and are still limited in energy density and power rates. To address these challenges and others (e. g. safety issues and cost), conversion-based copper sulfides (CuxS, 1 <= x <= 2) have been investigated as alternative cathodes for improved electrochemical performance, that is, higher energy density, better cycling stability, and enhanced rate capability. In this work, we summarize the recent research progress on CuxS to gain a better understanding of the material's electrochemical mechanisms and develop feasible strategies for improving its performance.

Information on the meso- to nanostructures of the resulting catalytic films forms the basis of the understanding of new modes of transport of the reactants (catalysts, substrates and cosubstrates, products) that may govern the mechanistic competitions and consequently selectivity. Efforts to adapt benchmarking procedures developed in homogeneous molecular catalysis (catalytic Tafel plots) should be encouraged, taking into account, as additional factors, the transport of electrons and reacting species (including gases) through the catalytic system.

In this mechanistic study of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyzed by cobalt-intercalated layered MnO2, we show that confinement effects and local cobalt atomic ordering in the interlayer space can be synergistically used to tune the adsorption energies of O, OH, and OOH reaction intermediates and the scaling relationship between them. In general, the interlayer confinement destabilizes the adsorption of intermediates for the OER, but clustering Co atoms can selectively stabilize the adsorption of OOH in particular. After considering both effects, our model predicts an overpotential of 0.30 V for the Co-intercalated MnO2 catalyzed OER, in excellent agreement with the experimental result of 0.36 V. These new insights explain the enhanced catalytic performance of MnO2 by intercalating atoms and illuminate a route for engineering non-toxic precious-metal-free catalysts through designed layered materials.

The cathode films were post-annealed at 500, 600 and 700 degrees C to study (i) the impact of annealing temperature on the crystallization of the cathode film and (ii) the reactivity between the cathode film and the stainless steel substrate. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were adopted to characterize the thin films. The electrochemical properties of the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathodes were investigated with cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge tests. As the annealing temperature increased from 500 to 600 degrees C, the crystallinity and electrochemical characteristics of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 both improved. However, as the annealing temperature further increased to 700 degrees C, the phase purity and the electrochemical performance were greatly deteriorated. Combined chemical analyses with time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry depth profiling and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy in scanning transmission electron microscopy mapping have indicated that the cross-diffusion of metal ions between LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 and the stainless steel substrate takes place at a temperature higher than 600 degrees C, which was attributed as a main origin of the phase change in the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode layer and electrochemistry degradations of lithium-ion battery.

J	Edwards, MA; White, HS; Ren, H				Edwards, Martin A.; White, Henry S.; Ren, Hang			Voltammetric Determination of the Stochastic Formation Rate and Geometry of Individual H-2, N-2, and O-2 Bubble Nuclei	ACS NANO			English	Article						single-entity electrochemistry; nucleation; survival analysis; nanoelectrode; activation energy; contact angle	SURFACE-TENSION; NUCLEATION; NANOBUBBLES; GROWTH; HYDROGEN	Herein, we report a general voltammetric method to characterize the electrochemical nucleation rate and nuclei of single nanobubbles. Bubble nucleation is indicated by a sharp peak in the current in the voltammetry of gas-evolving reactions. In contrast to expectations based on the stochastic nature of nucleation events, the peak current signifying a stable nucleus is extremely reproducible over hundreds of cycles (similar to 3% deviation). By applying classical nucleation theory, this seemingly deterministic behavior can be not only understood but also used to quantify the nucleation rate and size of bubble nuclei. A statistical model is developed whereby properties of single critical nuclei (contact angle, the radius of curvature, activation energy, and Arrhenius pre-exponential factor) can be readily measured from the narrow distribution of peak currents (mean, standard deviation) from hundreds of voltammetric cycles at a nanoelectrode. Single nanobubbles formed from gas-evolving reactions (H-2 from H+ reduction, N-2 from N2H4 oxidation, O-2 from H2O2 oxidation) are analyzed to find that their critical nuclei have contact angles of similar to 150, similar to 160, and similar to 154 degrees for H-2,H- N-2, and O-2, respectively, corresponding to similar to 50, similar to 40, and similar to 90 gas molecules in each nucleus. The energy barriers for heterogeneous nucleation of H-2, N-2, and O-2 bubbles are, respectively, 2, 0.4, and 0.7% of those required for homogeneous nucleation under the same supersaturation.

Current methods for heavy-metal treatment in both sources have limitations. For point-of-use water, current methods usually suffer from limited capacity and difficulties in spontaneously removing multiple heavy metals. For industrial wastewater, current methods greatly reduce the value of heavy metal by precipitating them as sludge which requires further treatment. Here we developed an electrochemical method that can treat both low-concentration and high-concentration heavy-metal pollution using either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC) electrodeposition with graphene-oxide-modified carbon felt electrode (CF-GO). The graphene oxide provides a high density of surface functional groups to assist the electrodeposition. The electrodeposition method showed 2 orders of magnitude higher capacity (>29 g heavy metal for 1 g of graphene oxide) compared with traditional adsorption methods. For low levels of heavy-metal pollution in point-of-use water, DC electrodeposition with a CF-GO electrode can reduce single heavy-metal ion pollution (Cu, Cd, and Pb) as well as multiple ion mixtures to below safe water drinking levels. This method can tolerate a much wider range of heavy-metal pollution in point-of-use water than traditional adsorption methods. For high-level pollution in industrial wastewater, AC electrodeposition can recover >99.9% heavy-metal ions. By tuning the AC frequency and voltage, the electrodeposition method can further selectively recover Cu, Cd, and Pb separately, which adds values to the heavy-metal removal process.

Metal Nanowire Felt as a Flow-Through Electrode for High-Productivity Electrochemistry	ACS NANO			English	Article						flow electrochemistry; copper nanowires; three-dimensional electrode; flow-through electrode; electroorganic synthesis	RETICULATED VITREOUS CARBON; BY POROUS-ELECTRODES; MASS-TRANSFER; GRAPHITE FELT; NICKEL FOAM; BATTERIES; PERFORMANCE; FUEL; ELECTROSYNTHESIS; PERMEABILITY	Flow-through electrodes such as carbon paper are used in redox flow batteries, water purification, and electroorganic syntheses. This work examines the extent to which reducing the size of the fibers to the nanoscale in a flow-through electrode can increase the productivity of electrochemical processes. A Cu nanowire felt, made from nanowires 45 times smaller than the 10 mu m wide fibers in carbon paper, can achieve a productivity 278 times higher than carbon paper for mass-transport-limited reduction of Cu ions. Higher increases in productivity were predicted for the Cu nanowire felt based on the mass transport-limited current, but Cu ion reduction became charge transfer-limited on Cu nanowire felt at high concentrations and flow rates when the mass-transport-limited current became comparable to the charge transfer-limited current. In comparison, the reaction rate on carbon paper was mass-transport-limited under all concentrations and flow rates because its mass-transport-limited current was much lower than its charge transfer-limited current. Higher volumetric productivities were obtained for the Cu nanowire felt by switching from Cu ion reduction to Alizarin Red S (ARS) reduction, which has a higher reaction rate constant. An electroorganic intramolecular cyclization reaction with Cu nanowire felt achieved a productivity 4.2 times higher than that of carbon paper, although this reaction was also affected by charge transfer kinetics. This work demonstrates that large gains in productivity can be achieved with nanostructured flow-through electrodes, but the potential gains can be limited by the charge transfer kinetics of a reaction.

However, the electrochemical performance of silicon anodes in ether-based electrolytes, which is essential for better understanding the electrochemistry of sulfur/silicon full cells, has not been fully investigated. In this work, the effect of ether-based electrolytes on the cycling performance and surface chemistry of silicon electrodes containing microsized particles was systematically studied. In LiNO3-containing ether-based electrolyte, silicon electrode showed the fastest capacity fading and the shortest cycle life. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were employed to examine the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) properties of silicon microparticles. An unfavorable SEI is responsible for poor cycling performance in ether-based electrolytes. Our results shed new light on the reason for short cycle life of most of the reported sulfur/silicon full cells.

Twenty-five preservice chemistry teachers first viewed a video of a redox reaction happening between a zinc wire and a copper(II) sulfate solution, then they reflected on their macroscopic observations, and generated storyboards (a sequence of drawings) representing this reaction at the submicroscopic level. Both the reflections and the storyboards were coded, and the categories reflecting the participants' levels of understanding were determined. Results showed that the participants usually identified the macroscopic evidences, but they had conceptual difficulties in interpreting and representing evidences at the submicroscopic level. Few participants indicated a scientific or a moderate understanding of redox reactions, whereas the majority exhibited either weak or alternative understanding of redox reactions.

Here, we use in situ X-ray computed tomography to reveal the evolution of mechanical damage within a Li1+xAlxGe2-x(PO4)(3) (LAGP) SSE caused by interphase growth during electrochemical cycling. The growth of an interphase with expanded volume drives fracture in this material, and the extent of fracture during cycling is found to be the primary factor causing the impedance increase, as opposed to the resistance of the interphase itself. Cracks are observed to initiate near the edge of the lithium/LAGP interface, which agrees with simulations. The chemomechanical effects of interphase growth studied here are expected to play a role in a variety of SSE materials, and this work is a step toward designing durable interfaces.

In-plane Bragg peaks are observed by grazing incidence diffraction. Focusing the incident beam down to an area of about 10 mu m X 10 mu m, individual flakes are probed by specular X-ray reflectivity. By deploying a recursive Parratt algorithm to model the experimental data, we gain access to characteristic crystallographic parameters of the samples. Notably, it is possible to directly extract the bi/multilayer graphene c-axis lattice parameter. The latter is found to increase upon lithiation, which we control using an on-chip peripheral electrochemical cell layout. These experiments demonstrate the feasibility of in situ X-ray diffraction on individual, micron-sized single crystallites of few- and bilayer two-dimensional materials.

Here, we have combined ultrahigh vacuum surface science techniques, electrochemical measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) to quantify structure-dependent OER activity in a series of well-defined electrocatalysts. We describe a direct correlation between the population of Fe edge-site atoms and the OER activity of ultrathin Fe2O3 nanostructures (similar to 0.5 nm apparent height) grown on Au(111) substrates. Hydroxylated Fe atoms residing at edge-sites along the catalyst/support interface were spectroscopically identified as key reaction centers, and these Fe edge-site atoms were estimated to produce OER turnover frequencies approximately 150 times higher than that of Fe atoms on the catalyst surface at an applied potential of 1.8 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode. Impressively, ultrathin Fe2O3/Au nanostructures with a high density of catalytically active Fe edge-site atoms outperformed an ultrathin IrOx/Au catalyst at moderate overpotentials. DFT calculations revealed more favorable OER at edge sites along the Fe2O3/Au interface, with lower predicted overpotentials due to beneficial modification of intermediate binding. Our results demonstrate how a combination of surface science, electrochemistry, and computational modeling can be used to identify key structure-property relationships in a well-defined electrocatalytic system.

Phthalocyanines as a pi-pi Adsorption Strategy to Immobilize Catalyst on Carbon for Electrochemical Synthesis	SYNLETT			English	Article						electrochemistry; phthalocyanines; alcohol oxidation; electrosynthesis; pyrene	CASCADE REACTIONS; OXIDATION; REDUCTION; ALCOHOLS; PYRENE; TEMPO; ELECTRODES; GRAPHITE; CO2	In most electrochemical syntheses, reactions are happening at or near the electrode surface. For catalyzed reactions, ideally, the electrode surface would solely contain the catalyst, which then simplifies purification and lowers the amount of catalyst needed. Here, a new strategy involving phthalocyanines (Pc) to immobilize catalysts onto carbon electrode surfaces is presented. The large structure of the Pc enables adsorption to the sp (2) -structure of graphitic carbon. TEMPO-modified Pc were chosen as a proof of concept to test the new immobilization strategy. It was found that the TEMPO-Pc derivatives functioned similarly or better than the widely used pyrene adsorption method. Interestingly, the new TEMPO-Pc catalyst appears to facilitate a cascade reaction involving both the anode and the cathode. The first step is the generation of an aryl aldehyde (anode) followed by the reduction of the aryl aldehyde in a pinacol-type coupling reaction at the cathode. The last step is the oxidation of a hydrobenzoin to create benzil. This work demonstrates the unique ability of electrochemistry and bifunctional catalysts to enable multistep chemical transformations, performing both reductive and oxidative transformations in one pot.

The visible spectra of Fe(OEPone)(NO) were similar in both solvents. Unlike other ferrous porphyrin nitrosyls, a six-coordinate complex was formed with THF as a ligand. This led to two nitrosyl bands in the infrared spectrum. The absorbance of these bands depended on the concentration of THF in the solution. Solvation and coordination effects on the carbonyl and nitrosyl bands were observed for both the nitrosyl and reduced-nitrosyl complexes. DFT calculations were carried out to interpret the spectral changes.

Our results reveal that Mg atoms can be stripped from metallic Mg and from Mg2Sn through galvanic replacement reactions involving anions present in APC such as Ph4Al-, Ph2AlCl2-, PhAlCl3- and AlCl4-, resulting in Mg dissolution and metallic aluminum deposition. Such a spontaneous degradation phenomenon is susceptible to impact the performance of Mg-ion battery cells in which metallic Mg or magnesium alloys are used as anodes. In particular, we have found that Mg-ion battery half-cells assembled using Mg2Sn and metallic Mg as the working and counter electrodes, respectively, and APC as the electrolyte, exhibit Coulombic efficiencies higher than 100% at low C-rates. Such an unusual Coulombic efficiency is attributed to unbalance charge associated with the difference in Mg atoms dissolution rate between the Mg2Sn working electrode and the Mg metal counter electrode, when these electrodes undergo spontaneous degradation in APC.

The impact of alkyl tri-methyl ammonium side chains on perfluorinated ionic membranes for electrochemical applications	JOURNAL OF POLYMER SCIENCE PART B-POLYMER PHYSICS			English	Article						anion exchange membranes; electrochemical applications; electrochemistry; fuel cells; perfluorinated AEMs; polyelectrolytes; polytetrafluoroethylene	ANION-EXCHANGE MEMBRANES; FUEL-CELLS; WATER; PRECURSOR; NAFION; STATE; HYDROXIDE; INTERPLAY	Three different perfluorinated type polymers as anion exchange membranes for electrochemical applications were studied. They have a sulfonamide linkage to a spacer methylene chain attached to a tri-methyl ammonium cation, specifically using a three carbon spacer chain (PFAEM_H_C3), and methylated imide polymers with three (PFAEM_CH3_C3) and six carbon spacer chain (PFAEM_CH3_C6). There are significant number of zwitterionic side chains in the PFAEM_H_C3 polymer and very few in the PFAEM_CH3_C3 or the PFAEM_CH3_C6 polymer. They have similar halide conductivity, but the PFAEM_CH3_C6 showed highest OH- conductivity, 122 mS cm(-1) at 80 degrees C and 95% RH. The larger spacer chain polymer, PFAEM_CH3_C6 has a higher water uptake value (lambda = 9) compared to PFAEM_CH3_C3(lambda = 7) at 60 degrees C and 95% RH in the Cl- form. Therefore, it has a larger domain spacing of 4.9 nm versus 4.1 nm from small angle X-ray scattering data. The polymer was characterized by FTIR and DFT was used to fully assign the spectra.

Our previous concept of a galvanic cell with a galvanic short circuit (GSC) in a thin-layer arrangement disproved this expectation. Here, the system with GSC was studied in depth, described and an empiric model was derived and confirmed experimentally. The crucial influence of the solution and the charge transfer resistances on the output performance of the cell were observed. A set of galvanic cells was prepared using screen-printing. The panel of galvanic cells was designed and prepared in a way which enabled simple modular combination of more than one GSC. Thus, multiples of the voltage of the initial single cell can be obtained, while using only scissors for cutting the desired shape of the cell. The output characteristics under load were determined in a bulk measurement. Although, the enhancement of the output voltage in such experimental setup was not as pronounced as in a thin layer, the cell with GSC performed better in comparison with a single galvanic cell.

A facile single-step processing technique was used to develop bimodal grain structure in stainless steel. The bimodal steel was tested in cavitation erosion and erosion-corrosion conditions. In both the cases, bimodal steel showed exceptionally high degradation resistance, nearly 7 times higher compared to as-received steel. The remarkable cavitation erosion resistance demonstrated by bimodal steel is attributed to its high yield strength along with high work-hardening rate. In addition, the bimodal steel showed significantly low corrosion rate of 0.001 mm/year in 3.5 wt % NaCl solution compared to 0.088 mm/year for as-received stainless steel.

Oxidant aggregate-induced porosity in vapour-deposited polymer films and correlated impact on electrochemical properties	SUPRAMOLECULAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Conducting polymer; reactive vapor deposition; electrochemistry; porosity; aggregate	POLY(3,4-ETHYLENEDIOXYTHIOPHENE); ENERGY	Persistently doped conjugated polymers are integral for energy storage, flexible electronics, and biosensors due to their unique ability to interact with both ionic and electronic currents. To maximise the performance of devices across these fields, research has focused on controlling material properties to optimise conductivities of both types of charge carriers. The challenge lies in improving ionic transport, which is typically the rate-limiting step in redox processes, without sacrificing electronic conductivity or desirable mechanical properties. Here we report on control of nanostructure in vapour deposited conducting polymer films and correlate changes in film structure with resulting electrochemical properties. Structural control is enabled by exploiting the growth of oxidant nanoaggregates during the reactive vapour deposition process. Relative to dense films, porous films exhibit faster response times in electrochemical testing. Scan rate analysis confirms a transition away from diffusion-limited charging kinetics and demonstrates the important role that porosity can play in ion transport through electroactive polymers. Advantageously, continuous polymer networks remain evident in nanostructured films, ensuring that high electronic conductivities are maintained along with high porosity. We find that such enhanced properties are retained even as polymer thickness increases ten-fold. The films reported herein may serve as robust electrodes in flexible electrochemical devices.

J.; Erbe, Andreas			Alkaline manganese electrochemistry studied by in situ and operando spectroscopic methods - metal dissolution, oxide formation and oxygen evolution	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							WATER OXIDATION; ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY; ELECTRON-TRANSFER; FILMS; ZINC; TEMPERATURE; BIRNESSITE; CATALYST	Manganese-based systems are considered as candidate electrocatalysts for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER), because of their abundance in biochemical oxygen producing catalyst systems. In this work, the surface of metallic manganese was investigated in situ and operando in potentiodynamic cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments and potentiostatic chronoamperometry (CA) experiments in NaOH. In both cases, the surfaces were initially reduced. At corresponding potentials, no oxide species can be detected by Raman spectroscopy, though electrochemical data and the absence of dissolution above the reversible potential for reactions of type Mn -> Mn-II indicate that the material is passive. The CV shows anodic peaks at potentials in line with expectations on the basis of thermodynamic data for the oxidation to Mn3O4 and Mn2O3; the thickness of the surface layer increases by a few nm during these peaks, as evidenced by spectroscopic ellipsometry. Dissolution of Mn as evidenced by downstream electrolyte analysis by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry in a scanning flow cell (SFC-ICP-MS) of the electrolyte is negligible in the range of electrode potential vs. Ag|AgCl|3 M KCl, E-Ag|AgCl, up to 0.3 V. Remarkably, Raman spectra already show the occurrence of alpha-MnO2 at E-Ag|AgCl > -0.25 V, which is ca. 0.5 V below the potential at which oxidation to MnO2 is expected. This observation is attributed to disproportionation above a certain level of Mn-III. For E-Ag|AgCl > 0.4 V, dissolution sets in, at a constant layer thickness. Above the onset potential of the OER, at E-Ag|AgCl approximate to 0.6 V, SFC-ICP-MS analysis shows fast dissolution, and the oxide layer thickness is constant or increases. CA experiments during the OER show strong dissolution, and the re-formation of a strongly disordered, beta-MnO2-like oxide, which exists in a quasi-stationary state at the interface. Several CV cycles increase the dissolution per cycle and the fraction of alpha-MnO2 on the surface which cannot be reduced. The high dissolution currents show that metallic Mn is hardly suitable as an OER catalyst, however, at least the Mn-IV oxides remain stationarily present in the system.

They were subjected to photophysical, electrochemical and theoretical studies. The dyes exhibited characteristic lambda(abs) and lambda(emi) in the range of 445-485 and 545-570 nm, respectively. Both optical and electrochemical band gaps were found to be in the range of 2.2 to 2.35 eV. The driving forces for injection (Delta G(inj)), recombination (Delta G(rec)) and regeneration (Delta G(reg)) processes were evaluated to understand their feasibility. Finally, the DSSC devices were fabricated employing the new dyes as sensitizers as well as co-sensitizers along with the Ru(ii) based N3 dye. Interestingly, DTP carrying 4-aminobenzoic acid as the anchoring group shows the best photoelectrochemical performance, viz. photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) = 4.4%, open circuit potential (V-OC) = 0.577 V, and short-circuit current density (J(SC)) = 9.06 mA cm(-2) with a broad incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum. Co-sensitization of the dyes brought about enhanced V-OC values, compared to the N3 dye alone. Finally, different interface resistance values obtained from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) circuit fitting were used to study the fundamental processes of energy conversion.

J	Varshavsky, A				Varshavsky, Alexander			On the cause of sleep: Protein fragments, the concept of sentinels, and links to epilepsy	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						fragment; extracellular; intracellular; proteolysis; sleep	END RULE PATHWAY; CALPAIN-MEDIATED CLEAVAGE; SUPRAMOLECULAR ORGANIZATION; INHIBITORY SYNAPSES; RELEASE CHANNEL; NMDA RECEPTORS; CALCINEURIN; ACTIVATION; PLASTICITY; UBIQUITIN	The molecular-level cause of sleep is unknown. In 2012, we suggested that the cause of sleep stems from cumulative effects of numerous intracellular and extracellular protein fragments. According to the fragment generation (FG) hypothesis, protein fragments (which are continually produced through nonprocessive cleavages by intracellular, intramembrane, and extracellular proteases) can be beneficial but toxic as well, and some fragments are eliminated slowly during wakefulness. We consider the FG hypothesis and propose that, during wakefulness, the degradation of accumulating fragments is delayed within natural protein aggregates such as postsynaptic densities (PSDs) in excitatory synapses and in other dense protein meshworks, owing to an impeded diffusion of the similar to 3,000-kDa 265 proteasome. We also propose that a major function of sleep involves a partial and reversible expansion of PSDs, allowing an accelerated destruction of PSD-localized fragments by the ubiquitin/proteasome system. Expansion of PSDs would alter electrochemistry of synapses, thereby contributing to a decreased neuronal firing during sleep. If so, the loss of consciousness, a feature of sleep, would be the consequence of molecular processes (expansions of protein meshworks) that are required for degradation of protein fragments. We consider the concept of FG sentinels, which signal to sleep-regulating circuits that the levels of fragments are going up. Also discussed is the possibility that protein fragments, which are known to be overproduced during an epileptic seizure, may contribute to postictal sleep and termination of seizures. These and related suggestions, described in the paper, are compatible with current evidence about sleep and lead to testable predictions.

Electrochemistry shows a change in the reduction potential with addition of acid. However, photochemistry is invariant to the absence or presence of acid. The anthracene and phenol/ 4- methoxyphenyl moieties of the azo dyes are highly conjugated, likely mitigating photo- induced charge transfer, despite sufficient driving force.

The ET rate can be enhanced by decreasing the number of chlorine substituents in the AQ molecules because that increases the driving force, which is the energy level offset between the conduction band energy of CdSe/ZnS and the lowest upper molecular orbital potential of AQ derivatives, as confirmed by cyclic voltammetry measurements. However, the electronic coupling between the QDs and AQ derivatives, and the sum of reorganization energy of AQ molecules and solvent calculated by density functional theory are not the main reasons for the change in ET rate in three systems. Our findings provide new insights into selecting an acceptor molecule and will be useful in tuning ET processes for advanced QD-based applications.

J	Jackson, MN; Pegis, ML; Surendranath, Y				Jackson, Megan N.; Pegis, Michael L.; Surendranath, Yogesh			Graphite-Conjugated Acids Reveal a Molecular Framework for Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer at Electrode Surfaces	ACS CENTRAL SCIENCE			English	Article							ELECTROCATALYTIC OXYGEN REDUCTION; CO2 REDUCTION; CARBON-MONOXIDE; FUEL; ELECTROREDUCTION; SPECTROSCOPY; VOLTAMMETRY; DERIVATIVES; CATALYSTS; KINETICS	Proton-coupled electron-transfer (PCET) steps play a key role in energy conversion reactions. Molecular PCET reactions are well-described by "square schemes" in which the overall thermochemistry of the reaction is broken into its constituent proton-transfer and electron-transfer components. Although this description has been essential for understanding molecular PCET, no such framework exists for PCET reactions that take place at electrode surfaces. Herein, we develop a molecular square scheme framework for interfacial PCET by investigating the electrochemistry of molecularly well-defined acid/base sites conjugated to graphitic electrodes. Using cyclic voltammetry, we first demonstrate that, irrespective of the redox properties of the corresponding molecular analogue, proton transfer to graphite-conjugated acid/base sites is coupled to electron transfer. We then show that the thermochemistry of surface PCET events can be described by the pK(a) of the molecular analogue and the potential of zero free charge (zero-field reduction potential) of the electrode. This work provides a general framework for analyzing and predicting the thermochemistry of interfacial PCET reactions.

The redox properties and electronic structures of all new compounds were investigated using cyclic voltammetry and density functional theory (DFT). The observed electrochemistry and UV-visible transitions are in good agreement with the DFT and time-dependent DFT calculations, which indicate that the HOMO is largely centered at the O=C-C-C=O fragments, and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital is more extended onto the isoindoline unit.

Experiments were conducted in selected acidic and alkaline chloride-containing environments using simultaneous AC and DC electrochemistry; including on-line Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). In parallel experiments, in-situ neutron reflectometry (NR) and ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were utilized to characterize the formation of surface oxide films as a function of time. The specific roles of pH and Mo during passivation and breakdown kinetics are highlighted, providing an insight into the fate of the elements which comprise the alloys, and their effects on passivation behavior. It was observed that early oxidation of both Ni and Cr-species occurred in acidic electrolyte. Preferential dissolution of Ni2+ at later times enabled gradual Cr3+ enrichment within the surface film. However, greater relative stability of NiO and Ni(OH)(2) was observed in the alkaline condition. Upon alloying Ni-Cr with Mo, Cr3+ became increasingly enriched in the surface film during anodic polarization. Oxides were interpreted to consist of non-stoichiometric solid solutions formed via solute capture. (C) The Author(s) 2019. Published by ECS.

Janus electrochemistry: Simultaneous electrochemical detection at multiple working conditions in a paper-based analytical device	ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Microfluidic paper-based analytical device; Electrochemistry; Janus; Paper-based analytical device	COLORIMETRIC DETECTION; PASTE ELECTRODES; SENSOR; BACTERIA; PLATFORM; CD(II); DESIGN; ZN(II); FOOD	The simultaneous detection of multiple analytes from a single sample is a critical tool for the analysis of real world samples. However, this is challenging to accomplish in the field by current electroanalytical techniques, where tuning assay conditions towards a target analyte often results in poor selectivity and sensitivity for other species in the mixture. In this work, an electrochemical paper-based analytical device (ePAD) capable of performing simultaneous electrochemical experiments in different solution conditions on a single sample was developed for the first time. We refer to the system as a Janus-ePAD after the two-faced Greek god because of the ability of the device to perform electrochemistry on the same sample under differing solution conditions at the same time with a single potentiostat. In a JanusePAD, a sample wicks down two channels from a single inlet towards two discreet reagent zones that adjust solution conditions, such as pH, before flow termination in two electrochemical detection zones. These zones feature independent working electrodes and shared reference and counter electrodes, facilitating simultaneous detection of multiple species at each species' optimal solution condition. The device utility and applicability are demonstrated through the simultaneous detection of two biologically relevant species (norepinephrine and serotonin) and a common enzymatic assay product (p-amino-phenol) at two different solution pH conditions. Janus-ePADs show great promise as an inexpensive and broadly applicable platform which can reduce the complexity and/or number of steps required in multiplexed analysis, while also operating under the optimized conditions of each species present in a mixture.

The triphos ligand bridges the diiron vector whilst also chelating to one iron and 1-3 exist as a mixture of basal-basal-apical (bba) and basal-basal-basal (bbb) isomers which differ in the mode of chelation. In solution the bba and bbb forms do not interconvert on the NMR time scale, but the bba isomers are fluxional, and at low temperature four forms of 1bba are seen as the conformations for the pdt ring and triphos methylene groups are frozen. Crystallographic studies have established bba (pdt) and bbb (adt) ground state conformations and in both there is a significant deviation away from the expected eclipsed conformation (L-ap-Fe-Fe-L-ap torsion angle 0 degrees) by 49.4 and 24.9 degrees respectively, suggesting that introduction of triphos leads to significant strain and DFT calculations have been used to understand the relative energies of isomers. The electron rich nature of the diiron centre in 1-4 would suggest rapid protonation, but while bridging hydride complexes such as [Fe-2(CO)(3)(-pdt)(,(1),(2)-triphos)(-H)][BF4] (1H(+)) can be formed the process is slow. This behavior is likely a result of the high energy barrier in forming the initial (not observed) terminal hydride which requires a significant conformational change in triphos coordination. CV studies show that all starting compounds oxidize at low potentials and the addition of [Cp2Fe][PF6] to 1 affords [Fe-2(CO)(3)(-pdt)(,(1),(2)-triphos)][PF6] (1(+)) which has been characterised by IR spectroscopy. DFT studies suggest a ground state for 1(+) with a partially rotated Fe(CO)(2)P moiety that yields a weak semi-bridging carbonyl with the adjacent Fe(CO)P-2 group. No reduction peaks are seen for 1-4 within the solvent window but 1H(+) undergoes reduction at -1.7 V. All complexes act as proton-reduction catalysts in the presence of HBF4Et2O. For 1, three separate processes are observed and their dependence on acid concentration has been probed, and a mechanistic scheme is proposed based on formation via a CECE process of 1(-H)H which can either slowly release H-2 or undergo further reduction. Relative contributions of the three processes to the total current were found to be highly dependent upon the background electrolyte, being attributed to their relative abilities to facilitate proton transfer processes. While 2 and 4 show similar proton reduction behaviour, the adt complex 3 is quite different being attributed to facile protonation of nitrogen which is followed by addition of a second proton at the diiron centre.

In this work, we utilize proton- coupled electron transfer to outcompete the undesired dimerization and achieve successful hydride regenerations of two groups of organic hydrides - acridines and benzimidazoles.

Exploring the Kinetic and Thermodynamic Relationship of Charge Transfer Reactions Used in Localized Electrodeposition and Patterning in a Scanning Bipolar Cell	FRONTIERS IN CHEMISTRY			English	Article						bipolar electrochemistry; electrodeposition; material fabrication; current distribution; electrolyte design	METAL-DEPOSITION; NICKEL; ACID; COEFFICIENTS; PASSIVATION; DISSOLUTION; PARTICLES; GRADIENTS; PLATFORM	Bipolar electrochemistry involves spatial separation of charge balanced reduction and oxidation reactions on an electrically floating electrode, a result of intricate coupling of the work piece with the ohmic drop in the electrochemical cell and to the thermodynamics and kinetics of the respective bipolar reactions. When paired with a rastering microjet electrode, in a scanning bipolar cell (SBC), local electrodeposition and patterning of metals beneath the microjet can be realized without direct electrical connections to the workpiece. Here, we expand on prior research detailing electrolyte design guidelines for electrodeposition and patterning with the SBC, focusing on the relationship between kinetics and thermodynamics of the respective bipolar reactions. The kinetic reversibility or irreversibility of the desired deposition reaction influences the range of possible effective bipolar counter reactions. For kinetically irreversible deposition systems (i.e., nickel), a wider thermodynamic window is available for selection of the counter reaction. For kinetically reversible systems (i.e., copper or silver) that can be easily etched, tight thermodynamic windows with a small downhill driving force for spontaneous reduction are required to prevent metal patterns from electrochemical dissolution. Furthermore, additives used for the bipolar counter reaction can influence not only the kinetics of deposition, but also the morphology and microstructure of the deposit. Cyclic voltammetry measurements help elucidate secondary parasitic reduction reactions occurring during bipolar nickel deposition and describe the thermodynamic relationship of both irreversible and reversible bipolar couples. Finally, finite element method simulations explore the influence of bipolar electrode area on current efficiency and connect experimental observations of pattern etching to thermodynamic and kinetic relationships.

We have fabricated nanoengineered red blood cells (NERBCs) by an environmentally friendly method by using red blood cells as the raw material and hemoglobin (Hb) embedded with ultrasmall hydroxyapatite (HAP, Ca-10(PO4)(6)(OH)(2)) as the functional BFC cathode material. The NERBCs showed greatly enhanced cell performance with high electrocatalytic activity, stability, and selectivity. The NERBCs maintained the original biological properties of the natural cell, while enhancing the catalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) through the interaction between -OH groups in HAP and the Hb in RBCs. They also enabled direct electron transportation, eliminating the need for an electron-transfer mediator, and showed catalytic inactivity for glucose oxidation, thus potentially enabling the development of separator-free BFCs.

While significant advances have been made, several gaps still exist in our understanding of this issue, namely, the relative differences in the electrochemical activity of the perfect basal plane and perfect edge plane and the dependence of measurable electrochemical quantities on the edge/defect density of the basal plane. In this work, we employ a microdroplet electrochemical cell technique and atomic force microscopy to measure localized electrochemical properties of the graphitic surface with known edge coverage. The electron transfer rate, capacitance, and density of electronic states of the perfect basal plane and perfect edge plane are estimated, and a qualitative model is proposed for the dependence of the electrochemical quantities on the defect density of the basal plane.

Modes of Fe Incorporation in Co-Fe (Oxy)hydroxide Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts	CHEMSUSCHEM			English	Article						bimetallic catalysts; electrocatalysis; electrochemistry; heterogeneous catalysis; oxygen evolution	WATER OXIDATION; COBALT; IRON; FILMS; ELECTRODEPOSITION; CATALYST; DYNAMICS; ARRAYS; SITES	Ni-Fe (oxy)hydroxide and Co-Fe (oxy)hydroxide are among the most active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in alkaline media. Fe is essential for the high activity, but the details of how Fe is incorporated into the Ni or Co (oxy)hydroxide structure and affects catalysis remain incompletely understood. This study concerns two different modes of Fe incorporation to form Co(Fe)OxHy, which both yield increased OER activity but result in Fe and Co species that differ in chemical reactivity and electrochemical response. Co(Fe)OxHy films that were cathodically deposited from mixed Co and Fe nitrate solution (co-deposited) result in Fe species that interact strongly with the Co species (as evidenced by an anodic shift in the Co redox wave) and are difficult to leach out under electrochemical conditions. Fe incorporated into a CoOxHy film by cycling in Fe-spiked KOH electrolyte similarly enhance activity, but do not strongly electronically interact with the majority of the Co in the film and are removed by cycling in Fe-free KOH. These results support the hypothesis that co-deposition of Co(Fe)OxHy leads to films where the Co and Fe are mixed within the nanosheet structure and cycling in Fe-spiked KOH incorporates Fe species largely at surface, edge, or defect sites, where they drive OER but do not otherwise significantly modulate the electrochemical response of the Co.

Probing Size and Substrate Effects on the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction by Single Isolated Pt Atoms, Atomic Clusters, and Nanoparticles	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							OXYGEN REDUCTION; PARTICLE PROXIMITY; PLATINUM; OXIDATION; METAL; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; NANOMETER; SURFACE; ELECTRODEPOSITION; ELECTROCATALYSIS	We report the catalytic activity of a single, isolated Pt deposit on Bi and Pb supports to probe the size and substrate effects on the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Deposits were made electrolytically by an atom-by-atom method in a controlled plating; we prepared an individual Pt deposit on Bi and Pb ultramicroelectrodes (UMEs) such as a single isolated atom, clusters containing one to five Pt atoms, and nanoparticles to about 10 nm radius. A steady-state voltammogram on the single Pt deposits is observed by electrocatalytic amplification of the HER, with a negligible contribution by the HER at the substrate UME. A single Pt atom can act as an electrode for the HER, showing a diffusion-limiting current plateau in the voltammogram that can be used to estimate the radius of a single deposit. We simulated the voltammograms of the individual deposits, assuming the Volmer step of the HER is appropriate for a Pt cluster deposit, to obtain kinetic parameters for each deposit. The HER kinetics increases as the particle radius increases from similar to 0.2 to similar to 4 nm for Bi and Pb substrates and then reaches a limiting plateau. The limiting kinetics on the Bi substrate approaches that of bulk Pt while that on the Pb substrate is much smaller.

However, rapid capacity fading associated with huge volume variation upon the (de)lithiation of CuO has limited its practical application. To address this problem, herein, we report the fabrication of one-dimensional CuO nanochains via a facile wet chemical route. The chain structure consists of particles, with an average crystallite dimension of ca. 20-25 nm, connected through well-knit junctions, which helps to promote charge transfer at the electrode|electrolyte interface and accommodate the volume variation of the oxide. Due to these structural merits, the CuO nanochains exhibited excellent rate performance and stable electrochemistry versus Li, which could be promising anode materials for high-power Li-ion batteries.

Surface-Charge Effects on Voltammetry in Carbon Nanocavities	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							SINGLE-MOLECULE ELECTROCHEMISTRY; ION-TRANSPORT; FABRICATION; NANOPORES; ELECTRODES; ENRICHMENT; KINETICS; GOLD	Ion transport controlled by electrostatic interactions is an important phenomenon in biological and artificial membranes, channels, and nanopores. Here, we employ carbon-coated nanopipets (CNPs) for studying permselective electrochemistry in a conductive nanopore. A significant accumulation (up to 2000-fold) of cationic redox species and anion depletion inside a CNP by diffuse-layer and surface-charge effects in a solution of low ionic strength were observed as well as the shift of the voltammetric midpeak potential. Finite-element simulations of electrostatic effects on CNP voltammograms show permselective ion transport in a single conducting nanopore and semiquantitatively explain our experimental data. The reported results are potentially useful for improving sensitivity and selectivity of CNP sensors for ionic analytes.

Herein, we describe a dual-marker biosensor chip, integrating enzyme and antibody-based assays for simultaneous electrochemical measurements of insulin (I) and glucose (G). Simultaneous G/I sensing has been realized by addressing key fabrication and operational challenges associated with the different assay requirements and surface chemistry. The I immunosensor relies on a peroxidase-labeled sandwich immunoassay, while G is monitored through reaction with glucose oxidase. The dual diabetes biomarker chip offers selective and reproducible detection of picomolar I and millimolar G concentrations in a single microliter sample droplet within less than 30min, including direct measurements in whole blood and saliva samples. The resulting integrated enzymatic-immunoassay biosensor chip opens a new realm in point-of-care multiplexed biomarker detection.

Reported here is a combined electrochemical/photochemical method for dehydrogenative C(sp(3))-H/N-H coupling that exhibits good reactivity with both sp(2) and sp(3) N-H bonds. The results show how use of iodide as an electrochemical mediator, in combination with light-induced cleavage of intermediate N-I bonds, enables the electrochemical process to proceed at low electrode potentials. This approach significantly improves the functional-group compatibility of electrochemical C-H amination, for example, tolerating electron-rich aromatic groups that undergo deleterious side reactions in the presence of high electrode potentials.

Evidence for NADPH as the Sole Reducing Agent	ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING			English	Article						Biosynthesis; Nanoparticles; NADPH; Nitrate reductase; Single entity electrochemistry	MEDIATED SYNTHESIS; EXTRACELLULAR BIOSYNTHESIS; AGGREGATION; GROWTH	A leading hypothesis for silver nanoparticle biosynthesis suggests that the enzyme nitrate reductase plays a key role in the process, assisted by the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). Here, we show that NADPH alone can act as the reducing agent of silver nitrate salt to form silver nanoparticles. In fact, the addition of nitrate reductase during the synthesis causes a decrease in the reaction rate and broadening of the size distribution of the particles. The NADPH-synthesized particles were monodispersed with a mean radius of 5.1 +/- 1.0 nm, as indicated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging and supported further by in situ single entity electrochemistry. The bottom-up molecular approach enabled facile purification of the nanoparticles, and the minimal components allowed the determination of the kinetic parameters of the reaction. The kinetics of the biomolecular synthesis is shown to be a pseudo-first-order reaction with respect to NADPH with a rate constant of 6.6 x 10(-3) s(-1) at 25 degrees C. Finally, using 1 mM NADPH, the reaction was 90% completed within 7 minutes when run at 80 degrees C. These mechanistic insights provide a deeper understanding toward the future realization of environmentally friendly, rapid, and low-cost biomolecular synthesis agents for monodispersed nanoparticles.

Electrocatalytic Upgrading of Phenolic Compounds Observed after Lignin Pyrolysis	ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING			English	Article						Biomass; Pretreatment; Lignin depolymerization; Valorization; Pyrolysis; Bio-oil; Electrocatalytic hydrogenation; Electroreduction; Electrocatalyst; Ruthenium; Activated carbon; Electrochemistry	RANEY-NICKEL ELECTRODE; AQUEOUS-SOLUTIONS; CATALYTIC HYDRODEOXYGENATION; SUBSTITUTED PHENOLS; BIO-OIL; HYDROGENATION; CYCLOHEXANONE; ADSORPTION; PALLADIUM; GLYCEROL	Lignin valorization is increasingly important as biomass fractionation approaches achieve higher technology readiness levels. One approach to upgrade lignin first involves its deconstruction by fast pyrolysis to create a lignin-derived bio-oil. The phenolics-rich liquid product is a promising feedstock for electrocatalytic hydrogenation, as aromatics can be deoxygenated and saturated by hydrogen chemisorbed on catalytic cathodes, mitigating the product's corrosivity and raising its energy content. By integrating biomass fractionation with pyrolytic deconstruction and electrocatalytic upgrading, lignin can be valorized to fuels and chemicals that significantly enhance the profitability of biorefineries. In this study, model compounds representing lignin bio-oil components were subjected to electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) at mild temperatures using ruthenium on activated carbon cloth. Phenol, guaiacol, syringol, and several related alkyl phenols and aryl methyl ethers were studied. In addition to hydrogenation, C-O and C-C hydrogenolysis were observed. Conversion of the alkyl phenols decreased with increasing alkyl chain length. Similarly, for alkyl-substituted guaiacols, conversion decreased as alkyl chain length increased, and selectivity shifted away from demethoxylation, favoring alkyl-substituted 2-methoxycyclohexanol. Increasing substrate concentration improved the Faradaic efficiency up to a plateau at higher concentrations. By mapping out electrocatalytic conditions and reactivities of lignin-relevant substrates, this work further opens the door to the promise of biomass upgrading to fuels and chemicals via the pyrolysis-electrocatalysis pathway.

The electrochemical and chemical oxidations proceed by two distinct routes. Specifically, electrochemical oxidation undergoes a sequential two-step, one-electron (1e(-)) oxidation route with a 117 mV difference between consecutive half-wave potentials. In contrast, chemical oxidation by antimony(V) chloride (SbCl5) causes the generation of four different oxidized species: (a) the 1e(-) oxidation state, (b) a decomposition product, (c) the 2e(-) oxidation state, and (d) a chloride adduct of the 2e(-) oxidation state. The decomposition product is generated by the reaction of the 1e(-) oxidation state with residual water, resulting in nucleophilic aromatic substitution at the sulfide group terminal positions. This reaction leads to the formation of a 2e(-) oxidized, oxygen atom (ketone) terminated decomposed molecule. The chloride adduct is determined to be produced by electrophilic chloronium ion (2e) oxidation by the SbCl4+ complex, which is a product of SbCl5 ligand disproportionation. The formation of the 2e(-) oxidized chlorine adduct shows to be linearly dependent on the molarity of SbCl5 in dichloromethane, giving new insight into the concentration dependent reactivity of SbCl5 as a 2e(-) oxidant. The electronic, optical, and magnetic properties and geometric structures of the 1e(-) and 2e(-) oxidized hexachloroantimonate salts are fully characterized by a combination of electrochemistry, X-ray crystallography, UV-vis-NIR, electron paramagnetic resonance, NMR spectroscopies, and density functional theory calculations. The aim of this study is to provide a thorough understanding of the redox pathways of a D/A/D pi-conjugated organic molecule for potential application in organic electrochromic devices.

Polysulfide Reduction and Oxidation at MoS2, WS2 and Cu-Doped MoS2 Thin Film Electrodes	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							CHARGE STORAGE; TRANSITION; PERFORMANCE; NANOSHEETS; CATALYSTS; SODIUM; ENERGY; ANODE	The sluggish kinetics of cyclic polysulfide electrochemistry, where sulfur species typically range from S-2(2-) to S-6(2-), presents a challenge in several common electrochemical systems. Recently, transition metal dichalcogenides such as WS2 and MoS2 have been proposed for catalysis of polysulfide oxidation-reduction. Here electrodeposited WS2, MoS2, and Cu-doped MoS2 thin films are tested for 24 h cycling in an electrolyte containing 1.8 M Na2Sx + 1.0 M NaOH. Although their initial catalytic activity is high, electrodeposited WS2 films delaminated after similar to 4 h. The initial catalytic activity of MoS2 films is also high, but MoS2 gradually transforms to Mo2S3 during 24 h of polysulfide oxidation-reduction cycling, as shown by X-ray diffraction (XRD), cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The best results were obtained for Cu-doped MoS2, which exhibited both high catalytic activity and stable polarization curves during 24 h of potential cycling. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of MoS2 stabilization during cyclic polysulfide electrochemistry through incorporation of a metal dopant into MoS2.

The presence of gas phase chromium species in air has demonstrated significant cathode performance degradation during long-term exposure due to unwanted compound formation at the cathode and electrolyte interface which retards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). We have demonstrated a novel method to mitigate the cathode degradation using chromium getters which capture the gas phase chromium species before it is ingested in the cathode chamber. Low-cost getter materials, synthesized from alkaline earth and transition metal oxides, are coated on the cordierite honeycomb substrate for application in the SOFC power systems. As-fabricated getters have been screened by chromium transpiration tests for 500 h in humidified air atmosphere in presence of chromium vapor. Selected getters have been further validated utilizing electrochemical tests. Typically, electrochemical performance of SOFCs (lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM) parallel to yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) parallel to Pt) was measured at 850 degrees C in the presence and absence of Cr getter. For the 100 h cell tests containing getters, stable electrochemical performance was maintained, whereas the cell performance in the absence of Cr getters rapidly decreased in 10 h. Analyses of Nyquist plots indicated significant increase in the polarization resistance within the first 10 h of the cell operation. Characterization results from posttest SOFCs and getters have demonstrated the high efficiency of chromium capture for the mitigation of cell degradation.

The Role of Aluminum in Promoting Ni-Fe-OOH Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						oxygen evolution; nickel-aluminum oxyhydroxide; catalysis; atomic layer deposition; electrochemistry; nickel-iron oxyhydroxide	THIN-FILM; NICKEL (OXY)HYDROXIDE; HYDROGEN-PRODUCTION; METAL; HYDROXIDE; OXIDE; IRON; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; CATALYSTS; OXIDATION	Nickel-iron oxyhydroxide (Ni-Fe-OOH) catalysts have been widely studied for their high activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here we demonstrate improved OER activity through incorporation of a third cation, aluminum. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) was used to deposit thin films of nickel oxide (Ni-O) and nickel-aluminum oxide (Ni-Al-O) to measure activity for the OER. Electrochemical preconditioning of the oxide films led to the formation of the OER-active oxyhydroxide catalysts. For Ni-Al-O films, electrochemical preconditioning resulted in aluminum dissolution until a stable composition at a Ni:Al ratio of 9:1 was reached. Because iron can be incorporated into the films from the solution, compositional effects of iron were studied by controlling the iron impurity level in the electrolyte. Turnover frequencies (TOFs) were determined for each catalyst, and it was found that the highest performing electrocatalysts were the films containing nickel, aluminum, and iron, confirming that aluminum exerts a promotion effect on nickel oxyhydroxide catalysts. Studies showed that unlike the Ni-Fe-OOH films, for which the TOF had very little thickness dependence, the activity of Ni-Al-Fe-OOH catalysts was dependent on thickness. This effect may arise from morphological changes in the catalyst film that modulate the density of the active site with thickness. For the thinnest films, aluminum doping improved the TOF of Ni-Fe-OOH catalysts by over 3-fold.	[Baker, Jon G.; Schneider, Joel R.; Mackus, Adriaan J.

Redox-Based Synthetic Biology Enables Electrochemical Detection of the Herbicides Dicamba and Roundup via Rewired Escherichia coli	ACS SENSORS			English	Article						synthetic biology; biofabrication; redox; dicamba; diquat; Roundup	OXIDATIVE STRESS REGULON; CELLS; SOXR; GENES; WATER; GENOTOXICITY; SENSOR; ACID	Synthetic biology is typically exploited to endow bacterial cells with new biosynthetic capabilities. It can also serve to create "smart" bacteria such as probiotics that detect and treat disease. Here, we show how minimally rewiring the genetic regulation of bacterial cells can enable their ability to recognize and report on chemical herbicides, including those routinely used to clear weeds from gardens and crops. In so doing, we demonstrate how constructs of synthetic biology, in this case redox-based synthetic biology, can serve as a vector for information flow mediating molecular communication between biochemical systems and microelectronics. We coupled the common genetic reporter, beta-galactosidase, with the E. coli superoxide response regulon promoter pSoxS, for detection of the herbicides dicamba and Roundup. Both herbicides activated our genetic construct in a concentration dependent manner. Results indicate robust detection using spectrophotometry, via the Miller assay, and electrochemistry using the enzymatic cleavage of 4-aminophenyl beta-D-galactopyranoside into the redox active molecule paminophenol. We found that environmental components, in particular, the availability of glucose, are important factors for the cellular detection of dicamba. Importantly, both herbicides were detected at concentrations relevant for aquatic toxicity.

J	Gross, MM; Manthiram, A				Gross, Martha M.; Manthiram, Arumugam			Development of low-cost sodium-aqueous polysulfide hybrid batteries	ENERGY STORAGE MATERIALS			English	Article						Sodium-sulfur batteries; Hybrid batteries; Solid electrolytes; Aqueous polysulfides; Electrochemistry	LONG CYCLE LIFE; SULFUR BATTERIES; ENERGY-STORAGE; AIR BATTERY; ELECTROLYTE; METAL; COMPOSITES; SOLUBILITY; CHALLENGES; LIQUID	There has been increasing interest in sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries as an option for low-cost grid-scale energy storage. However, traditional Na-S batteries operate at high temperatures, raising concerns about long-term maintenance costs and safety. On the other hand, room-temperature Na-S batteries have their own limitations, including Na dendrite formation, polysulfide shuttling, and low utilization of active material. To overcome these issues, we present here a novel low-cost room-temperature sodium-aqueous polysulfide (Na-APS) hybrid battery system with a Na-metal anode, Na+-ion solid electrolyte separator, and an aqueous polysulfide catholyte. The solid electrolyte blocks Na dendrites and polysulfide shuttling while simultaneously protecting the reactive Na metal anode from the aqueous catholyte. The redox kinetics of the APS catholyte is improved with a rational development of a freestanding CuS-CNT catalytic electrode. The improvements with the Na-APS hybrid battery compared to the traditional Na-S battery systems are discussed. The Na-APS hybrid battery displays excellent performance under a 418 mA h g(-1) of sulfur capacity-restricted cycling. The battery achieves an energy efficiency of 90% over 100 cycles at 0.5 mA cm(-2) current density.

These CpG-PBNPs increase the antigenicity and adjuvanticity of the treated tumors, ultimately driving robust antitumor immunity through a multi-pronged mechanism. CpG-PBNPs are synthesized using a facile layer-by-layer coating scheme resulting in nanoparticles that exhibit monodisperse size distributions and multiday stability without cytotoxicity. The strong intrinsic absorption of PBNPs in the CpG-PBNPs enables ablative photothermal therapy (CpG-PBNP-PTT) that triggers tumor cell death, as well as the release of tumor antigens to increase antigenicity. Simultaneously, the CpG coating functions as an exogenous molecular adjuvant that complements the endogenous adjuvants released by the CpG-PBNP-PTT (e.g. ATP, calreticulin, and HMGB1). In cell culture, coating NPs with CpG increases immunogenicity while maintaining the photothermal activity of PBNPs. When administered in a syngeneic, Neuro2a-based, murine model of neuroblastoma, CpG-PBNP-PTT results in complete tumor regression in a significantly higher proportion (70% at 60 days) of treated animals relative to controls. Furthermore, the long-term surviving, CpG-PBNP-PTT-treated animals reject Neuro2a rechallenge, suggesting that this therapy generates immunological memory. Our findings point to the importance of simultaneous cytotoxicity, antigenicity, and adjuvanticity to generate robust and persistent antitumor immune responses against neuroblastoma.

These dyes need to meet several criteria to be effective for this purpose, including air stability, and an ability to be regenerated by common electrolytes. Both of these properties are related to the Fe(III/ II) reduction potentials. Here we show how the Fe(III/II) reduction potentials of Fe(II) complexes can be estimated from a single experimental Fe(III/II) reduction potential and computationally cheap calculations on single isolated ligands. This method requires refinement, but could prove highly useful for large-scale computational screening and design of Fe(II) dyes.

A highly selective and sensitive electrochemical sensor for tryptophan based on the excellent surface adsorption and electrochemical properties of PSS functionalized graphene	TALANTA			English	Article						Poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) functionalized graphene; Ascorbic acid; Tryptophan; Electrochemical sensor	GLASSY-CARBON ELECTRODE; VOLTAMMETRIC DETERMINATION; ASCORBIC-ACID; IN-SITU; URIC-ACID; NANOCOMPOSITE; OXIDE; REDUCTION; DOPAMINE; NANOPARTICLES	A new green method for the synthesis of poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) functionalized graphene (PSS-graphene) in aqueous solution was realized by using graphene oxide nanosheets (GO) functionalized with PSS and ascorbic acid (AA) as an reducing agent. Various techniques, including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and electrochemistry have been utilized to characterize the as -made nanocomposites. The PSS-graphene was used as a modifier to fabricate an electro-chemical sensor of tryptophan (Trp). Due to the difference of the adsorption capacity of PSS-graphene for Trp and Tyr, as well as the different charge states of Trp and the other interfering substances, the sensor showed excellent selectivity for Trp. The synergistic amplification of the stronger enrichment and the enhanced electron transfer rate, the signal of Trp on the PSS-graphene modified electrode was about 100-fold enhanced compared to that of the bare GCE. The peak current of Trp is proportional to its concentration in a wide range from 0.04 to 10.0 mu mol L-1 with detection limit of 0.02 mu mol L-1. Further, the proposed sensor was applied for the detection of Trp in human serum samples. Favorable results revealed that this work provided a new design strategy and a valuable platform for highly selective and sensitive determination of Trp in complex samples.

Their inherent metal-free redox activity remains understudied. Herein, we demonstrate that zwitterionic adducts of carbon dioxide formed with cyclic(alkyl)(amino) carbenes are not only redox active, but they can mediate the stoichiometric reductive disproportionation of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide and carbonate. Infrared spectroelectrochemical experiments show that the reaction proceeds through an intermediate radical anion formed by one-electron reduction, ultimately generating a ketene product and carbonate in the absence of additional organic or inorganic reagents.

J	Arunachalam, H; Onori, S				Arunachalam, Harikesh; Onori, Simona			Full Homogenized Macroscale Model and Pseudo-2-Dimensional Model for Lithium-Ion Battery Dynamics: Comparative Analysis, Experimental Verification and Sensitivity Analysis	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							DISCHARGE; CHARGE; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; IDENTIFICATION; DIFFUSION; DESIGN; STATE	Control-oriented models based on electrochemistry have conventionally been evaluated and designed from the Doyle-Fuller-Newman (DFN) macroscale model. However, the DFN model is susceptible in predicting battery response under certain operating conditions since it is an approximate representation of pore-scale dynamics. This work shows the limitations of the DFN model in predicting voltage response at high temperatures of cell operation. A full homogenized macroscale (FHM) model, developed in previous research, is shown to overcome these limitations. Results indicate that the predictability of the DFN model deteriorates when trying to predict the voltage response at low state of charge for high temperature of operation under 1 C-rate discharge. The influence of parameters on the model states and output is investigated as a means to address parameter identifiability issues, for which, we formulate and resolve sensitivity functions for the partial differential equations (PDEs) of the FHM model. Results show that parameter identifiability is dependent on the battery state of charge. (C) 2019 The Electrochemical Society.

A mononuclear water soluble polypyridyl cobalt complex [Co(N4-Py)(H2O)](PF6)(3) (4b) (N4-Py = N-methylpyridine-2,11-diaza[3,3](2,6)pyridinophane) was synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, mass spectrum, electrochemistry, and theoretical calculations. It is shown that 4b can catalyze both electro- and photocatalytic H-2 production in aqueous solutions. Photocatalytic H-2 production is achieved with a turnover number (TON) of 200 at pH 6 while electrolytic H-2 production is accomplished with a TON of 140 at pH 7. Results from DFT computations indicate that the penta-coordinated Co-II species is the active catalyst in the homogeneous H-2 evolution by 4b, and the generation of H-2 from a Co-II-H species occurring via mononuclear heterolytic coupling is favorable by -23.0 kcal/mol.

Direct Measurement of Water Permeation in Submerged Alkyl Thiol Self-Assembled Monolayers on Gold Surfaces Revealed by Neutron Reflectometry	LANGMUIR			English	Article							ORGANIZED MOLECULAR ASSEMBLIES; SCANNING-TUNNELING-MICROSCOPY; ELECTRON-TRANSFER KINETICS; ALKANETHIOL MONOLAYERS; STRUCTURAL-CHARACTERIZATION; 3-MERCAPTOPROPIONIC ACID; TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE; MONO LAYERS; LYING-DOWN; AU(111)	Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkyl thiols are frequently used to chemically functionalize gold surfaces for applications throughout materials chemistry, electrochemistry, and biotechnology. Despite this, a detailed understanding of the structure of the SAM-water interface generated from both formation and use of the SAM in an aqueous environment is elusive, and analytical measurements of the structure and chemistry of the SAM-water interface are an ongoing experimental challenge. To address this, we used neutron reflectometry (NR) to measure water association with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic SAMs under both wet and dry conditions. SAMs used for this study were made from hydrophobic decanethiol mixed with hydrophilic 11-azido-1-undecanethiol with compositions of 0-100% of the azide-terminated thiol. All SAMs were formed by conventional solution incubation of a Au substrate immersed in ethanol. Each SAM was characterized by grazing incidence angle reflection-absorption Fourier transfer infrared spectroscopy, contact angle goniometry, and electrochemical methods to confirm it was a completely formed monolayer with evidence of extensive crystalline-like domains. NR measured significant absorption of water into each SAM, ranging from 1.6 to 5.7 water molecules per alkyl thiol, when SAMs were immersed in water. Water infiltration was independent of SAM composition and terminal group hydrophilicity. These results demonstrate that water accesses defects, fluid regions, and heterogeneous domains inherent to even well-formed SAMs.	[Fies, Whitney A.; Wilder, Logan M.; Webb, Lauren J.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Chem, 2506 Speedway STOP A5300, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Fies, Whitney A.; Wilder, Logan M.; Webb, Lauren J.] Univ Texas Austin, Texas Mat Inst, 2506 Speedway STOP A5300, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Dugger, Jason W.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Ctr Nanophase Mat Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Browning, Katie L.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Mat Sci & Technol Div, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Doucet, Mathieu; Browning, James F.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Neutron Scattering Div, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Dick, Jeffrey E.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Chem, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA	Webb, LJ (reprint author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Chem, 2506 Speedway STOP A5300, Austin, TX 78712 USA.; Webb, LJ (reprint author), Univ Texas Austin, Texas Mat Inst, 2506 Speedway STOP A5300, Austin, TX 78712 USA.	lwebb@cm.utexas.edu	Dugger, Jason/J-3371-2016; Doucet, Mathieu/A-5333-2010	Dugger, Jason/0000-0002-1196-0205; Doucet, Mathieu/0000-0002-5560-6478	National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CHE-1361252, CHE-1807215, DGE-1110007]; Army Research Office [W911NF-17-1-0089]; Scientific User Facilities Division, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, U.S. Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE)	This research was supported through grants awarded by the National Science Foundation (CHE-1361252 and CHE-1807215 to LJ.W. and DGE-1110007 to J.E.D.) and Army Research Office (W911NF-17-1-0089 to LJ.W.).

Solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) water electrolysis is one of the most practical ways to produce pure H-2. Electrocatalysts are key materials in the SPE water electrolysis. At the anode side, electrode materials catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) require specific properties. Among the reported materials, only iridium presents high activity and is more stable. In this Minireview, an application overview of single iridium metal and its oxide catalysts-binary, ternary, and multicomponent catalysts of iridium oxides and supported composite catalysts-for the OER in SPE water electrolysis is presented. Two main strategies to improve the activity of an electrocatalyst system, namely, increasing the number of active sites and the intrinsic activity of each active site, are reviewed with detailed examples. The challenges and perspectives in this field are also discussed.

The electrochemical complexations in porous air electrodes are, however, a manifestation of coupled interface-transport-kinetic interactions. The non-equilibrium thermodynamics behind such multi-modal coupling, hitherto unappreciated, forms the central argument of this work.

Na0.44MnO2 (NMO) possesses S-shaped Na+ diffusion pathway that can accommodate insertion/deinsertion of large Na+, though the poor electronic conductivity of NMO limits its ionic transport kinetics. Herein, single crystalline NMO nanorods (NRs) were synthesized, and their electronic conductivity was enhanced by one order of magnitude using reduced graphene oxide (rGO), as quantified by local conductive atomic force microcopy (c-AFM) measurement. When used as a cathode material for SIBs, NMO/rGO nanocomposite exhibits reversible specific capacities of 124mAh/g at 0.2C after 200 cycles and 70.8mAh/g at 15C, which are significantly enhanced over control cathode made of pure NMO NRs. Through detailed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis, it was found that NMO/rGO nanocomposite exhibits much reduced Warburg factor, resulting in enhanced Na+ diffusion at each discharging voltage platform. This suggests that the enhanced electronic conductivity helps Na+ insertion/deinsertion, resulting in improved electrochemical performance, and these insights help us understand how electronic conductivity improves ionic transport kinetics in SIBs.

This is, however, a formidable challenge that will demand a new capability to tailor the electronic structure. Here, an original electronic structure tailoring of CoO by Ni and Zn dual doping is reported. This changes it from an inert material into one that is highly active for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Based on combined density functional theory calculations and cutting-edge characterizations, it is shown that dual Ni and Zn doping is responsible for a highly significant increase in HER activity of the host oxide. That is, the Ni dopants cluster around surface oxygen vacancy of the host oxide and provide an ideal electronic surface structure for hydrogen intermediate binding, while the Zn dopants distribute inside the host oxide and modulate the bulk electronic structure to boost electrical conduction. As a result, the dual-doped Ni, Zn CoO nanorods achieve current densities of 10 and 20 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of, respectively, 53 and 79 mV. This outperforms reported state-of-the-art metal oxide, metal oxide/metal, metal sulfide, and metal phosphide catalysts.

Rapid Excited-State Deactivation of BODIPY Derivatives by a Boron-Bound Catechol	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article							CHARGE SEPARATION	The excited-state dynamics and energetics of a series of BODIPY-derived chromophores bound to a catechol at the boron position were investigated with a combination of static and time-resolved spectroscopy, electrochemistry, and density functional theory calculations. Compared with the difluoro-BODIPY-derived parent compounds, the addition of the catechol at the boron reduced the excited-state lifetime by three orders of magnitude. Deactivation of the excited state proceeded through an intermediate charge-transfer state accessed from the initial optically excited pi* state in <1 ps. Despite differences in the structures of the BODIPY derivatives and absorption maxima that spanned the visible portion of the spectrum, all compounds exhibited the same, rapid, excited-state deactivation mechanism, suggesting the generality of the observed dynamics within this class of compounds.

Atmospheric Electricity Influencing Biogeochemical Processes in Soils and Sediments	FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						atmospheric electricity; bacterial respiration; biogeochemistry; Carnegie-curve; ions; redox potential	MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; DIURNAL PATTERNS; ORGANIC-MATTER; NITROUS-OXIDE; AIR-POLLUTION; REDOX; CONDUCTIVITY; BACTERIA; CIRCUIT; VARIABILITY	The Earth's subsurface represents a complex electrochemical environment that contains many electro-active chemical compounds that are relevant for a wide array of biologically driven ecosystem processes. Concentrations of many of these electro-active compounds within Earth's subsurface environments fluctuate during the day and over seasons. This has been observed for surface waters, sediments and continental soils. This variability can affect particularly small, relatively immobile organisms living in these environments. While various drivers have been identified, a comprehensive understanding of the causes and consequences of spatio-temporal variability in subsurface electrochemistry is still lacking. Here we propose that variations in atmospheric electricity (AE) can influence the electrochemical environments of soils, water bodies and their sediments, with implications that are likely relevant for a wide range of organisms and ecosystem processes. We tested this hypothesis in field and laboratory case studies. Based on measurements of subsurface redox conditions in soils and sediment, we found evidence for both local and global variation in AE with corresponding patterns in subsurface redox conditions. In the laboratory, bacterial respiratory responses, electron transport activity and H2S production were observed to be causally linked to changes in atmospheric cation concentrations. We argue that such patterns are part of an overlooked phenomenon. This recognition widens our conceptual understanding of chemical and biological processes in the Earth's subsurface and their interactions with the atmosphere and the physical environment.

In this paper, graphene was reviewed from three aspects. Firstly, several common fabrication methods and characteristics of graphene were introduced. Secondly, applications of the nanosized graphene (NG) and nanosized graphene oxide (NGO) in biosensor and medical imaging were discussed. The NG and NGO had the characteristics of photoluminescence. Based on the fluorescence quenching nature of the graphene surface, the targeting molecules could be confirmed by detecting the fluorescent substance. In addition, the graphene oxide (GO) had a promising prospect in the field of surface-enhanced Raman imaging. In the field of electrochemistry, graphene and its derivatives could be modified on the surface to couple with ligands and antigens and were able to detect specific biomolecules, such as glucose, DNA, proteins and etc. Thirdly, this paper introduced graphene applications in medical treatment. Due to the inherent high near-infrared (NIR) absorbance, graphene materials were widely used in the treatment of in vivo cancer photothermal therapy. The combination of the graphene, anticancer drugs, and specific antigens was highly efficient for drug delivery. This paper summarized the achievements of graphene materials in the medical diagnostics, the presents challenges, and the future prospect. (c) 2019 The Electrochemical Society.

Graphene nanosheets with different properties, including surface area, defect distance, and charge-transfer resistance, were fabricated and characterised in Si/Graphene nanocomposites formed by static-electric self-assembly then by an in-situ reduction process. Graphene nanosheets that exhibited the highest surface area, the shortest defect distance, and the lowest charge-transfer resistance demonstrated the best overall electrochemical performance, with a high initial discharge capacity of 2692 mAh g(-1), good cycling performance of 1135 mAh g(-1), at the 200th cycle at the current rate of 0.5 C.

The mass spectrometric studies have revealed an unprecedented reaction pathway for the Au-329 to Au-279 core size conversion reaction via three steps. First, ligand exchange with 4-tert-butylbenzenethiolate occurs, followed by simultaneous progression of ligand exchange and core-size conversion with the loss of one Au atom after another and finally reaching completion with full ligand exchange on Au-279. Typically, when a core size conversion occurs in molecule-like nanomolecules, different sizes have different electronic and structural properties; in this case, both the reactant and the product possess plasmonic behavior and bulk-like face centered cubic structures. Also, this is the first report to study the core size transformation involving a difference of 50 metal atoms but identical 84 ligand count.

Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have recently experienced an impressive resurgence owing to the earth's abundance of sodium resources and the similar electrochemistry of SIBs and the well-established LIBs. Nonetheless, whereas cost-effective and reliable graphite anodes have served as a cornerstone in current LIB technology, one of the major limitations of SIBs has been the inability to exploit graphite as an electrode because of its negligible sodium storage capability. Recently, however, dear progress has been made in preparing high-performance graphitic carbon anodes for SIBs with new findings on the mechanisms of sodium storage. Herein, this paper aims to review the progress made in understanding the sodium storage mechanisms in graphitic carbon materials and comprehensively summarize the start-of-the-art achievements by surveying the correlations among the type of graphitic material, microstructure, sodium storage mechanisms, and electrochemical performance in SIBs. In addition, perspectives related to practical applications, including the electrolyte, coulombic efficiency, and applicability in sodium-ion full cells, are also presented.

The rich physics of electrokinetic behavior near BPEs has not yet been rigorously studied, with our current understanding of such bipolar effects being restricted to steady-state conditions (under constant applied fields). Here, we reveal the dynamic electrokinetic and electrochemical phenomena that occur near nanoconfined BPEs throughout all stages of a reaction. Specifically, we demonstrate, both experimentally and through numerical modeling, that the removal of an electric field produces solution-phase charge imbalances in the vicinity of the BPE poles. These imbalances induce intense and short-lived nonequilibrium electric fields that drive the rapid transport of ions toward specific BPE locations. To determine the origin of these electrokinetic effects, we monitored the movement and fluorescent behavior (enhancement or quenching) of charged fluorophores within well-defined nanofluidic architectures via real-time optical detection. By systematically varying the nature of the fluorophore, the concentration of the electrolyte, the strength of the applied field, and oxide growth on the BPE surface, we dissect the ion transport events that occur in the aftermath of field-induced polarization. The results contained in this work provide new insights into transient bipolar electrokinetics that improve our understanding of current analytical platforms and can drive the development of new micro- and nanoelectrochemical systems.

Evolution of Structure and Lithium Dynamics in LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) Cathodes during Electrochemical Cycling	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							ION BATTERIES; NI-RICH; NMR; SPECTROSCOPY; MECHANISMS; MANGANESE; SPECTRA; LIXNIO2; SYSTEM	The nickel-rich layered oxide LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) is a promising future cathode material for lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles due to its high specific energy density. However, it exhibits fast voltage and capacity fading. In this article, we combine electrochemistry, operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD), and ex situ solid-state NMR spectroscopy to provide new insights into the structural changes and lithium dynamics of NMC811 during electrochemical charge and discharge, which are essential for a better understanding of its fast degradation. The evolution of the interlayer spacing is tracked by XRD, showing that it gradually increases upon delithiation before collapsing at high state-of-charge (SOC). Importantly, no two-phase O3 -> O1 transition is observed at high SOC, demonstrating that this cannot be a major cause of degradation. A strong increase of Li dynamics accompanies the increase of the interlayer spacing, which is shown by Li-7 NMR and electrochemical characterization. At high SOC, Li mobility drops considerably, and Li/vacancy ordering can be observed by NMR. A detailed analysis of Li-7 NMR spectra at different SOC is provided, demonstrating how Li NMR can be used to extract information on the dynamics of such challenging paramagnetic samples with several hundred different local Li environments. The insights on the evolution of structure and dynamics of NMC811 will further the understanding of its cycling behavior and contribute to the efforts of mitigating its performance fade.

J	Sonawane, A; Mujawar, MA; Bhansali, S				Sonawane, Apurva; Mujawar, Mubarak A.; Bhansali, Shekhar			Atmospheric Plasma Treatment Enhances the Biosensing Properties of Graphene Oxide-Silver Nanoparticle Composite	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							ELECTROCHEMISTRY; REDUCTION	This work presents an approach to tailor the properties of the graphene oxide-silver nanoparticle (GO-AgNPs) composite using room temperature atmospheric plasma treatment. In particular, the aerosolized deposition of graphene oxide-silver nanoparticle composite (GO-AgNPs), the rapid reduction of GO at room temperature, and AgNPs surface excitation are investigated in this work. The plasma treatment of aerosolized GO leads to the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) formation which is observed from the increase in D to G band ratio from 0.65 for GO to 1.2 for rGO in the Raman spectra. Scanning Electron Microscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy, and Selected Area Electron Diffraction patterns show that the plasma treatment leads to the morphological changes and the Electrochemical Impedance spectroscopy results show the improvement in the conductivity of the rGO-AgNP composite. To demonstrate the efficacy of the technique, plasma treated GO and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) composite is used for the electrode surface modification of the commercial screen-printed electrodes for the cortisol detection. The cyclic voltammetry scans to detect cortisol shows that the sensitivity of the surface modified electrodes is increased after plasma treatment. This room temperature atmospheric plasma annealing technique is of specific interest for rapid processing of nanoparticles on flexible surfaces without subjecting them to elevated temperatures.

Linked Picolinamide Nickel Complexes as Redox Carriers for Nonaqueous Flow Batteries	CHEMSUSCHEM			English	Article						batteries; nickel; nonaqueous; redox flow battery; redox potentials	METAL-AMIDE BOND; HIGH-ENERGY DENSITY; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; LIGANDS; ELECTROCHEMISTRY	The use of nickel complexes utilizing non-innocent ligands based on picolinamide to function as redox carriers in flow batteries was explored. The picolinamide moiety was linked together with -CH2CH2- (bpen), -CH2CH2CH2- (bppn), and -C6H4- (bpb) moieties, resulting in two, three, and four quasi-reversible waves, respectively, for the nickel complexes and >3V difference between the outermost positive and negative waves. The redox events were theoretically modelled for each complex, showing excellent agreement (<0.3V difference) between the experimental and modelled potentials. Bulk cycling of the most soluble complex, Ni(bppn), indicated only one of the three waves was reversible. Therefore, Ni(bppn) has the ability to act as a negative charge redox carrier in flow cells.

J	Kender, WT; Turro, C				Kender, William T.; Turro, Claudia			Unusually Slow Internal Conversion in N-Heterocyclic Carbene/Carbanion Cyclometallated Ru(II) Complexes: A Hammett Relationship	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							STATE ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURES; EXCITED-STATES; POLYPYRIDYL COMPLEXES; ULTRAFAST DYNAMICS; REDOX POTENTIALS; METAL-COMPLEXES; SOLAR FUELS; BASIS-SETS; RUTHENIUM; PHOTOPHYSICS	A series of six [Ru(bpy)(2)(NHC-R)](+) complexes were synthesized and characterized, where bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine and NHC-R is an N-heterocyclic carbene covalently linked to a carbanion with a number of substituents, R = -OMe (1), -Me (2), -H (3), -Cl (4), -CO2Et (5), and -NO2 (6). The effects of these strongly sigma-donating NHC-R ligands on the ground-state electronic structure and on the excited-state character and dynamics were probed using electrochemistry, TD-DFT calculations, and steady-state absorption and emission spectros-copies, along with ultrafast transient absorption and time-resolved IR measurements. The excitation of 1-5 with a 400 nm pulse (irf = 85 fs) results in the population of a high energy singlet state, S-n, that rapidly intersystem crosses into a high-lying triplet state, T-n. Over the course of 7-22 ps, T-n relaxes to the lowest lying triplet state, T-1, which is metal/ligand-to-ligand charge transfer, Ru-3(d)/NHC(pi) -> bpy(pi*) in character. These (ML)-M-3-LCT states decay to regenerate the ground state with lifetimes, tau, that range from <8 to 15 ns at 298 K and from 10 to 23 ns at 77 K in CH3CN. Both the excited-state lifetime at 77 K and the T-n -> T-1 rate of internal conversion of 1-5 are dependent on the substituent R, and the latter correlates with the Hammett parameter (sigma(+)(p))of the NHC-R ligand. Excitation of 1-5 with low energy light, 550-670 nm, does not result in the population of T-n, as only T-1 is observed. In the case of 6, excitation is expected to populate a Ru-1(d)/NHC(pi) -> NHC(pi*) state localized on the NHC-NO2 ligand, which decays to a higher energy Ru-3(d)/NHC(pi) -> NHC(pi*) state followed by internal conversion to the Ru-3(d)/NHC(pi) -> bpy(pi*) T-1 state with tau = 250 ps; the population of both states is independent of excitation wavelength in 6. This work demonstrates that the introduction of one NHC-R ligand in these complexes permits the population of a higher energy triplet state that decays to T-1 in the picosecond time range. The relatively slow T-n -> T-1 internal conversion in these complexes makes the population of the higher-energy state potentially useful for more efficient charge injection into semiconductors for solar energy conversion or to aid in accessing dissociative metal-centered states for drug delivery. Overall, this work shows the ability to synthetically access valuable excited-state dynamics using the two different Ru-C bonds of the asymmetric NHC-R ligands.

For LiNi1-x-yCoxMnyO2 (NCM) cathodes, abrupt anisotropic collapse of the layered lattice structure at deep charge is generally considered characteristic to high Ni content and can be effectively suppressed by elemental substitution. Herein, we demonstrate the lattice collapse is a universal phenomenon almost entirely dependent on Li utilization, and not Ni content, of NCM cathodes upon delithiation. With Li removal nearing 80 mol %, very similar c-axis lattice shrinkage of around 5% occurs concurrently for NCMs synthesized in-house regardless of nickel content (90, 70, 50, or 33 mol %); meanwhile, the a-axis lattice contracts for high-Ni NCM, but it expands for low-Ni NCM. We further reveal Co-Mn cosubstitution in NCM barely, if at all, affects several key structural aspects governing the lattice distortion upon delithiation. Our results highlight the importance of evaluating true implications of compositional tuning on high-Ni layered oxide cathode materials to maximize their charge-storage capacities for next-generation high-energy Li-ion batteries.

J	Sardar, S; Fabris, L; Javanmard, M				Sardar, Sakshi; Fabris, Laura; Javanmard, Mehdi			Improved Precision in Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering Quantification of Analyte through Dual-Modality Multisite Sensing	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							ELECTROCHEMICAL QUANTIFICATION; SERS QUANTIFICATION; GOLD NANOPARTICLES; AMINOTHIOPHENOL	Accurate quantification of analyte using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a desired, yet unfulfilled, ability that could enable a plethora of diagnostic- and defense-related applications. The major hurdles to overcome to achieve this goal are expensive manufacturing for highly ordered and reproducible substrates and low reproducibility of substrates produced through low cost methods. A technology that can set industry standards for manufacturing/processing of SERS substrates is still yet to be achieved. A dual-modality multisite sensing approach was developed, that overcomes the limitations experienced when fabricating bottom-up, reproducible, sensitive, and low-cost SERS substrates. Electrochemistry was combined with SERS for dual-modality sensing to improve precision by adding redundancy and encoding features, thus increasing measurement robustness and predictability. This technique works by calibrating SERS response with respect to active surface area, a parameter known to be proportional to charge, which can be estimated via electrochemical measurements. The dual-modality multisite measurement demonstrates at least 2.8X improvement in assay precision compared to the traditional single-site Raman measurements. The technique yields overall improved precision of measurement and is not limited to any particular SERS substrate or geometry, and thus it can be adapted and incorporated readily in any SERS sensing assay.

Jill			Cavity Carbon-Nanopipette Electrodes for Dopamine Detection	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							ELECTROCHEMICAL MEASUREMENTS; FIBER MICROELECTRODE; ASCORBIC-ACID; URIC-ACID; NANOELECTRODE; SENSORS; SENSITIVITY; PERFORMANCE; FABRICATION; RELEASE	Microelectrodes are typically used for neurotransmitter detection, but nanoelectrodes are not because there is a trade-off between spatial resolution and sensitivity that is dependent on surface area. Cavity carbon-nanopipette electrodes (CNPEs), with tip diameters of a few hundred nanometers, have been developed for nanoscale electrochemistry. Here, we characterize the electrochemical performance of CNPEs with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) for the first time. Dopamine detection using cavity CNPEs, with a depth equivalent to a few radii, is compared with that using open-tube CNPEs, an essentially infinite geometry. Open-tube CNPEs have very slow temporal responses that change over time as the liquid rises in the CNPE. However, a cavity CNPE has a fast temporal response to a bolus of dopamine that is not different from that of a traditional carbon-fiber microelectrode. Cavity CNPEs, with tip diameters of 200-400 nm, have high currents because the small cavity traps and increases the local dopamine concentration. The trapping also leads to an FSCV frequency-independent response and the appearance of cyclization peaks that are normally observed only with large concentrations of dopamine. CNPEs have high dopamine selectivity over ascorbic acid (AA) because of the repulsion of AA by the negative electric field at the holding potential and the irreversible redox reaction. In mouse-brain slices, cavity CNPEs detected exogenously applied dopamine, showing they do not clog in tissue. Thus, cavity CNPEs are promising neurochemical sensors that provide spatial resolution on the scale of hundreds of nanometers, which is useful for small model organisms or for locations near specific cells.

To integrate active membrane proteins into graphene-based materials for such applications, graphene's surface must be functionalized with lipids to mimic the biological environment of these proteins. Several studies have examined supported lipids on various types of graphene and obtained conflicting results for the lipid structure. Here, we present a correlative characterization technique based on fluorescence measurements in a Raman spectroscopy setup to study the lipid structure and dynamics on epitaxial graphene. Compared to other graphene variations, epitaxial graphene is grown on a substrate more conducive to production of electronics and offers unique topographic features. On the basis of experimental and computational results, we propose that a lipid sesquilayer (1.5 bilayer) forms on epitaxial graphene and demonstrate that the distinct surface features of epitaxial graphene affect the structure and diffusion of supported lipids.

Enhancement of the Electrical Properties of DNA Molecular Wires through Incorporation of Perylenediimide DNA Base Surrogates	CHEMPLUSCHEM			English	Article						bioelectronics; charge transport; nanoscale devices; nanotechnology; PTCDI	CHARGE-TRANSPORT; HOLE TRANSFER; BISIMIDE DYE; DEPENDENCE; DYNAMICS; PAIR; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; DEVICES	DNA has long been viewed as a promising material for nanoscale electronics, in part due to its well-ordered arrangement of stacked, pi-conjugated base pairs. Within this context, a number of studies have investigated how structural changes, backbone modifications, or artificial base substitutions affect the conductivity of DNA. Herein, we present a comparative study of the electrical properties of both well-matched and perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI)-containing DNA molecular wires that bridge nanoscale gold electrodes. By performing current-voltage measurements for such devices, we find that the incorporation of PTCDI DNA base surrogates within our macromolecular constructs leads to an approximately 6-fold enhancement in the observed current levels. Together, these findings suggest that PTCDI DNA base surrogates may enable the preparation of designer DNA-based nanoscale electronic components.

Visible ECL emission can be obtained with a reasonable quantum yield and stability. Blue ECL is rare and often suffers from stability and poor quantum efficiency. Blue ECL emission at 473 nm from organometallic halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs), CH3NH3PbCl1.08Br1.92, is reported here for the first time using tripropylamine (TPrA) as co-reactant. The blue ECL emission peak resembles its photoluminescence peak position. In addition to this blue emission peak, the ECL spectra of CH3NH3PbCl1.08Br1.92 PNCs also showed a broad ECL peak at 745 nm. Generation of the second ECL peak at 745 nm from CH3NH3PbCl1.08Br1.92 PNCs was can be explained by the existence of surface trap states on as-synthesized PNC due to incomplete surface passivation. Halide anion tunability of ECL emission from CH3NH3PbX3 (X: Cl, Br, I) PNCs is also demonstrated. The fluorescence microscopy image of single PNC and stability of selected single PNCs are presented in this with simultaneous acquisition of fluorescence spectra using 405-nm laser excitation. The photoluminescence (PL) decay was described by PL lifetime (tau) of 1.2 ns. The effect of the addition of surfactants (oleic acid and n-octylamine) on the fluorescence intensity and stability of CH3NH3PbCl1.08Br1.92 PNCs is also discussed.

Probing Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction at Individual Cu Nanostructures via Optically Targeted Electrochemical Cell Microscopy	JOURNAL OF ANALYSIS AND TESTING			English	Article						Electrochemistry; Electrochemical microscopy; Nanoparticles; CO2 reduction	ELECTRON-TRANSFER; SINGLE-MOLECULE; ELECTROREDUCTION; NANOPARTICLES; PARTICLE; ELECTRODEPOSITION; COLLISIONS	Optically targeted electrochemical cell microscopy (OTECCM) was applied to measure electrocatalytic rates at individual Cu nanoparticles (NPs) under electrolyte conditions relevant to CO 2 reduction. The electrocatalytic responses from individual NPs were found to exhibit a wide variation in behavior, with significant NP-to-NP variations in the magnitude of electrocatalytic currents and necessary overpotentials being observed. Correlations of these quantities with metrics of NP size suggest no significant variations in the inherent electrocatalytic activity of the NPs with size. Finite element simulations of diffusion in this system demonstrate the observed diffusion-limited currents are significantly smaller than expected, attributable to the presence of a significant amount of residual ligand on the surface of the Cu NPs, which were prepared via an organic phase synthesis. The results presented here further demonstrate the promise of techniques which employ correlated optical and electrochemical measurements, such as OTECCM, for studying electrocatalysis at individual NPs.

This advancement is significant, because the visual voltammogram captures the entire current-potential (i-E) relationship of a faradaic reaction in one image and is continuously generated over time. Therefore, we anticipate that this method will allow monitoring in redox systems that change over time. Further, the use of a linear array of BPEs eliminates the need to use a potentiostat and can be carried out with a simple DC power supply. Our experimental and numerical results demonstrate that the visual voltammogram is similar to a linear sweep voltammogram and therefore, information about the faradaic process can be extracted from the wave position, height, and shape.

However, this approach has not translated successfully into real clinical applications. One significant barrier has been the need to measure biomarkers in unpurified, complex cell and tissue lysates, which is difficult with DNA-modified electrodes because of crowding and nonspecific adhesion of biomolecules to the surface. Here, we discuss recent achievements in the control of DNA monolayer formation and the amplification of DNA CT signals that help to facilitate the detection of meaningful biomarkers from unprocessed, clinically relevant lysate samples.

Defect Sites Modulate Fouling Resistance on Carbon-Nanotube Fiber Electrodes	ACS SENSORS			English	Article						carbon nanotubes; carbon fiber; electrochemistry; serotonin; biofouling; fast-scan cyclic voltammetry	SCAN CYCLIC VOLTAMMETRY; RAMAN-SPECTROSCOPY; NEUROTRANSMITTER DETECTION; ENHANCED DETECTION; NADH DETECTION; IMMUNE-SYSTEM; MICROELECTRODES; DOPAMINE; SEROTONIN; SURFACE	Carbon nanotube (CNT) fiber electrodes have become increasingly popular electrode materials for neurotransmitter detection with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV). The unique properties of CNT fiber electrodes like increased electron transfer, sensitivity, waveform application frequency independence, and resistance to fouling make them ideal biological sensors for FSCV. In particular, their resistance to fouling has been observed for several years, but the specific physical properties which aid in fouling resistance have been debated. Here, we investigate the extent to which the presence of defect sites on the surface attenuate both chemical and biological fouling with FSCV. We compared traditional carbon-fiber microelectrodes (CFMEs) to pristine CNTs and functionalized CNTs. CFMEs and functionalized CNTs are highly disordered with a great deal of defect sites on the surface. The pristine CNTs have fewer defects compared to the purposefully functionalized CNTs and CFMEs. All electrode surfaces were characterized by a combination of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Chemical fouling was studied using serotonin, a popular neurotransmitter notoriously known for electrode fouling. To assess biological fouling, electrodes were implanted in brain tissue for 2 h. Defect sites on the carbon were shown to resist biofouling compared to pristine CNTs but were detrimental for serotonin detection. Overall, we provide insight into the extent to which the electrode surface dictates fouling resistance with FSCV. This work provides evidence that careful considerations of the surface of the CNT material are needed when designing sensors for fouling resistance.

Reactions at noble metal contacts with methylammonium lead triiodide perovskites: Role of underpotential deposition and electrochemistry	APL MATERIALS			English	Article							INDUCED DEGRADATION; GOLD; POLYCRYSTALLINE; PLATINUM; IODINE; DECOMPOSITION; ADSORPTION; CHEMISTRY; XPS; AU	Chemical reactivity of halide perovskites coupled with a low energy of formation makes it a challenge to characterize material properties and achieve long-term device stability. In this study, we elucidate electrochemical reactions occurring at the methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI(3))/Au interface. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy is used to identify a type of reduction/oxidation reaction termed underpotential deposition (UPD) involving lead, iodine, and hydrogen occurring at interfaces with noble metals. Changes in surface compositions and oxidation states suggest that UPD derived adsorbates at MAPbI(3)/Au interfaces lower the energy barrier for release of volatile HI and/or I-2 catalyzing degradation at exposed contacts. Additionally, comparison to PbI2/Au interfaces demonstrates that the presence of methylammonium/methylamine accelerates the formation of a Pb-0 adlayer on the Au. Reactions involving UPD Pb-0 can transform the typically anodic (hole collecting) Au to a cathode in a photovoltaic measurement. Cyclic voltammetry reveals electrochemical reaction peaks in indium tin oxide (ITO)/MAPbI(3)/Au devices occurring within voltage ranges commonly used for perovskite characterization. The electrochemical stability window of this device architecture is measured to be between -0.5 V and 0.9 V. Voltage induced interfacial reactions contribute to reversible electrochemical peaks, hysteresis, switchable perovskite diode polarity, and permanent degradation at larger voltages. These types of surface reactions alter the interface/interphase composition beyond ion accumulation, provide a source for the diffusion of defects, and contribute to electrode material dependent current-voltage hysteresis. Moreover, the results imply fundamental limitations to achieving high device stability with noble metals and/or methylammonium containing perovskites. (C) 2019 Author(s).

However, owing to their disadvantages of low current density and high over-potential, the practical application of these electrodes has been limited. Hence, it is highly desirable to explore new and high efficient electrode for CO2 reduction to CO. Ag2S has been widely studied as electrode material in electrochemistry due to its unique properties, such as high conductivity, chemical stability, and easy to be prepared. In this work, we have fabricated an Ag2S electrode via electro-oxidation of Ag in aqueous solution. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) confirm that Ag2S has been modified on Ag foil, which made the electrode surface roughness. And then, we have evaluated the performance of Ag2S electrode as the cathode for CO2 reduction in propylene carbonate/tetrabutylammonium perchlorate. The cathodic current density reaches to 9.85mA/cm(2), with the faradic efficiency for CO formation remaining stable at 92% during 4h long-term electrolysis.

Lithiation-induced deformation in electrodes calls attention to study the multiphysics coupling between mechanics and electrochemistry. In this paper, a simultaneous multi-scale and multiphysics model to study the coupled electrochemistry and mechanics in the continuum battery cell level and the microscale particle level was developed and implemented in COMSOL MULTIPHYSICS. In the continuum scale, the porous electrode theory and the classical mechanics model were applied. In the microscale, the specific particle structure has been incorporated into the model. This model was demonstrated to study the effects of mechanical constraints, charging rate, and silicon/C ratio, on the electrochemical performance. This model provides a powerful tool to perform simultaneous multiscale and multiphysics design on Li-ion batteries, from the particle level to full-cell level.

However, implantable BCI technology still faces challenges in the biocompatibility and long-term stability of devices after implantation. Due to the cone structure, needle electrodes have advantages in the biocompatibility and stability as nerve recording electrodes. This paper develops the fabrication of Ag needle micro/nano electrodes with a laser-assisted pulling method and modifies the electrode surface by electrochemical oxidation. A significant impedance reduction of the modified Ag/AgCl electrodes compared to the Ag electrodes is demonstrated by the electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS). Furthermore, the stability of modified Ag/AgCl electrodes is confirmed by cyclic voltammogram (CV) scanning. These findings suggest that these micro/nano electrodes have a great application prospect in neural interfaces.

Structural and electrochemical properties of babassu coconut mesocarp-generated activated carbon and few-layer graphene	CARBON			English	Article						Activated carbon; Graphene; Raman spectroscopy; Electrochemistry	HIGH-NITROGEN CONTENT; RAMAN-SPECTROSCOPY; POROUS CARBON; ELECTRODE MATERIALS; HEAT-TREATMENT; SURFACE-AREA; PERFORMANCE; BIOMASS; GRAPHITIZATION; CARBONIZATION	Activated Carbon (AC) with high specific surface area and elevated porosity was synthesized from babassu mesocarp by hydrothermal carbonization, followed by KOH activation-coupled pyrolysis and subjected to heat-treatment at three different temperatures to generate AC-1100, AC-1400 and AC-2200. Raman spectroscopy, X-Ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and N-2 adsorption-desorption were used to characterize structurally the synthesized materials and electrochemical studies to evaluate the capacitance properties. The Raman spectra showed sharpening of graphitic bands and decrease in intensities of amorphous bands with the increase of treatment temperature. AC-2200 showed a significant decrease of I-D/I-G due to the crystal growth in ab plane and drastic increase of I-2D/I-G due to graphitic ordering in c direction, further proven by sharpening of characteristic XRD peaks and visualization of few-layer well-formed graphite micro-crystals by TEM. Although gradual heat treatment resulted in an increase in sample crystallinity, the surface area and porosity decreased, leaving AC-2200 practically non-porous. These changes were reflected in their electrochemical properties as AC-1400 showed highest double layer capacitance owing to an optimization between structural ordering and retention of porosity, while the capacitance, as well as the resistance, of AC-2200, decreases dramatically due to loss of pores and increased crystallinity brought in by graphitization.

To efficiently design functional electrolytes for lithium batteries, it is particularly important to understand the relative solvating ability of each individual organic solvent, because most of the electrolyte systems are comprised of two or more electrolyte solvents. Using a newly developed internally referenced diffusion-ordered spectroscopy technique and diffusion coefficient-coordination ratio (D-) analysis, we successfully constructed a solvating power series for common electrolyte solvents. We demonstrated the usefulness of this solvating power series in designing more reliable electrolyte system by selecting an appropriate fluorinated electrolyte solvent for a high-voltage lithium metal battery (LMB) as an example. For a methyl(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)carbonate-based electrolyte, we identified fluoroethylene carbonate as a more desirable cyclic carbonate co-solvent than difluoroethylene carbonate for LMB due to its significantly higher ability to solvate lithium ions.

First, NaFe(HPO4)(2) was synthesized employing a hydro thermal route and its structure was determined from single crystal X-ray diffraction data. Subsequent Na and partial proton ion exchange with Li+ ion produced a known phase, Li2Fe(F10.6PO4)(2), and complete deprotonation of Li2Fe(H0.5PO4)(2) with Li+ by employing a solid-state ion-exchange route produced the new phase Li3Fe(PO4)(2). The structure of the latter was solved from synchrotron powder X-ray data by employing ab initio methods. All of these phases are highly crystalline, built up of similar connectivities between FeO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedral units. Magnetic susceptibility measurements and room-temperature 57Fe Mossbauer spectroscopic studies confirm the 3+ oxidation state of the compounds and their antiferromagnetic ordering with Li2Fe(1-16.6PO(4))(2) showing some interesting metamagnetic behavior. The compounds are stable up to 400 degrees C and undergo facile electrochemical lithium/sodium insertion through the reduction of Fe' to Fe'. Galvanostatic charge discharge studies indicate that up to 0.6 lithium ion and 0.5 sodium ion per formula unit can be inserted at average voltages of 3.0 and 2.75 V for lithium and sodium ion batteries, respectively, for NaFe(HPO4)(2). The partially Li ion exchanged compound Li2Fe(F10.5PO4)(2) showed better cycle life and experimentally achievable capacities up to 0.9 Li insertion with strong dependence on particle size. The electrochemical Li insertion in Li3Fe(PO4)(2) was also investigated. The electrochemistry of these three related phases were compared with each other, and their mechanism of Li insertion was investigated by ex situ PXRD.

This properties of two classes of organometallic DH derivatives - organic DH derivatives with metallocenyl substituents and species obtained by hydride reduction of 18-electron D+ sandwich cations - are discussed and compared to those of the corresponding D-2 molecules. 1,3-Dimethyl-2-metallocenyl-2,3-dihydro1H-benzo[d]imidazoles, Mc-DMBI-H (Mc = ferrocenyl [Fc], ruthenocenyl [Rc]), and 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-1H-benzo[c]imidazolium tetrakis(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl))borates, Mc-DMBI BAr'(-)(4) (Mc = Fc, Rc), have recently been reported as intermediates in the synthesis of the dimers (Mc-DMBI)(2); here their crystal structures are reported and compared to those of related molecules. The solution reactivity of the Mc-DMBI-H derivatives with a fullerene acceptor is similar to that of purely organic aryl-DMBI-H species. Previously reported (exo-H-eta(4)-pentamethylcyclopentadiene)(eta(5) -cyclopentadienyl)metal complexes, M(exo-H-Cp*H)Cp (M = Rh, Ir) and the new (eta-(5)pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)(eta(5)-1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexa-1,3-dien-5-yl)ruthenium, RuCp*(mesH), have also been examined as potential reductants for organic semiconductors; RuCp*(mesH) is particularly reactive, affording the radical anions of perylene diimide and 6,13-bis(tri(isopropyl)silylethynyl)pentacene. The electrochemistry of DH, D+, and D-2 species is compared for the five compounds. Density-functional theory calculations are used to gain insight into the trends in electrochemistry and reactivity.

J	Wu, B; Lu, W				Wu, Bin; Lu, Wei			A consistently coupled multiscale mechanical-electrochemical battery model with particle interaction and its validation	JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS			English	Article						Electrochemistry; Mechanics; Multiscale; Electrode; Battery	LITHIUM-ION BATTERY; COMPOSITE ELECTRODES; STRESS GENERATION; STORAGE PARTICLE; DIFFUSION; KINETICS; HOMOGENIZATION; DEFORMATION; SIMULATION; LITHIATION	As an inherent multiscale structure, a continuum scale battery electrode is composed of many microscale particles. Currently it is generally assumed that each particle is isolated while the stress in a particle only affects solid diffusion. The lack of mechanical interaction between particles and effect of stress on the electrochemical reaction rate makes mechanics and electrochemistry uncoupled at the continuum scale: an applied continuum scale stress in the electrode has no effect on the spatial distribution of electrochemical reaction in the electrode and vice versa. This paper first presents a multiscale model that couples mechanics and electrochemistry consistently at the microscopic and continuum scales. The microscopic particle stress is a superposition of the intra-particle concentration gradient-induced stress and the particle interaction stress, with the latter being related to the continuum scale stress through a representative volume element. The electrochemical charge transfer kinetics is generalized with the stress effect. Diffusion in a particle is described by a chemical potential that includes stress and phase transition. In a parallel effort, we develop a direct three-dimensional particle network model, which consists of realistic active material particles. Unlike the multiscale model, there is no scale separation and homogenization in the particle network model: all particles are modeled explicitly with fully coupled three-dimensional mechanical-electrochemical equations and the finite element method. The results from the particle network model are accurate and can serve as a standard, but the size of particle network that can be calculated is limited due to high computational cost. Comparison of results from the multiscale model and from the particle network model shows that the multiscale model gives good, satisfying accuracy while reducing the computational cost dramatically in comparison to the three-dimensional particle network model. The multiscale model is a power tool to address various coupled problems in the electrode, from inter-particle crack growth to electrode structure design for high performance and long cycle life.

Virus-templated Pt-Ni(OH)(2) nanonetworks for enhanced electrocatalytic reduction of water	NANO ENERGY			English	Article						Hydrogen evolution reaction; Electrocatalysis; M13 bacteriophage; 3D nanostructure; Biotemplating	HYDROGEN EVOLUTION ACTIVITY; HETEROGENEOUS ELECTROCATALYSTS; NICKEL HYDROXIDE; OXYGEN; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; OXIDES	Clean hydrogen production via water electrolysis is incumbent upon the development of high-performing hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalysts. Despite decades of commercial maturity, however, alkaline water electrolyzers continue to suffer from limitations in electrocatalytic activity and stability, even with noble metal catalysts. In recent years, combining platinum with oxophilic materials, such as metal hydroxides, has shown great promise for improving performance potentially by enabling stronger water dissociation at the surface of electrocatalysts. In this work, we leveraged the nanoscopic proportions and surface programmability of the filamentous M13 bacteriophage in the design, synthesis, and exceptional performance of 3D nanostructured biotemplated electrocatalysts for alkaline hydrogen evolution. We developed a facile synthesis method for phage-templated, Pt-Ni(OH)(2) nanonetworks, relying on scalable techniques like electroless deposition. After optimization of the platinum content, our materials display -4.9 A mg(Pt)(-1) at -70 mV versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, the highest reported mass activity in 1M KOH to date, and undergo minimal changes in overpotential under galvanostatic operation at -10 mA cm(geo)(-2).Looking forward, the performance of these catalysts suggests that biotemplating nanostructures with M13 bacteriophage offers an interesting new route for developing high-performing electrocatalysts.

These properties include (i) fast heterogeneous electron transfer (HET) at its basal plane and (ii) corrosion resistance beyond graphitic materials. To discover the structural basis for these properties, characterization of this nc-graphite was investigated with Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies, nano-indentation, density, X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric and elemental analyses. The results indicate that this nc-graphite is in Stage-2 of Ferrari's amorphization trajectory between amorphous carbon (a-C) and graphite with a sp(2)/sp(3) carbon ratio of 85/15. The nano-crystallites size of 1.5 nm from XRD is consistent with fast HET rates as this increases the density of electronic states at the Fermi-level. However, d-spacing from XRD is 0.350 nm vs. 0.335 for graphite. This wider distance does not explain its corrosion resistance. Literature trends suggest that increasing sp(2) content in a-C's increase both HET and corrosion rates. While nc-graphite's HET rate follows this trend, it exhibits higher than predicted corrosion resistance. In general, this form of nc-graphite matches the best examples of boron-doped diamond in HET and corrosion rates. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Thomas			Electron transfer processes occurring on platinum neural stimulating electrodes: pulsing experiments for cathodic-first, charge-imbalanced, biphasic pulses for 0.566 <= k <= 2.3 in rat subcutaneous tissues	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						neural stimulation; platinum electrodes; charge imbalance stimulation; tissue damage; platinum corrosion	DISSOLUTION	Objective. Charge injection through platinum neural stimulation electrodes is often constrained by the Shannon limit (Shannon 1992 IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng. 39 424-6) of k = 1.75. By leveraging the tools of electrochemistry to better understand the reactions at electrode-tissue interface, we endeavor to find a way to safely inject more charge than allowed if the traditional Shannon limit were followed. Approach. In previous studies on platinum electrodes using charge-balanced, cathodic-first, biphasic pulses, we noted that during the secondary anodic phase, the electrode potential moves into a range where platinum dissolution is possible when charge injection is greater than k = 1.75. Platinum dissolution products are known to be toxic to brain tissues. We hypothesize that by injecting less charge in the anodic phase than the cathodic phase, the anodic potential excursions will decrease, thereby avoiding potentials where platinum dissolution is more likely. Main results. Our findings show that using these charge-imbalanced pulses decreases the anodic potential excursions to a level where platinum oxidation and dissolution are less likely, and aligns the anodic potentials with those observed with charge-balanced stimulation at k < 1.75-a range widely accepted as safe for stimulation with platinum. Significance. From these results, we further hypothesize that charge-imbalanced biphasic stimulation would permit more charge to be safely injected through platinum electrodes than would be permitted if the dogma of charge-balanced biphasic stimuli were followed. Testing this hypothesis in cat brain in the same manner as the experiments that formed the basis for the Shannon plot could open the door for safe charge injection through platinum electrodes at levels greater than k = 1.75.

In this work, a small strontium deficiency was introduced into SrCo0.8Nb0.1Ta0.1O3-delta (S100CNT) to promote the electrochemical activity of ORR. Cation deficient Sr0.95Co0.8Nb0.1Ta0.1O3-delta (S095CNT) displayed higher oxygen vacancy concentration than that of stoichiometric S100CNT. The decreased average bonding energy (ABE) and the increased critical radius (r(c)) of S095CNT could be responsible for the decreased activation energy for oxygen ions transfer. Consequently, the ORR activity of S095CNT cathode was significantly improved. The S095CNT cathode shows an area specific resistance of 0.07 Omega cm(2) at 650 degrees C, which was only about 63% of S100CNT. Moreover, S095CNT displayed much higher CO2 tolerance than the state-ofthe-art Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) cathode for SOFC. Thus, the fast ORR and high stability makes S095CNT promising material for devices involving oxygen electrochemistry such as solid oxide fuel cells, electrolysis cells, or gas separation membranes.

UV plasmonic properties of colloidal liquid-metal eutectic gallium-indium alloy nanoparticles	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ULTRAVIOLET; SINGLE; LIGHT; EGAIN	Nanoparticles made of non-noble metals such as gallium have recently attracted significant attention due to promising applications in UV plasmonics. To date, experiments have mostly focused on solid and liquid pure gallium particles immobilized on solid substrates. However, for many applications, colloidal liquid-metal nanoparticle solutions are vital. Here, we experimentally demonstrate strong UV plasmonic resonances of eutectic gallium-indium (EGaIn) liquid-metal alloy nanoparticles suspended in ethanol. We rationalise experimental results through a theoretical model based on Mie theory. Our results contribute to the understanding of UV plasmon resonances in colloidal liquid-metal EGaIn nanoparticle suspensions. They will also enable further research into emerging applications of UV plasmonics in biomedical imaging, sensing, stretchable electronics, photoacoustics, and electrochemistry.

Currently, batteries beyond typical Li-ion batteries such as those based on solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) or other active elements (e. g., Na or Mg) are being examined as alternatives. For example, SSEs that would enable stable and reliable operation of all-solid-state Li-, Na-, and Mg-based batteries, with preferably improved capacity, are considered to be one of the most desired inventions. Lightweight complex metal hydrides are a family of solid compounds that were recently discovered to have extraordinary ionic conductivities and, in some cases, electrochemical properties that enabled battery reversibility. Consequently, they have become one of the promising electrolyte materials for future development of electrochemical storage devices. In this work, we present an overview of a wide range of lightweight hydride-based materials that could be used as electrolytes and/ or anodes for mono-/ divalent batteries and have a pivotal role in the implementation of new technological solutions in the field of electrochemistry.

In this work, we report on the synthesis and electrochemical properties of materials composed of porous cobalt selenide microspheres prepared from molecular cluster precursors. The cobalt selenide microspheres excel as Na+ ion battery electrode materials, with a specific capacity of similar to 550 mA h/g and excellent cycling stability of 85% over 100 cycles, and perform equally well as Li+ ion battery electrodes with a specific capacity of similar to 600 mA h/g and cycling stability of 80% over 100 cycles. Materials which reversibly store large amounts of Na+ ions are uncommon, and these performances represent significant advances in the field. More broadly, this work establishes metal chalcogenide molecular clusters as valuable precursors for creating new, tunable energy storage materials.

In comparison to the related 2,2'-bipyridyl (bpy) reference complexes, [M(bpy)(CO)(3)(CH3CN)](+) (M = Mn or Re), the Me(2)OQN(-)-based precatalysts exhibit an onset of catalytic current with the input of one less equivalent of electrons. This behavior is attributed to the formal Me(2)OQN((center dot/-)) redox couple which contributes toward each catalytic cycle in tandem with the formal Mn-(I/0) and Re-(I/0) redox couples. In addition to computational support for synergistic metal-ligand redox cooperativity, electrochemistry (cyclic voltammetry and controlled potential electrolysis), spectroelectrochemistry (FTIR and EPR), and pulse radiolysis coupled with time-resolved infrared spectroscopy (PR-TRIR) provide structural insight into the electronic properties of the one-electron- and two-electron-reduced species..

Substantial differences in their reactivity and interactions with other compounds depending on the substituent X and cluster size n have been recognized, which favor specific closo-borates for different applications in cancer treatment, chemical synthesis, and materials science. Surprisingly, a fundamental understanding of the molecular properties underlying these differences is lacking. Here, we report our study comparing the electronic structure and reactivity of closo-borate anions [closo-BnXn](2-) (X = Cl, Br, I, n = 10, 11, 12 in all combinations) in the gas phase and in solution. We investigated the free dianions and the ion pairs [nBu(4)N](+)[closo-BnXn](2-) by gas phase anion photoelectron spectroscopy accompanied by theoretical investigations. Strong similarities in electronic structures for n = 10 and 11 were observed, while n = 12 clusters were different. A systematic picture of the development in electronic stability along the dimension X is derived. Collision induced dissociation shows that fragmentation of the free dianions is mainly dependent on the substituent X and gives access to a large variety of boron-rich molecular ions. Fragmentation of the ion pair depends strongly on n. The results reflect the high chemical stability of clusters with n = 10 and 12, while those with n = 11 are much more prone to dissociation. We bridge our study to the condensed phase by performing comparative electrochemistry and reactivity studies on closo-borates in solution. The trends found at the molecular level are also reflected in the condensed-phase properties. We discuss how the gas phase values allow evaluation of the influence of the condensed phase on the electronic stability of closo-borates. A synthetic method via an oxidation/chlorination reaction yielding [closo-B10Cl10](2-) from highly chlorinated {closo-B-11} clusters is introduced, which underlines the intrinsically high reactivity of the {closo-B-11} cage.

The biosensor integrates cellular machines (i.e., microtubules, structural elements of cells and kinesin molecular motors involved in cellular transport) as functional units; its assembly is based on molecular self-assembly and self-recognition. Our results demonstrate that the designed biosensor was capable of allowing detection of binding and unbinding events based on redox reactions at user-controlled electrode interfaces. The analysis also showed that the sensitivity of the designed biosensor or its ability to record such events could be user-controlled at any given time by adjusting the energy source that "fuels" the system.

This work reports the design and synthesis of eight discrete, functionalised Mn(III) pyridyl salen metal complexes, in which the diamine is varied. The electrochemical properties of the complexes were examined using cyclic voltammetry (CV), spectroelectrochemical (SEC) techniques and Density Functional Theory (DFT) computational modelling to explore the mechanisms that underly Mn salen reduction chemistry. We briefly examine the electrochemistry of these complexes in the presence of CO2. These complexes represent potential ligands for incorporation into both discrete and extended metallosupramolecular assemblies.

Projections estimate that worldwide, more than 125 million EVs will be on the road by 2030. At the heart of these advanced vehicles is the lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery which provides the required energy storage. This paper presents and compares key components of Li-ion batteries and describes associated battery management systems, as well as approaches to improve the overall battery efficiency, capacity, and lifespan. Material and thermal characteristics are identified as critical to battery performance. The positive and negative electrode materials, electrolytes and the physical implementation of Li-ion batteries are discussed. In addition, current research on novel high energy density batteries is presented, as well as opportunities to repurpose and recycle the batteries.

Cp* Noninnocence Leads to a Remarkably Weak C-H Bond via Metallocene Protonation	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							METAL-PI-COMPLEXES; COUPLED ELECTRON-TRANSFER; CATALYTIC-REDUCTION; AMMONIA; FE; DINITROGEN; HYDROGEN; SITE; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; REACTIVITY	Metallocenes, including their permethylated variants, are extremely important in organometallic chemistry. In particular, many are synthetically useful either as oxidants (e.g., Cp2Fe+) or as reductants (e.g., Cp2Co, Cp-2*Co, and Cp-2*Cr). The latter have proven to be useful reagents in the reductive protonation of small-molecule substrates, including N-2. As such, understanding the behavior of these metallocenes in the presence of acids is paramount. In the present study, we undertake the rigorous characterization of the protonation products of Cp-2*Co using pulse electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques at low temperature. We provide unequivocal evidence for the formation of the ring-protonated isomers Cp*(exo/endo-eta(4)-C5Me5H)Co+. Variable temperature Q-band (34 GHz) pulse EPR spectroscopy, in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) predictions, are key to reliably assigning the Cp*(exo/endo-eta(4)-C5Me5H)Co+ species. We also demonstrate that exo-protonation selectivity can be favored by using a bulkier acid and suggest this species is thus likely a relevant intermediate during catalytic nitrogen fixation given the bulky anilinium acids employed. Of further interest, we provide physical data to experimentally assess the C-H bond dissociation free energy (BDFEC-H) for Cp*(exo-eta(4)-C5Me5H)Co+. These experimental data support our prior DFT predictions of an exceptionally weak C-H bond (<29 kcal mol(-1)), making this system among the most reactive (with respect to C-H bond strength) to be thoroughly characterized. These data also point to the propensity of Cp*(exo-eta(4)-C5Me3H)Co to mediate hydride (H-) transfer. Our findings are not limited to the present protonated metallocene system. Accordingly, we outline an approach to rationalizing the reactivity of arene-protonated metal species, using decamethylnickelocene as an additional example.

By ejecting NPs onto a closely positioned ultramicroelectrode (UME), one can study single-particle collision electrochemistry in acid concentrations as high as 3 M or 750 mM on the electrode surface. This is nearly 2 orders of magnitude greater than previously reported in NP-collision studies. The use of high-bandwidth recording and higher acid concentration allows us to temporally resolve the ultrafast hydrogen adsorption and evolution processes in HER on single colliding Pt NPs. Moreover, the electroactive surface area (EASA) and roughness factor (Rf) of single Pt NPs can be readily derived from the integrated hydrogen adsorption charge. The use of high acid concentrations is critical toward obtaining a full monolayer of adsorbed hydrogen before overlapping with the evolution process. This method allows one to study electrochemical and electrocatalytic behavior of metal NPs in a chemical environment that is close to that used in real applications, for example, fuel cells and electrolyzers.

X-ray crystallography and electrochemistry reveal electronic and steric effects of phosphine and phosphite ligands in complexes Ru-II(kappa(4)-bda)(PR3)(2) and Ru-II(kappa(3)-bda)(PR3)(3) (bda=2,2 '-bipyridine-6,6 '-dicarboxylato)	POLYHEDRON			English	Article						Ruthenium; Phosphine and phosphite ligands; X-ray crystallography; DFT; Electrochemistry	1,3,5-TRIAZA-7-PHOSPHAADAMANTANE PTA; COORDINATION CHEMISTRY; PHOSPHORUS LIGANDS; WATER; PSEUDOPOTENTIALS	We have examined coordination of PR3 = triphenylphosphine, triethylphosphine, triisopropyl phosphite, trimethyl phosphite, and 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane (PTA) to the fragment Ru-II(bda) to better understand how different phosphine and phosphite ligands influence the electronic and structural properties of the Ru-II complexes. PTA and P(OMe)(3) afforded complexes with three phosphorus ligands bound to Ru, with the bda being tridentate (kappa(3)-N,N,O) in complexes 4 and 5; for the other three phosphorus ligands, even in the presence of >2 equiv, only Ru-II(kappa(4)-bda)(PR3)(2) species 1-3 were seen. Both experimental and computational methods were used to study the complexes. Steric effects are the main factor determining whether bis- or tris(PR3) complexes are formed. Cyclic voltammetry studies of the complexes revealed an increase in Ru-III/II potential upon having another phosphorus ligand in the equatorial position. Computational studies predict that the additional phosphine ligand in the equatorial plane of 4 engages in significant orbital mixing with the ruthenium center that results in lower energy bonding as compared to the axial phosphine ligands. This work provides the first evaluation of phosphorus ligand steric and electronic effects on the Ru-II(bda) fragment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

During a constant current electrolysis almost any oxidation and reduction reaction can be paired, and in the presented work we capitalize on this observation by examining the coupling of anodic oxidation reactions with the production of hydrogen gas for use as a reagent in remote, Pd-catalyzed hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions. To this end, an alcohol oxidation, an oxidative condensation, intramolecular anodic olefin coupling reactions, an amide oxidation, and a mediated oxidation were all shown to be compatible with the generation and use of hydrogen gas at the cathode. This pairing of an electrolysis reaction with the production of a chemical reagent or substrate has the potential to greatly expand the use of more energy efficient paired electrochemical reactions.

Impact of Synthesis Method on Phase Transformations of Layered Lithium Vanadium Oxide upon Electrochemical (De)lithiation	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							X-RAY-DIFFRACTION; CATHODE MATERIAL; LIV3O8 NANOSHEETS; PERFORMANCE; INSERTION; LI1.1V3O8; BATTERY; ELECTRODES	Li1.1V3O8 (LVO) has shown promise as a cathode material for lithium-based batteries due to its high theoretical capacity (360 mAh.g(-1)) and good rate capability; however, LVO batteries suffer from capacity fade upon extended cycling. The impact of synthetic material control on electrochemistry and capacity retention was explored through solvothermal synthesis of LVO fibers and sol-gel synthesis of LVO rhombohedrons. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of the twomaterials revealed key differences where lithiation of the solvothermal-derived LVO material resulted in less beta phase formation as compared with the sol-gel-derived material. Structural evolution of the materials during lithiation was characterized through in situ XRD which revealed that the alpha ->beta phase conversion is essentially complete in the sol-gel product with only partial conversion in the solvothermal product. Under galvanostatic cycling, the sol-gel product delivered higher capacity but displayed more capacity fade as compared to the solvothermal product as foretold by both CV and XRD findings. When cycled within the a phase region, improved preservation of both energy delivery and structural integrity was observed. These findings substantiate the proposed cause of capacity degradation as originating from an alpha ->beta structural change and illustrate the possibility of minimizing alpha ->beta phase formation through synthetic control of LVO.

Tuning oxygen electrocatalysis via strain on LaNiO3(001)	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							PEROVSKITE OXIDE CATALYSTS; TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; REDUCTION ACTIVITY; CO CHEMISORPTION; EVOLUTION; SURFACES; WATER; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; ELECTROLYSIS; MECHANISMS	The slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution (OER) and oxygen reduction (ORR) reactions hamper the development of renewable energy storage and conversion technologies. Transition-metal oxides (TMOs) are cost-effective replacements to conventional noble metal catalysts for driving these electrochemical systems. Strain is known to greatly affect the electronic structure of TMO surfaces, leading to significant changes in their electrocatalytic activities. In this study, we explore the influence of strain on the OER and ORR mechanisms on the LaNiO3(001) surface using density functional theory (DFT). Through a comparison of the overpotential and the largest change in Gibbs free energy (DG) in the reaction pathway, we determined that the OER activity on the LaNiO3 surface is directly related to the desorption of-H from the surface, which can be tuned as a function of strain. Moreover, tensile strain shuts off the reaction pathway to forming the-O2H intermediate state, due to the dissociation of -O2H into -O-2 and-H. This is largely a consequence of the strong binding of H to the surface O, leading to a significant increase in the largest DG for the ORR on the tensile-strained surfaces by promoting an alternative reaction pathway. Overall, our results show that tensile strain on LaNiO3(001) leads to a decrease in both OER and ORR activities. Interestingly, in both cases, we find that the reaction is driven by the interactions with surface O ions, thus calling for a reinterpretation of the role that Ni eg orbital polarization plays in defining the OER and ORR catalytic activity on the TMO surfaces. Here, it is an indirect measure of changes in Ni-O hybridization, which controls the binding of-H species to the surface. As such, these results highlight the importance of surface O ions; particularly as it relates to defining molecule-surface interactions that ultimately tune and enhance the electrocatalytic efficiency of perovskite materials through the modulation of strains.

Recent studies have revealed that multiphase transport of ions, oxygen (O-2) gas, and electrons also plays a fundamental role in lithium-oxygen (Li-O-2) batteries. The similarity in transport behavior of both systems is the inspiration for the development of Li-O-2 batteries from natural wood featuring noncompetitive and continuous individual pathways for ions, O-2, and electrons. Using a delignification treatment and a subsequent carbon nanotube/Ru nanoparticle coating process, one is able to convert a rigid and electrically insulating wood membrane into a flexible and electrically conductive material. The resulting cell walls are comprised of cellulose nanofibers with abundant nanopores, which are ideal for Li+ ion transport, whereas the unperturbed wood lumina act as a pathway for O-2 gas transport. The noncompetitive triple pathway design endows the wood-based cathode with a low overpotential of 0.85 V at 100 mA g(-l), a record-high areal capacity of 67.2 mAh cm(-2), a long cycling life of 220 cycles, and superior electrochemical and mechanical stability. The integration of such excellent electrochemical performance, outstanding mechanical flexibility, and renewable yet cost-effective starting materials via a nature-inspired design opens new opportunities for developing portable energy storage devices.

Toward Environmentally Friendly Lithium Sulfur Batteries: Probing the Role of Electrode Design in MoS2-Containing Li-S Batteries with a Green Electrolyte	ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING			English	Article						MoS2 nanosheet; Sulfur; Li-S battery; Polysulfide; Electrode design; Green electrolyte	POLYSULFIDE SHUTTLE; RATIONAL DESIGN; BINDER-FREE; PERFORMANCE; ENHANCEMENT; DISULFIDE; COMPOSITE; MECHANISM; MEMBRANE; SITES	While lithium sulfur batteries (Li-S) hold promise as future high energy density low cost energy storage systems, barriers to implementation include low sulfur loading, limited cycle life, and the use of toxic electrolyte solvents. A comprehensive study of Li-S cells in the environmentally benign di(propylene glycol) dimethyl ether (DPGDME)-based electrolyte, using as-prepared MoS2 nanosheets derived from a facile aqueous microwave synthesis as polysulfide trapping agents, is reported herein for the first time. Conventional coated foil electrodes and binder-free electrodes (BFEs) with various structures are systematically generated and tested to correlate electrode design with the resulting electrochemical behavior. Significantly improved Li-S electrochemistry is demonstrated through the synergy of MoS2 chemistry and binder-free electrode engineering. In the coating configuration, the MoS2-containing cell evinced better rate performance and more stable cyclability than the cell without MoS2. In comparison with the coating counterparts, the BFE cells exhibited excellent cycle stability and superior rate capability (10-fold capacities and energy density per electrode weight with 20% higher retention rate) despite 2X higher areal sulfur loading. The BFE cell improvement can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the i) interconnected macroporous structure of CNT interlayers, providing a conductive framework, and ii) the efficient polysulfide trapping by the MoS2 nanosheets.

Corrosion Initiation and Propagation on Carburized Martensitic Stainless Steel Surfaces Studied via Advanced Scanning Probe Microscopy	MATERIALS			English	Article						corrosion; bearing steels; martensitic stainless steel; aerospace; atomic force microscopy (AFM); scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPFM); nanoscale; electrochemistry; wear; Pyrowear 675; AMS 5930	MAGNETIC FORCE MICROSCOPY; POTENTIAL MEASUREMENTS; LOCALIZED CORROSION; BEARING STEELS; MICROSTRUCTURE; BEHAVIOR; SKPFM; AFM; TEMPERATURE; AA2024-T3	Historically, high carbon steels have been used in mechanical applications because their high surface hardness contributes to excellent wear performance. However, in aggressive environments, current bearing steels exhibit insufficient corrosion resistance. Martensitic stainless steels are attractive for bearing applications due to their high corrosion resistance and ability to be surface hardened via carburizing heat treatments. Here three different carburizing heat treatments were applied to UNS S42670: a high-temperature temper (HTT), a low-temperature temper (LTT), and carbo-nitriding (CN). Magnetic force microscopy showed differences in magnetic domains between the matrix and carbides, while scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy (SKPFM) revealed a 90-200 mV Volta potential difference between the two phases. Corrosion progression was monitored on the nanoscale via SKPFM and in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM), revealing different corrosion modes among heat treatments that predicted bulk corrosion behavior in electrochemical testing. HTT outperforms LTT and CN in wear testing and thus is recommended for non-corrosive aerospace applications, whereas CN is recommended for corrosion-prone applications as it exhibits exceptional corrosion resistance. The results reported here support the use of scanning probe microscopy for predicting bulk corrosion behavior by measuring nanoscale surface differences in properties between carbides and the surrounding matrix.

The nanofibrous Na-2 x 4-MnO2 was thoroughly characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), N-2 sorption, and electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) and is assigned a formula of Na0.25MnO2.0.16H(2)O. The electrochemistry of Na-2 x 4-MnO2 in non-aqueous Li, Na and Mg batteries is compared for the first time and first cycle delivered capacities were found to be 152mAh/g, 86mAh/g, and 307mAh/g, respectively. Characterization of the active material after electrochemical tests demonstrated that Na-2 x 4-MnO2 preserved both its crystallographic structure and nanofibrous morphology after cycling in Na and Li cells, however, Na-2 x 4-MnO2 lost its crystalline structure after cycling in a Mg based system.

However, its poor conductivity highly limits its applications. Here, the structural stability and conductivity of LTO were studied using in situ high-pressure measurements and first-principles calculations. LTO underwent a pressure-induced amorphization (PIA) at 26.9 GPa. The impedance spectroscopy revealed that the conductivity of LTO improved significantly after amorphization and that the conductivity of decompressed amorphous LTO increased by an order of magnitude compared with its starting phase. Furthermore, our calculations demonstrated that the different compressibility of the LiO6 and TiO6 octahedra in the structure was crucial for the PIA. The amorphous phase promotes Li+ diffusion and enhances its ionic conductivity by providing defects for ion migration. Our results not only provide an insight into the pressure depended structural properties of a spinel-like material, but also facilitate exploration of the interplay between PIA and conductivity.

Exploiting network topology for large-scale inference of nonlinear reaction models	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE			English	Article						reaction network; network inference; model selection; Bayesian inference; reversible-jump MCMC		The development of chemical reaction models aids understanding and prediction in areas ranging from biology to electrochemistry and combustion. A systematic approach to building reaction network models uses observational data not only to estimate unknown parameters but also to learn model structure. Bayesian inference provides a natural approach to this data-driven construction of models. Yet traditional Bayesian model inference methodologies that numerically evaluate the evidence for each model are often infeasible for nonlinear reaction network inference, as the number of plausible models can be combinatorially large. Alternative approaches based on model-space sampling can enable large-scale network inference, but their realization presents many challenges. In this paper, we present new computational methods that make large-scale nonlinear network inference tractable. First, we exploit the topology of networks describing potential interactions among chemical species to design improved 'between-model' proposals for reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo. Second, we introduce a sensitivity-based determination of move types which, when combined with network-aware proposals, yields significant additional gains in sampling performance. These algorithms are demonstrated on inference problems drawn from systems biology, with nonlinear differential equation models of species interactions.

However, detailed lithium insertion and extraction mechanisms have not yet been clearly understood and explained. Here we report low-temperature synthesis of electrochemically active FeF3/FeF2 nanoparticles by catalytic decomposition of a fluoropolymer [perfluoropolyether (PFPE)] using a hydrated iron oxalate precursor both in air and in inert atmosphere. Freshly synthesized FeF3 nanoparticle delivered specific capacity above 210 mAh/g with decent cycling performance as a Li-ion battery cathode. Both in situ and ex situ characterization techniques were used to investigate the detailed PFPE decomposition and fluorination mechanisms leading to FeF3/FeF2 formation as well as the lithium insertion mechanism in a FeF3 cathode. Specifically, a detailed understanding was investigated using thermogravimetry-mass spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption near-edge structure. The novel synthesis route developed not only offers access to electrochemically active metal fluorides but also offers a catalytic approach for decomposing highly inert fluoropolymers for environmental protection.

Here, we review our past efforts to understand how deep-sea hydrothermal vents may harness thermal energy to promote difficult chemical reactions such as CO2 reduction. Strategies to amplify the driving force using temperature will be covered first, followed by a discussion on how spatially separated thermodynamic gradients can be used to regulate reaction selectivity. Although desirable material properties of hydrothermal vent walls have been inferred previously from the bioenergetic membranes of modern cells, strategies based on fundamental laws of physical chemistry allow naturally occurring chimney minerals to circumvent the lack of structural and catalytic optimization. The principles that underlie both the establishment and the utilization of the thermodynamic driving force at hydrothermal vents can be employed in abiotic systems such as the modern chemical industry, yielding insight into carbon fixation reactions important today and possibly at the autotrophic origin of life.

In Situ Nanoscale Redox Mapping Using Tip-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy	NANO LETTERS			English	Article						Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS); nanoscale electrochemical imaging; site-dependent electrochemistry; Nernst equation	SCANNING ELECTROCHEMICAL MICROSCOPY; SINGLE-MOLECULE; CARBON NANOTUBES; SURFACE; FABRICATION; ELECTRODES; NANOPARTICLES; FLUCTUATIONS; DIMENSIONS; DEPENDENCE	Electrochemical atomic force microscopy tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (EC-AFM-TERS) was used for the first time to spatially resolve local heterogeneity in redox behavior on an electrode surface in situ and at the nanoscale. A structurally well-defined Au(111) nanoplate located on a polycrystalline ITO substrate was studied to examine nanoscale redox contrast across the two electrode materials. By monitoring the TERS intensity of adsorbed Nile Blue (NB) molecules on the electrode surface, TERS maps were acquired with different applied potentials. The EC-TERS maps showed a spatial contrast in TERS intensity between Au and ITO. TERS line scans near the edge of a 20 nm-thick Au nanoplate demonstrated a spatial resolution of 81 nm under an applied potential of -0.1 V vs Ag/AgCl. The intensities from the TERS maps at various applied potentials followed Nernstian behavior, and a formal potential (E-0') map was constructed by fitting the TERS intensity at each pixel to the Nernst equation. Clear nanoscale spatial contrast between the Au and ITO regions was observed in the E-0' map. In addition, statistical analysis of the E-0' map identified a statistically significant 4 mV difference in E-0' on Au vs ITO. Electrochemical heterogeneity was also evident in the E-0' distribution, as a bimodal distribution was observed in E-0' on polycrystalline ITO, but not on gold. A direct comparison between an AFM friction image and the E-0' map resolved the electrochemical behavior of individual ITO grains with a spatial resolution of similar to 40 nm. The variation in E-0' was attributed to different local surface charges on the ITO grains. Such site-specific electrochemical information with nanoscale spatial and few mV voltage resolutions is not available using ensemble spectroelectrochemical methods. We expect that in situ redox mapping at the nanoscale using EC-AFM-TERS will have a crucial impact on understanding the role of nanoscale surface features in applications such as electrocatalysis.

A modified one-step Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction was performed on monoformyl porphyrin to get ethenyl-linked mono-beta-porphyrin dyads in good to excellent yields (70-90 %). Red-shifted absorption and emission spectra were observed as compared to unsubstituted pristine tetraphenylporphyrins due to pi-extended donors. Time-resolved fluorescence studies confirmed the effective intramolecular Forster energy transfer from the donor moiety to the porphyrin core in anthracene- and pyrene-appended porphyrin dyads. DFT and TD-DFT optimization signified that the orientation of the donor and acceptor plays a vital role in energy transfer as co-planarity of the donor with the porphyrin core increases the energy transfer efficiency. The distribution of electron density on HOMOs and LUMOs indicated an excitation energy transfer (EET) mechanism from the donor moiety to the porphyrin acceptor core. All porphyrin dyads exhibited a cathodic shift in their oxidation potential suggesting facile oxidation of the porphyrin core due to pi-extension and the presence of electron-donating moieties. Finally, femtosecond transient absorption spectral studies were performed to secure evidence of excitation transfer and kinetic information of the energy transfer event in the dyads.

The Ag layer was subsequently covered by silver chloride (AgCl) with the aid of e-beam evaporation. The functionality of the tQREs as reliable reference electrodes was confirmed by observing the potential response in solutions with various chloride ion concentrations. The influence of solution pH on the potential change of the tQREs was evaluated. In the solution with controlled ionic strength, the tQREs were able to provide stable and consistent potential outputs. Experimental investigation of the electrochemical sensors with integrated tQREs demonstrated potential applicability of the tQREs to be incorporated into miniaturized and disposable lab-on-a-chip sensors for point-of-care/in-situ measurements.

Although several interesting mechanisms have been proposed, a general mechanism explaining the observed electrochemical processes is still missing, which is essentially originating from the remaining uncertainty on the complex hard carbons structure. The achievement of an in-depth understanding of the processes occurring upon sodiation, however, is of great importance for a rational design of optimized anode materials. In this review, we aim at providing a comprehensive overview of the up-to-date known structural models of hard carbons and their correlation with the proposed models for the sodium-ion storage mechanisms. In this regard, a particular focus is set on the most powerful analytical tools to study the structure of hard carbons (upon de-/sodiation) and a critical discussion on how to interpret and perform such analysis. Targeting the eventual commercialization of hard carbon anodes for sodiumion batteries - after having established a fundamental understanding - we close this review with a careful evaluation of potential strategies to ensure a high degree of sustainability, since this is undoubtedly a crucial parameter to take into account for the future large-scale production of hard carbons.

However, practical applications of Li-S batteries are mainly hindered by the insulating nature of sulfur and its intermediates, the polysulfide shuttle effect, and the formation and growth of lithium dendrites. Polymer materials play an important role in addressing these issues of Li-S batteries and their structures and functionalities can be manipulated to control the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries (e.g., cylability, rate capability, lifespan, etc.). In this review, we concentrate on the recent development of various polymer materials for Li-S batteries. It starts with a brief introduction of the Li-S battery followed by its fundamental electrochemistry and challenges. Significant attention is then paid to the applications of various polymers in each component of Li-S batteries with a focus on the mechanisms behind their operation which are presented and further discussed from five perspectives: i) polymers in cathodes, ii) polymer electrolytes, iii) polymer interlayers, iv) polymer separators, and v) polymers for the lithium metal anode protection. The aim is to present a detailed review of the critical aspects related to the functional polymers that can be used as important resources for researchers working in a diverse range of fields dealing with Li-S batteries. Finally, conclusions and perspectives are presented. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Enhanced Electrocatalytic Activities by Substitutional Tuning of Nickel-Based Ruddlesden-Popper Catalysts for the Oxidation of Urea and Small Alcohols	ACS CATALYSIS			English	Article						electrochemistry; Ruddlesden-Popper; perovskite; urea; electrooxidation; methanol; ethanol	ION DIFFUSION-COEFFICIENTS; METHANOL OXIDATION; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; NANOSHEET ARRAYS; PEROVSKITE; ELECTROOXIDATION; NI; ELECTRODES; CHEMISTRY; MECHANISM	The electrooxidation of urea continues to attract considerable interest as an alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as the anodic reaction in the electrochemical generation of hydrogen due to the lower potential required to drive the reaction and the abundance of urea available in waste streams. Herein, we investigate the effect of Sr-substitution in a series of La2-xSrxNiO4+delta Ruddlesden-Popper catalysts on the electrooxidations of urea, methanol, and ethanol and conclude that activities toward the urea oxidation reaction increase with increasing Ni oxidation state. The 75% Sr-substituted La0.5Sr1.5NiO4+delta catalyst exhibits a mass activity of 588 mA mg(ox)(-1) and 7.85 A mg(-1) cm(ox)(-2) for the electrooxidation of urea in 1 M KOH containing 0.33 M urea, demonstrating the potential applications of Ni-based Ruddlesden-Popper materials for direct urea fuel cells and low-cost hydrogen production. Additionally, we find the same correlations between Ni oxidation state and activities for the electrooxidations of methanol and ethanol, as well as identify processes that result in catalyst deactivation for all three oxidations. This demonstration of how systematically increasing Ni - O bond covalency by raising the formal oxidation state of Ni above +3 serves to increase catalyst activity for these reactions will act as a governing principle for the rational design of catalysts for the electrooxidation of urea and other small molecules going forward.

J	Venkatraman, K; Gusley, R; Lesak, A; Akolkar, R				Venkatraman, Kailash; Gusley, Ryan; Lesak, Andrew; Akolkar, Rohan			Electrochemistry-enabled atomic layer deposition of copper: Investigation of the deposit growth rate and roughness	JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY A			English	Article							LIMITED REDOX REPLACEMENT; E-ALD; UNDERPOTENTIAL DEPOSITION; EPITAXIAL-GROWTH; METAL-DEPOSITION; ELECTRODEPOSITION; CU; NUCLEATION; MONOLAYER; NANOFILMS	Electrochemical atomic layer deposition (e-ALD) presents a low-cost, environmentally friendly and scalable approach for the atomically precise fabrication of semiconductor interconnect materials. In the present work, growth rate and roughness evolution during e-ALD of copper (Cu) were analyzed using anodic stripping coulometry, atomic force microscopy, and diffusion-reaction modeling. Through considerations of the unsteady-state diffusional transport of species and their associated surface electrochemical reactions, a semianalytical e-ALD process model is developed. The model enables quantification of the e-ALD growth rate and the deposit surface roughness as a function of various e-ALD process parameters, i.e., electrolyte composition and deposition time. Model predictions are compared with experimental data and good agreement is noted. The model is used to develop guidelines for the selection of optimal process parameters that enable e-ALD of Cu with minimal roughness evolution and a deposit growth rate close to one monolayer-per-cycle.

Electron transfer from photoexcited naphthalene-1,4:5,8-bis(dicarboximide) radical anion to Mn(bpy)(CO)(3)X and Re(bpy)(CO)(3)X CO2 reduction catalysts linked via a saturated methylene bridge	JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY A-CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Femtosecond spectroscopy; Electrochemistry; Electron transfer; Radical anions; CO2 reduction; Solar energy	CHARGE SEPARATION; MANGANESE; RHENIUM; ELECTROCATALYSTS; PHOTOCATALYSTS; COMPLEXES; DYNAMICS; SYSTEMS	Supramolecular systems that connect a naphthalene-1,4:5,8-bis(dicarboximide) (NDI) radical anion donor to Mn (bpy)(CO)(3)Br or Re(bpy)(CO)(3) Cl CO2 reduction catalysts via a methylene bridge have been synthesized and studied by femtosecond transient visible, near-infrared and mid-infrared spectroscopy. The use of the methylene bridge to link NDI to the complexes does not affect the reduction potentials of the metal complexes. Selective photoexcitation of NDI center dot- to (2)*NDI center dot- results in ultrafast reduction of the bipyridine (bpy) ligands on both the Mn and Re complexes to form Mn(I)(bpy(center dot-))(CO)(3)X and Re(I)(bpy(center dot-))(CO)(3)X in near unity quantum yield, respectively. The initial formation of Mn(I)(bpy(center dot-))(CO)(3)X is unexpected based on previous electrochemical data that indicates the Mn(I) center is reduced at a more positive potential than the bpy ligand. Moreover, the rate of forward electron transfer in the Mn complex was found to be faster than in the Re complex, while the rate of the back electron transfer in the Re complex was faster than in the Mn complex.
