Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is the most actively studied hole transport material in p-i-n structured PSCs. However, charge transport in the PEDOT:PSS is limited and inefficient because of its low conductivity with the presence of the weak ionic conductor PSS. In addition, morphology of the underlying PEDOT:PSS layer in PSCs plays a crucial role in determining the optoelectronic quality of the active perovskite absorber layer. This work is focused on realization of a non-wetting conductive surface of hole transport layer suitable for the growth of larger perovskite crystalline domains. This is accomplished by employing a facile solvent-engineered (ethylene glycol and methanol) approach resulting in removal of the predominant PSS in PEDOT:PSS. The consequence of acquiring larger perovskite crystalline domains was observed in the charge carrier dynamics studies, with the achievement of higher charge carrier lifetime, lower charge transport time and lower transfer impedance in the solvent-engineered PEDOT:PSS-based PSCs. Use of this solvent-engineered treatment for the fabrication of MAPbI(3) PSCs greatly increased the device stability witnessing a power conversion efficiency of 18.18%, which corresponds to similar to 37% improvement compared to the untreated PEDOT:PSS based devices.

All-inorganic, hole-transporting-layer-free, carbon-based planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with these CsPbIBr2 thin films (FTO/c-TiO2/CsPbIBr2/C) were fabricated. The effect of different first-step annealing temperatures during the two-step temperature-control process (50 degrees C/280 degrees C, 80 degrees C/280 degrees C, 100 degrees C/280 degrees C, 150 degrees C/280 degrees C, 180 degrees C/280 degrees C) on the photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs was investigated for the first time. When the first-step annealing temperature was 150 degrees C and the second-step annealing temperature was 280 degrees C, the highest efficiency of 8.31% was obtained. Without encapsulation, the solar cell could retain 97% of the initial PCE, when it was stored at 80 degrees C and zero humidity for 8 days. For comparison, solar cells with CsPbIBr2 films annealed by a one-step temperature-control process were fabricated. The highest PCE was 4.98%. From this, we could see that there is an increase of 66.9% in PCE, through using a two-step temperature-control annealing process. And also, in order to investigate why the PSCs by a two-step temperature-control annealing process has a higher PCE, all kinds of measurements were done for the first time. According to the results of the measurements, the perovskite film annealed by a two-step temperature-control process has a bigger crystal size, fewer grain boundaries, stronger PL and UV-vis absorption intensities, longer lifetime of minority carriers, less energy loss for hole transporting.

The reported all-inorganic, HTLF, carbon-based cesium lead iodide dibromide (CsPbIBr2) solar cells used titanium dioxide (TiO2) as ETMs, which usually required a high sintering temperature of 500 degrees C. Here, ZnO ETMs were annealed at 120 degrees C. The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.60%, with a short-circuit current (J(sc)) of 11.60 mA/cm(2), an open-circuit voltage (V-oc) of 1.03 V and the fill factor (FF) of 0.63, was obtained. Furthermore, the thermal and humid stabilities of the solar cells were studied. The perovskite solar cells were placed at 10% humidity and room temperature for 624 h and the PCE of perovskite solar cells only decreased by 10%. While the perovskite solar cells were placed at 80 degrees C and 0% humidity for 192 h, the PCE of the solar cells decreased by 4%. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The unencapsulated F-PSCs can maintain 80 % of its initial value after 150 days exposed to ambient environment, the outstanding stability was among the best shelf stability ever reported for F-PSCs. Remarkably, a model based on the single heterojunction thin film solar cell was employed to clarify the irreversible degradation mechanism of the F-PSCs based on the evolution of the essential parameters during the aging process, like the ideality factor (A), series resistance (R-s) and the reverse saturated current density (J(0)). Our findings shed deep insight into the degradation mechanism of F-PSCs, and favorable for rational optimizing both the efficiency and stability of perovskite-based optoelectric device.

Thin-film encapsulation is known as a powerful approach to notably enhance the operational stability of perovskite solar cells in humid environment. However, encapsulation layers with ideal gas barrier performance always require harsh fabrication conditions with high temperature and harmful precursors. For this reason, here we provide a mild encapsulation strategy to maintain the original performance of solar cell devices by utilization of ethylene glycol-induced immediate layer to minimize the damage of plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition to perovskite solar cells. The organic-inorganic alternating encapsulation structure has exhibited a water vapor transmittance rate of 1.3 x 10(-5) g m(-2).day(-1), which is the lowest value among the reported thin film encapsulation layers of perovskite solar cells. Our perovskite solar cells have survived at 80% relative humidity and 30 degrees C for over 2000 h while preserving 96% of its initial performance.

The ability to probe chemical gradients through the depth of a device (both organic and inorganic), with down to 100 nm lateral resolution, can lead to unique insights into the relationships between chemistry in the absorber bulk, at grain boundaries, and at interfaces as well as how they relate to changes in performance and/or stability. In this review, the technique is described; then, from the literature, several examples of how TOF-SIMS have been used to provide unique insight into PSC absorbers and devices are covered. Finally, the common artifacts that can be introduced if the data are improperly collected, as well as methods to mitigate these artifacts are discussed.

However, charge separation and transport in 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) suffer from quantum well barriers formed during the processing of perovskites. It is extremely difficult to manage phase distributions in 2D perovskites made from the stoichiometric mixtures of precursor solutions. Herein, a generally applicable guideline is demonstrated for precisely controlling phase purity and arrangement in RPP films. By visually presenting the critical colloidal formation of the single-crystal precursor solution, coordination engineering is conducted with a rationally selected cosolvent to tune the colloidal properties. In nonpolar cosolvent media, the derived colloidal template enables RPP crystals to preferentially grow along the vertically ordered alignment with a narrow phase variation around a target value, resulting in efficient charge transport and extraction. As a result, a record-high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.68% is demonstrated for a (TEA)(2)(MA)(2)Pb3I10 (n = 3) photovoltaic device with negligible hysteresis. Remarkably, superior stability is achieved with 93% retainment of the initial efficiency after 500 h of unencapsulated operation in ambient air conditions.

Solution-processed polymeric thin film with transparency ranging from 300 to 7000 nm and superior electrical conductivity as the transparent electrode is reported. Solution-processed flexible broadband photodetectors with a "vertical" device structure incorporating a perovskite/PbSe quantum dot bilayer thin film based on the above solution-processed transparent polymeric electrode are demonstrated. The utilization of perovskite/PbSe quantum dot bilayer thin film as the photoactive layer extends spectral response to infrared region and boosts photocurrent densities in both visible and infrared regions through the trap-assisted photomultiplication effect. Operated at room temperature and under an external bias of -1 V, the solution-processed flexible photodetectors exhibit over 230 mA W-1 responsivity, over 1011 cm Hz1/2/W photodetectivity from 300 to 2600 nm and approximate to 70 dB linear dynamic ranges. It is also found that the solution-processed flexible broadband photodetectors exhibit fast response time and excellent flexibility. All these results demonstrate that this work develop a facile approach to realize room-temperature operated ultrasensitive solution-processed flexible broadband photodetectors with "vertical" device structure through solution-processed transparent polymeric electrode.

Recently, a conceptually new beta-CsPbI3 perovskite reached 18.4 % efficiency combined with good thermodynamic stability at ambient conditions. We use ab initio non-adiabatic molecular dynamics to show that native point defects in beta-CsPbI3 are generally benign for nonradiative charge recombination, regardless of whether they introduce shallow or deep trap states. These results indicate that MHPs do not follow the simple models used to explain defect-mediated charge recombination in the conventional semiconductors. The strong tolerance is due to the softness of the perovskite lattice, which permits separation of electrons and holes upon defect formation, and only allows carriers to couple to the low-frequency vibrations. Both factors decrease notably the non-adiabatic coupling and slow down the dissipation of energy to heat.

In this Review, we discuss solution-based and vapour-phase coating methods for large-area perovskite films and examine the progress in performance and the parameters affecting large-area coatings. Since the report in 2012 of a solid-state perovskite solar cell (PSC) with a power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.7% and a stability of 500 h, intensive efforts have been made to increase the certified PCE, reaching 25.2% in 2019. The PCE of PSCs now exceeds that of conventional thin-film solar-cell technologies, and the rate at which this increase has been achieved is unprecedented in the history of photovoltaics. Moreover, the development of moisture-stable and heat-stable materials has increased the stability of PSCs. Small-area devices (<1 cm(2)) are typically fabricated using a spin-coating method; however, this approach may not be suitable for the preparation of the large-area (>100 cm(2)) substrates required for commercialization. Thus, materials and methods need to be developed for coating large-area PSCs. In this Review, we discuss solution-based and vapour-phase coating methods for the fabrication of large-area perovskite films, examine the progress in performance and the parameters affecting the properties of large-area coatings, and provide an overview of the methodologies for achieving high-efficiency perovskite solar modules.

However, the fabrication of high-quality CsPbBr3 polycrystalline films using solution-based process is very challenging. Due to the low solubility of CsBr in precursor solutions, solution-processed CsPbBr3 films are typically discontinuous and porous, hindering the performance of resulting PDs. Herein, a facile and modified sequential spin-coating method is introduced to prepare high-crystallinity, pinhole-free CsPb2Br5-CsPbBr3 perovskite films with an average grain size of approximate to 1 mu m. The hole-transport-layer-free (HTL-free) PDs based on the CsPb2Br5-CsPbBr3 perovskite films show high performance parameters, including the responsivity of 0.11 A W-1, the detectivity of 1.4 x 10(12) Jones, a linear dynamic range of 128.6, and an on/off ratio of 1.5 x 10(6). The PDs outperform other HTL-free perovskite PDs and are comparable to the p-i-n perovskite PDs reported in the literature. In addition, the high-performance CsPb2Br5-CsPbBr3 PDs are applied in VLC by using the PD as a self-powered signal receiver of voice commands in a simulated room. This work uniquely combines the features of high-performance self-powered perovskite PDs with VLC techniques, paving the path to wide applications of all-inorganic perovskite PDs.

However, the serious interfacial charge recombination and large voltage potential loss in cells circumscribe their performance and commercialization. Herein, a facile approach is demonstrated in which the SnO2 electron transport layer is modified with short-period deep-ultraviolet (DUV) photoactivation process to decrease the work function and achieve better energy alignment with the conduction band of perovskites. Such modification triggers efficient charge transfer and reduces the charge recombination. Moreover, first-principles calculation further demonstrates that DUV-treated SnO2 can strengthen the interface interaction, reduce the interface stress caused by lattice mismatch, induce more ordered perovskite structure, enlarge transfer charge from 0.71 to 2.33 e, gain larger built-in field (from 0.74 to 2.09 eV), lower work function, and smaller conduction band offset. Thus, all-inorganic CsPbI2Br solar cells based on DUV-treated SnO2 exhibit a significant enhancement in power conversion efficiency, and the champion cell achieves an elevated efficiency of 15.1% with a superior V-oc of 1.22 V and better stability.

Cuboctahedral stability in Titanium halide perovskites via machine learning	COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article						Perovskites; Structural formability; Crystal stability; Ionic radius; Statistical analysis; Machine learning	EFFECTIVE IONIC-RADII; SOLAR-CELLS; DEVICE STABILITY; OXIDES	Titanium (Ti)-based halide perovskites with A(2)TiX(6) and ATiX(3) stoichiometry can be promising alternatives to lead-based perovskites due to their high cuboctahedral stability and reduced internal stresses. It is important to study compositional stability and crystal chemistry controlling the formation of BX6 octahedral periodic arrays in Ti-based perovskites. Here, we investigate on the formability of Ti-based mixed organic-inorganic and all-inorganic perovskite crystals via establishing a library of tolerance (t) and octahedral (mu) stability factors using random sampling of ionic radii. Structural mapping and machine learning analysis are performed for twelve Ti-perovskites selected by mixing/matching cations with halide anions. Formation probabilities from normal/binomial distributions are integrated into a statistical algorithm used in a "Decision tree classifier" to obtain training/testing datasets. We relate perovskites stability to cuboctahedral formation considering complex crystal chemistry including ionic radii, bond length from ions electronegativity, and bond-valence sums from coordination numbers. Results revealed that cuboctahedral B-sites should be occupied by Ti cations to have a stable structural composition. High formation tendencies are estimated for methylammonium Ti-based chloride or bromide perovskites. Game theory methods determined six formable structures (Cs2TiX6 and RbTiX3 for X = F-, Cl-, Br-). Probabilities of formation of future datasets with different halides are A(m)TiBr(3m) (0.93) > A(m)TiCl(3m) (0.91) > A(m)TiF(3m) (0.79) > A(m)TiI(3m) (0.52) matching statistical results with +/- 8% marginal error and 96.3% classification accuracy; there is optimality in having a (Ti-Br)-like structure for a balanced cuboctahedral. This work shows a potential towards the discovery of novel lead-free perovskites for photoluminescence, tunable bandgaps, tunneling junctions, and photovoltaic applications.

Rapid, low-temperature, and continuous fabrication processes that can produce high-efficiency PSCs with a reduced fabrication cost and shortened energy payback time are important challenges on the way to commercialization. Herein, we report a reactive ion etching (RIE) method, which is an ultrafast room-temperature technique, to fabricate mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) as an electron transport layer for high-efficiency PSCs. Replacing the conventional high-temperature annealing process by RIE reduces the total processing time for fabricating 20 PSCs by 40%. Additionally, the ME-processed mp-TiO2 exhibits enhanced electron extraction, whereupon the optimized RIE-mp-TiO2-based PSC exhibits a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.60% without J-V hysteresis, when the devices were optimized with a TiCl4 surface treatment process. Finally, a flexible PSC employing RIE-mp-TiO2 is demonstrated with 17.29% PCE. Considering that the ME process has been actively used in the semiconductor industry, including for the fabrication of silicon photovoltaic modules, the process developed in this work could be easily applied toward faster, simpler, and cheaper manufacturing of PSC modules.

Multi-cation perovskites prevent carrier reflection from grain surfaces	NATURE MATERIALS			English	Article; Early Access							SOLAR-CELLS; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; EFFICIENT; LENGTHS; FORMAMIDINIUM; SEGREGATION; STABILITY; TRANSPORT; PHASE	Methylammonium is shown to influence the crystallization process in hybrid lead halide perovskites, leading to a more homogeneous chemical distribution of caesium and formamidinium and improved charge transport between grains in multi-cation systems. The composition of perovskite has been optimized combinatorially such that it often contains six components (A(x)B(y)C(1-x-y)PbX(z)Y(3-z)) in state-of-art perovskite solar cells. Questions remain regarding the precise role of each component, and the lack of a mechanistic explanation limits the practical exploration of the large and growing chemical space. Here, aided by transient photoluminescence microscopy, we find that, in perovskite single crystals, carrier diffusivity is in fact independent of composition. In polycrystalline thin films, the different compositions play a crucial role in carrier diffusion. We report that methylammonium (MA)-based films show a high carrier diffusivity of 0.047 cm(2) s(-1), while MA-free mixed caesium-formamidinium (CsFA) films exhibit an order of magnitude lower diffusivity. Elemental composition studies show that CsFA grains display a graded composition. This curtails electron diffusion in these films, as seen in both vertical carrier transport and surface potential studies. Incorporation of MA leads to a uniform grain core-to-edge composition, giving rise to a diffusivity of 0.034 cm(2) s(-1) in CsMAFA films. A model that invokes competing crystallization processes allows us to account for this finding, and suggests further strategies to achieve homogeneous crystallization for the benefit of perovskite optoelectronics.

J	Wieghold, S; Nienhaus, L				Wieghold, Sarah; Nienhaus, Lea			Precharging Photon Upconversion: Interfacial Interactions in Solution-Processed Perovskite Upconversion Devices	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article							SOLAR-CELL; ANTISOLVENT TREATMENT; PERFORMANCE; SENSITIZATION; MICROMETER; DYNAMICS; LENGTHS	Recent advances in perovskite-sensitized photon upconversion via triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) in rubrene have yielded several unanswered questions about the underlying mechanism and processes occurring at the interface. In particular, the near-infrared perovskite emission is not significantly quenched and a rapid reversible "photobleach" of the upconverted emission can be observed under fairly low excitation densities of 3.2 mW/cm(2). In this contribution, we investigate the perovskite/rubrene interface in more detail and conclude that noncovalent interactions between the organic layer and the perovskite result in surface trap passivation. In addition, band bending results in a space charge region at the perovskite/rubrene interface, which "precharges" the rubrene with holes. Upon initial illumination, electrons can rapidly transfer to the excited triplet state of rubrene, followed by efficient TTA upconversion. As the device is continuously illuminated, the existing holes are consumed and a new equilibrium is reached, resulting in the previously investigated steady-state upconversion efficiency.

The quality of perovskite film is a key factor affecting device efficiency. Lewis bases such as urea, DMSO and thiourea etc. have been applied in perovskite precursor solutions for one step processing to effectively control the film morphology. Herein, we report urea treatment in a two-step processing for obtaining high quality methylammonium lead triiodide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) film, which is accomplished by immersing the PbI2 film into the mixture solution of urea/methylammonium iodide (MAI). The optimized urea concentration in the MAI solution is 0.4 mg/mL, leading to larger-sized and better crystalline perovskite grains than that without urea additive. The main function of the urea additive is the formation of the adduct MAI.PbI2.O=C(NH2)(2), retarding the crystallization process of the perovskite film. The steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements revealed that perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 grown using optimized concentration of urea has prolonged carrier lifetime and reduced carrier recombination. Finally, the carbon-based perovskite solar cells fabricated from the optimal urea concentration of 0.4 mg/mL achieved the enhanced photovoltaic performance with the highest PCE of 13.10% and an average value of 11.34%, in comparison to devices without urea treatment exhibiting an average PCE of only 8.67%.

Influence of Surface Ligands on Energetics at FASnI(3)/C-60 Interfaces and Their Impact on Photovoltaic Performance	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						formamidinium tin iodide; perovskite solar cell; photoelectron spectroscopy; inverse photoelectron spectroscopy; interfacial energetics; surface modification; ion diffusion	PEROVSKITE SOLAR-CELLS; ENERGY-LEVEL ALIGNMENT; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURES; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; CATHODE INTERLAYER; HIGH-EFFICIENCY; MECHANISM; LEAD; PHOTOLUMINESCENCE; IODIDE	Interfacial chemistry and energetics significantly impact the performance of photovoltaic devices. In the case of Pb-containing organic metal halide perovskites, photoelectron spectroscopy has been used to determine the energetic alignment of frontier electronic energy levels at various interfaces present in the photovoltaic device. For the Sn-containing analogues, which are less toxic, no such measurements have been made. Through a combination of ultraviolet, inverse, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS, IPES, and XPS, respectively) measurements taken at varying thickness increments during stepwise deposition of C-60 on FASnI(3), we present the first direct measurements of the frontier electronic energy levels across the FASnI(3)/C-60 interface. The results show band bending in both materials and transport gap widening in FASnI(3) at the interface with C-60. The XPS results show that iodide diffuses into C-60 and results in n-doping of C-60. This iodide diffusion out of FASnI(3) impacts the valence and conduction band energies of FASnI(3) more than the core levels, with the core level shifts displaying a different trend than the valence and conduction bands. Surface treatment of FASnI(3) with carboxylic acids and bulky ammonium substituted surface ligands results in slight alterations in the interfacial energetics, and all surface ligands result in similar or improved PV performance relative to the untreated devices. The greatest PV stability results from treatment with a fluorinated carboxylic acid derivative; however, iodide diffusion is still observed to occur with this surface ligand.

In such setups, interfaces play a crucial role as they can reduce, if not kill, the device performances by bringing additional traps or energy barriers, hindering the extraction of charge carriers from the active layer. Here, we computationally examine a prototype halide perovskite architecture, NiO/MAPbI(3) (MA = CH3NH3+), that has shown excellent photovoltaic performance and, in particular, a large open-circuit voltage. We show that efficient hole collection is achieved only when considering the role of vacancies induced by standard material deposition techniques. Specifically, Ni vacancies lead to nearly perfect valence band energy level alignment between the active layer and the contact material. Finally, we show how Li doping greatly improves the performances of the device and further propose alternative dopants. Our results suggest the high tunability of NiO interfaces for the design of optimized optoelectronic devices far beyond that of halide perovskites.

Chemical doping of halide perovskites is an established strategy to prepare the highest efficiency and most stable perovskite-based solar cells. In this study, we unveil the doping mechanism of halide perovskites using a series of alkaline earth metals. We find that low doping levels enable the incorporation of the dopant within the perovskite lattice, whereas high doping concentrations induce surface segregation. The threshold from low to high doping regime correlates to the size of the doping element. We show that the low doping regime results in a more n-type material, while the high doping regime induces a less n-type doping character.

Compositional engineering of the "A" site cation of the ABX(3) perovskite structure has been shown to be an effective route to improve the stability of PSCs. Here, the effect of size-mismatch-induced lattice distortions on the ion migration energetics and operational stability of PSCs is investigated. It is observed that the size mismatch of the mixed "A" site composition films and devices leads to a steric effect to impede the migration pathways of ions to increase the activation energy of ion migration, which is demonstrated through multiple theoretical and experimental evidence. Consequently, the mixed composition devices exhibit significantly improved thermal stability under continuous heating at 85 degrees C and operational stability under continuous 1 sun illumination, with an extrapolated lifetime of 2011 h, compared to the 222 h of the reference device.

Light Absorption and Recycling in Hybrid Metal Halide Perovskite Photovoltaic Devices	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article; Early Access						light management; photon reabsorption; quantum efficiency; thickness dependence; vapor deposition	SOLAR-CELLS; QUANTUM EFFICIENCY; RECOMBINATION; TRIHALIDE; DYNAMICS; SILICON	The production of highly efficient single- and multijunction metal halide perovskite (MHP) solar cells requires careful optimization of the optical and electrical properties of these devices. Here, precise control of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layers is demonstrated in solar cell devices through the use of dual source coevaporation. Light absorption and device performance are tracked for incorporated MHP films ranging from approximate to 67 nm to approximate to 1.4 mu m thickness and transfer-matrix optical modeling is utilized to quantify optical losses that arise from interference effects. Based on these results, a device with 19.2% steady-state power conversion efficiency is achieved through incorporation of a perovskite film with near-optimum predicted thickness (approximate to 709 nm). Significantly, a clear signature of photon reabsorption is observed in perovskite films that have the same thickness (approximate to 709 nm) as in the optimized device. Despite the positive effect of photon recycling associated with photon reabsorption, devices with thicker (>750 nm) MHP layers exhibit poor performance owing to competing nonradiative charge recombination in a "dead-volume" of MHP. Overall, these findings demonstrate the need for fine control over MHP thickness to achieve the highest efficiency cells, and accurate consideration of photon reabsorption, optical interference, and charge transport properties.

However, electron beam irradiation usually causes damage to these beam-sensitive materials, negatively impacting their device performance, and complicating this interpretation. In this article, the electron microscopy and spectroscopy techniques are reviewed that are crucial for the understanding of the crystallization and microstructure of halide perovskites. In addition, special attention is paid to assessing and mitigating the electron beam-induced damage caused by these techniques. Since the halide perovskites are fragile, a protocol involving delicate control of both electron beam dose and dose rate, coupled with careful data analysis, is key to enable the acquisition of reliable structural and compositional information such as atomic-resolution images, chemical elemental mapping and electron diffraction patterns. Limiting the electron beam dose is critical parameter enabling the characterization of various halide perovskites. Novel methods to unveil the mechanisms of device operation, including charge carrier generation, diffusion, and extraction are presented in scanning electron microscopy studies combined with electron-beam-induced current and cathodoluminescence mapping. Future opportunities for electron-beam-related characterizations of halide perovskites are also discussed.

In this work, we have investigated the stability of perovskite films in terms of morphology, electronic properties and chemical compositions. Specifically, the chemical decomposition inhibition strategy was introduced in perovskite films through iodine bromide to modify the crystal defects, leading to PSCs with suppressed hysteresis effects, superior durability and attractive PCE of 21.5%. Femto-second transient absorption spectra and GIWAXS measurements provide deep insight into the reduced carrier recombination and indicate the improved crystallinity of the modified perovskite films. Furthermore, an efficient hole-transporting material, PDPP4T, without using any doping process is applied to achieve PSCs with enhanced open-circuit voltage and better repeatability. As a consequence, the modified PSCs could maintain 82% of their initial efficiency after 5000 h of storage in ambient conditions and 90% of their initial efficiency after 1000 h of light soaking process. An excellent water resistance up to 100 h of the PSCs is also obtained by encapsulation technology. Besides, after coating Ce3+-CsPbI3 nanocrystals as luminescent down-shifting layers on the front side of the PSCs, the PCE of the device was further improved to 22.16%.

However, the development toward efficient solar cells has been significantly impeded by its intrinsic precursor instability, as well as defective crystal surface. Herein, a strategy for introducing the additive of 1,4,7,10,13,16-hexaoxacyclooctadecane (18C6) in the precursor solution, rendering an excellent stability of more than one month, and the defect passivation effect on the crystal surface are demonstrated. In those perovskite solar cells, a power conversion efficiency of 20.73% has been achieved with a substantially improved open-circuit voltage and fill factor. As evidenced by the density functional theory calculations, the fundamental reason relating to the enhanced performance is found to be the interaction effect between the 18C6 and cations, and in particular the formation of the 18C6/Pb complex. This finding represents an alternative strategy for achieving a stable precursor solution and efficient perovskite solar cells.

However, there are still questions unanswered regarding fundamental mechanisms of high-performance perovskite devices. Hall Effect and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements are conducted in our research to reveal the nature of carrier transport in CH3NH3I3 single crystals. We found that the high mobility of the crystals falls with increasing temperature, while the slow recombination rate constant of the crystals increases with increasing temperature. The former supports that coherent transport takes place in the CH3NH3PbI3 single crystals, whereas the latter evidences that photo-induced minority carriers exhibit their heavy effective mass in the transport. The two apparently distinct features are complementary in the description of the nature of polaronic motions in the CH3NH3PbI3 materials. These dynamical considerations depict a large polaron moving slowly while scattering with phonons in the CH3NH3PbI3 single crystals.

Nevertheless, they are plagued by charge recombination and extraction loss at interfaces between the perovskite absorber and the charge transport layers. Herein, an ultrathin sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) film is introduced between the perovskite absorber and the NiOx hole transport layer (HTL) to reduce interfacial and extraction losses. The modification on the NiOx HTL by SDBS surfactant can effectively tailor the quality of the perovskite film with larger grain size and better crystallinity by regulating the wettability of the NiOx surface with varied concentration of SDBS solution. Moreover, the charge separation and extraction in the perovskite/HTL interface are enhanced after SDBS treatment on NiOx HTL characterized by electrochemical impedance characterization. As a consequence, these benefits contribute to high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.15%, in comparison with PCE of 16.26% for the reference device. It is hoped that this work will provide new perspectives for preparing perovskite solar cells with an unprecedented performance and the opportunity for commercialization.

Supercritical fluid-assisted crystallization of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films	JOURNAL OF SUPERCRITICAL FLUIDS			English	Article						Perovskite; Supercritical carbon dioxide; Crystallization; Cosolvent	SOLAR-CELLS; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; CARBON-DIOXIDE; SOLUBILITY; EFFICIENCY; MORPHOLOGY; TRIHALIDE; ETHANOL; GROWTH; TEMPERATURE	Crystallization of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films was performed in supercritical carbon dioxide with and without organic cosolvents. Post deposition crystallization of the films was performed in a binary, single phase supercritical fluid at constant conditions (45 degrees, 1200 psi) but with varying cosolvent volume fractions up to 2 %. Organic cosolvents with varying polarity, propensity for hydrogen bonding and strength of solvation were used and the resulting perovskite film morphology, crystal structure and optical absorption spectra were measured. It was determined that the cosolvents can provide selective interactions with one or both of the perovskite precursor compounds resulting in different film morphologies ranging from uniform films containing large grains to films exhibiting large cubic or hexagonal crystals or preferential crystallographic orientations. The use of supercritical fluids to enhance or tune crystallization in solid-state thin films could have broad applications toward the realization of high efficiency photovoltaic devices.

WOx is a promising candidate that could truly enable low-temperature (<100 degrees C) processing. However, its amorphous-state form typically obtained with the solution process suffers from high defect density. This causes large charge recombination, and consequently significant deterioration of the solar cell efficiency. Herein, an ultra-low-temperature processed (50 degrees C) nanocrystalline WOx as the electron transport layer, free of this problem, is demonstrated. This material is obtained by the reaction of tungsten chloride with hexanol, which induces transformation of the precursor solution into stable colloidal particles. The best solar cell, with the WOx electron transport layer, achieved an efficiency of 20.77%, which is a record performance for this class of perovskite solar cells.

CsI-Antisolvent Adduct Formation in All-Inorganic Metal Halide Perovskites	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article; Early Access						acid-base complex; adduct; antisolvent; CsPbI3; perovskite; solar cells	SOLAR-CELLS; THIN-FILMS; PHASE; STABILIZATION; CRYSTALLIZATION; COORDINATION; EFFICIENCY; STABILITY; CSPBI3	The excellent optoelectronic properties demonstrated by hybrid organic/inorganic metal halide perovskites are all predicated on precisely controlling the exact nucleation and crystallization dynamics that occur during film formation. In general, high-performance thin films are obtained by a method commonly called solvent engineering (or antisolvent quench) processing. The solvent engineering method removes excess solvent, but importantly leaves behind solvent that forms chemical adducts with the lead-halide precursor salts. These adduct-based precursor phases control nucleation and the growth of the polycrystalline domains. There has not yet been a comprehensive study comparing the various antisolvents used in different perovskite compositions containing cesium. In addition, there have been no reports of solvent engineering for high efficiency in all-inorganic perovskites such as CsPbI3. In this work, inorganic perovskite composition CsPbI3 is specifically targeted and unique adducts formed between CsI and precursor solvents and antisolvents are found that have not been observed for other A-site cation salts. These CsI adducts control nucleation more so than the PbI2-dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) adduct and demonstrate how the A-site plays a significant role in crystallization. The use of methyl acetate (MeOAc) in this solvent engineering approach dictates crystallization through the formation of a CsI-MeOAc adduct and results in solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 14.4%.

Here, an efficient room-temperature conversion route of PbI2 into the alpha-FAPbI(3) perovskite phase without the use of cesium is demonstrated. Using in situ grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D), the conversion behaviors of the PbI2 precursor from its different states are compared. alpha-FAPbI(3) forms spontaneously and efficiently at room temperature from P-2 (ordered solvated polymorphs with DMF) without hexagonal phase formation and leads to complete conversion after thermal annealing. The average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the fabricated solar cells is greatly improved from 16.0(+/- 0.32)% (conversion from annealed PbI2) to 17.23(+/- 0.28)% (from solvated PbI2) with a champion device PCE > 18% due to reduction of carrier recombination rate. This work provides new design rules toward the room-temperature phase transformation and processing of hybrid perovskite films based on FA(+) cation without the need for Cs+ or mixed halide formulation.

In this study, we found that the mechanical stability of F-PSCs is also influenced by the way of mechanical bending. The F-PSCs exhibit better mechanical stability with concave bending as compared with the ones with convex bending. Further study based on J-V characteristics and impedance spectra indicate that the series resistance (R-s) of the device has a larger increase, which results in the degradation of photovoltaic performance after convex bending. Furthermore, it is revealed that the conductivity decrease of perovskite film is responsible for the increased R-s, consequently leads to poorer mechanical stability after convex bending. Our findings may attract the attention of developing the standard of characterizing mechanical stability in the flexible perovskite-based devices.

A careful design and use of inorganic transparent metal oxides with wide band gaps as electron and hole transport layers are critically important for highly efficient and stable 16 (SnO2), which has been frequently utilized in highly efficient OIHP solar 2 solar cells. As one of the most favorable electron transport materials, tin oxide cells, is rarely seen in the application of NFA organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. To appropriately tailor an interface of SnO2 and an organic blend, while to make them compatible and useful may offer some opportunities for achieving higher efficiencies and longer lifetimes. In fact, there is still a lack of a method to solve the problem. Herein, a unique way is developed by implementing a surface decoration nanostructure such as low dimensional MAPbI(3) perovskite nanowires (PeNWs) at the interface of SnO2 and the organic blend such as PBDB-T-SF:IT-4F. Such an interface functions well for the improvement of photovoltaic performance for the organic solar cell of the structure ITO(glass)/SnO2/PeNWs/PBDB-T-SF:IT4F/MoO3/Ag. Experimental results indicate that the electron-hole dissociation, charge extraction, and photo-absorption ability of the organic solar cell can be improved significantly. The inside generation of the photocurrent is explored by the magnetophotocurrent method. Finally, the solar cell exhibits more than 80% power conversion efficiencies even after 20 days, which suggests the merits of having both SnO2 and PeNWs in the NFA-based organic solar cell.

Over the last decade, fundamental understanding of halide perovskites and their impressive performance in optoelectronic devices has been furthered by rigorous research regarding their structural and chemical properties. Herein, studies of perovskites are reviewed that have used X-ray imaging, spectroscopy, and scattering microscopies that have proven valuable tools toward understanding the role of defects, impurities, and processing on perovskite material properties and device performance. Together these microscopic investigations have augmented the understanding of the internal workings of perovskites and have helped to steer the perovskite community toward promising directions. In many ways, X-ray microscopy of perovskites is still in its infancy, which leaves many exciting paths unexplored including new ptychographic, multimodal, in situ, and operando experiments. To explore possibilities, pioneering X-ray microscopy along these lines is briefly highlighted from other semiconductor systems including silicon, CdTe, GaAs, CuInxGa1-xSe2, and organic photovoltaics. An overview is provided on the progress made in utilizing X-ray microscopy for perovskites and present opportunities and challenges for future work.

In this study, three F-substituted benzodithiophene copolymers were introduced in perovskite solar cells as dopant-free efficient HTMs. Among them, perovskite solar cells based on dopant-free PBDT[2F]T achieved a comparable power conversion efficiency (PCE) (17.52%) to that of the well-known p-type doped spiro-OMeTAD (similar to 20.2%). More importantly, the solar cells with pristine PBDT[2F]T HTMs presented impressive stability in contrast to that with doped spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM in ambient atmosphere and even in high humidity. The detailed study showed that the dopant-free PBDT[2F]T HTM presents exceptional ability to extract holes from the perovskite layer, and simultaneously the capability to reduce trap-assisted recombination at the interface of perovskite/PBDT[2F]T. These findings pave the way for the development of dopant-free polymeric HTMs for the fabrication of cost-effective and stable perovskite solar cells.

Here, we report the use of a new class of materials, phosphonium halide salts, i.e. triphenyl(9-ethyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)-phosphonium bromide (TCPBr) and iodide (TCPI), as surface passivation agents for efficient and stable PSCs. Suppressed nonradiative recombination and enhanced interfacial hole extraction, enabled by this facile phosphonium halide passivation, resulted in PSCs with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of >20.1% (similar to 18.5% for pristine MAPbI(3) devices). Phosphonium halide passivation also reduced the hysteresis index from 11.2% (pristine device) to 5.4% (TCPBr passivated device). Moreover, the hydrophobic phosphonium halide passivation layers significantly suppressed moisture penetration and ion migration, greatly enhancing the device stability. It was found that unencapsulated solar cells based on TCPBr treated MAPbI(3) thin layers retained more than 90% of the initial PCEs after more than 1000 hours storage under ambient conditions. Our work established the potential of phosphonium-based materials for surface passivation of metal halide perovskites, providing a new route towards efficient and stable perovskite optoelectronic devices.

Tailoring the surfaces of and interfaces between different materials is one of the surest and best studied paths to enable high-energy-density batteries and high-efficiency solar cells. Metal-halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are one of the most promising photovoltaic materials due to their unprecedented development, with their record power conversion efficiency (PCE) rocketing beyond 25% in less than 10 years. Such progress is achieved largely through the control of crystallinity and surface/interface defects. Rechargeable batteries (RBs) reversibly convert electrical and chemical potential energy through redox reactions at the interfaces between the electrodes and electrolyte. The (electro)chemical and optoelectronic compatibility between active components are essential design considerations to optimize power conversion and energy storage performance. A focused discussion and critical analysis on the formation and functions of the interfaces and interphases of the active materials in these devices is provided, and prospective strategies used to overcome current challenges are described. These strategies revolve around manipulating the chemical compositions, defects, stability, and passivation of the various interfaces of RBs and PSCs.

In this work, we develop a novel method to control the perovskite growth toward better crystallinity and less defects using iodide ions (I-) and thiourea as additives for the first time (we define ITU for I- and thiourea). Grain boundaries in the perovskite films are significantly reduced compared to the traditional method. Moreover, concentration of the defects in perovskite films is decreased by nearly one-half. Based on high-quality films, the PSCs with a champion PCE of 20.39% present a stabilized output efficiency of 19.26% under one sun illumination compared to that of the control devices (17.75%). The devices also exhibit small hysteresis and excellent long-term and light stability. The devices can retain 80% of the initial PCE after 100 h of light soaking or 30 days of aging in ambient atmosphere. This work not only demonstrates a novel approach to passivate the defects by balancing iodide ions but also offers a strategy to control the perovskite film growth, which can be widely used in photoelectric devices.

Solar cell fabrication through low-cost scalable methods, such as blade coating, cannot accommodate anti-solvent dripping and needs to be performed in an ambient atmosphere. Consequently, their efficiency has lagged behind that of spin-cast devices, fabricated in an inert atmosphere and with carefully timed anti-solvent dripping to control nucleation and growth. In this study, we demonstrate formamidinium (FA)-dominated mixed-halide mixed-cation perovskite solar cells fabricated by blade coating in ambient air (T = 23 degrees C and RH approximate to 50%) without the benefits of anti-solvent dripping or a moisture-free environment. We investigated the solidification process during blade coating of single-cation (FAPbI(3)) and increasingly complex mixed-cation mixed-halide (FA(0.8)MA(0.15)Cs(0.05)PbI(2.55)Br(0.45), MA is methylammonium) perovskites in situ using time-resolved grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). We found that the perovskite precursor composition and the blade coating temperature profoundly influence the crystallization mechanism and whether halide segregation occurs or not. The inclusion of Br- suppresses the non-perovskite 2H phase, promoting instead PbI2 together with the intermediate 6H phase and 3C phase of FAPbI(2.55)Br(0.45). Addition of Cs+ suppresses these intermediates and promotes the direct crystallization of the perovskite 3C phase FA(0.8)MA(0.15)Cs(0.05)PbI(2.55)Br(0.45) when coating at elevated temperature, unlike when anti-solvent dripping is used at room temperature. Through control of ink formulation and coating conditions, we demonstrate blade coated perovskite solar cells with a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.20% as compared with FAPbI(3) perovskites, which yield a PCE of 12.35% under similar conditions without the benefit of anti-solvent dripping. This study provides valuable insight into the crystallization pathway of mixed-cation mixed-halide formulations without anti-solvent dripping under high-temperature processing conditions that enable the translation of perovskites toward upscalable ambient manufacturing under high throughput conditions.

H.			In Situ Tin(II) Complex Antisolvent Process Featuring Simultaneous Quasi-Core-Shell Structure and Heterojunction for Improving Efficiency and Stability of Low-Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article; Early Access						grain boundary passivation; mixed Pb-Sn perovskite solar cells; perovskite heterostructures; quasi-core-shell structures	FORMAMIDINIUM TIN IODIDE; FABRICATION; SN; ROUTE; FILM	Unlike Pb-based perovskites, it is still a challenge for realizing the targets of high performance and stability in mixed Pb-Sn perovskite solar cells owing to grain boundary traps and chemical changes in the perovskites. In this work, proposed is the approach of in-situ tin(II) inorganic complex antisolvent process for specifically tuning the perovskite nucleation and crystal growth process. Interestingly, uniquely formed is the quasi-core-shell structure of Pb-Sn perovskite-tin(II) complex as well as heterojunction perovskite structure at the same time for achieving the targets. The core-shell structure of Pb-Sn perovskite crystals covered by a tin(II) complex at the grain boundaries effectively passivates the trap states and suppresses the nonradiative recombination, leading to longer carrier lifetime. Equally important, the perovskite heterostructure is intentionally formed at the perovskite top region for enhancing the carrier extraction. As a result, the mixed Pb-Sn low-bandgap perovskite device achieves a high power conversion efficiency up to 19.03% with fill factor over 0.8, which is among the highest fill factor in high-performance Pb-Sn perovskite solar cells. Remarkably, the device fail time under continuous light illumination is extended by over 18.5-folds from 30 to 560 h, benefitting from the protection of the quasi-core-shell structure.

However, the solar cells to be used for space power have to demonstrate a stable operation under extreme conditions, particularly concerning harsh radiations. In contrast to previously reported superior stability of low PV performance perovskite solar cells against high-energy radiation, we investigate the effects of high-energy electron beam irradiation on the degradation of perovskite solar cells with a high-power conversion efficiency exceeding 20%. We find very high remaining factors of >87.7% in the open-circuit voltage (V-oc) and >93.5% in the fill factor (FF) and a significantly decreased short-circuit current density (J(sc)) after the exposure to high-fluence electron irradiations of 10(15) e/cm(2). The pronounced loss of J(sc) is due to the decreasing transmittance of the soda-lime glass substrate and the partial decomposition of the perovskite absorber layers. The irradiated cells retained superior remaining factors in both V-oc and FF, demonstrating a superior tolerance of perovskite solar cells after the exposure to the electron irradiation. These results show that perovskite solar cells hold great potential for space PV power applications if stable perovskite compositions and space-suitable substrates are employed.

Effect of absorber layer, hole transport layer thicknesses, and its doping density on the performance of perovskite solar cells by device simulation	SOLAR ENERGY			English	Article						Perovskite solar cell; CH3NH3PbI3; Hole transport layer; Thickness; Doping density	HALIDE PEROVSKITES; SPIRO-OMETAD; CONDUCTIVITY; EFFICIENCY; INTERFACE; ELECTRON; DOPANT; LIMIT	Perovskite solar cells are high efficiency solar cells for low-cost electricity production. In this simulation work, methylammonium lead iodide based perovskite solar cells performance as a function of thickness and doping density of perovskite and hole transport layers are reported. Perovskite layer thickness is important for high performing device and there is no advantage of using thinner ( < 200 nm) or thicker ( > 700 nm) film in the device. A trade-off exists between light absorption and carrier extraction. Our result shows that when a thin layer is used, low photocurrent results due to less absorption, however carrier extraction is high. For thick perovskite layer, although more carriers are generated in the device due to an increase in absorption, lower collection efficiency is due to recombination which affects V-oc. An increase in doping density in the perovskite layer enhances device performance due to built-in electric field across the device. Similar to absorber thickness, very thin or thick hole transport layer (HTL) is not suitable for high efficiency. A 100-200 nm HTL is required for less recombination and high fill factor. Doping density variation in HTL shows fill factor increase as the doping density increase, and a concentration of 5 x 10(18)/cm(3) is required for high efficiency. For an optimized device, high efficiency of 28.56% has been obtained with V-oc, J(sc) and fill factor of 1.29 V, 25.40 mA/cm(2) and 0.87 respectively.

The Hall effect measurement performed on Fe3O4 film showing hole-type carriers with a mobility of 0.269 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) confirmed that Fe3O4 could be a potential hole-transporting material (HTM) candidate for perovskite solar cells. This value is higher than the reported one for other inorganic HTMs such as CuSCN (0.01-0.1 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)). The prepared device using Fe3O4 shows a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.42% and long-term durability up to 30 days. This inorganic HTM is introduced as a strong and low-cost substitution to the expensive complex materials in the fabrication of perovskite solar cells. The device is more robust and stable in the moisture atmosphere in comparison to the fabricated devices using Spiro-OMeTAD as an organic HTM.

The first is a full analytical approach to quickly calculate the main features of the perovskite band diagram and easily extract the mobile vacancy concentration from experimental data. The second approach is an online-open-access platform that can be used by anyone to accurately simulate their own band diagram We combine the first approach with current transient measurements to extract the mobile ion concentration for six different perovskite compositions-including perovskite solar cells with power conversion efficiencies exceeding 19%. For the devices measured herein, we obtain ion concentrations in the range 7 x 10(16)-5 x 10(17) cm(-3). We use the second approach to quantitatively discuss the implications of the mobile ion concentrations we measured in terms of device performance and stability.

Methods using high annealing temperatures are not favorable for the scale-up of solution-processed thin-film solar cells, particularly on plastic/flexible substrates. This contribution analyzes the effect of ultrasonic vibrations a recently developed low-cost post-treatment process, on thin-film quality. Ultrasonic vibrations were applied to as-spun CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite thin films prepared with various solvents and antisolvents deposited on substrates with compact and mesoporous textures. Then, mechanisms of solvent evaporation,nucleation, an crystallization of perovskite grains were characterized during ultrasonic vibration. These studies demonstrate that ultrasonic vibration at low temperature facilitates heterogeneous crystallization of perovskite grains with a higher conversion of nuclei into crystal, compared with the conventional annealing process. Topographic scanning electron microscopy images confirm the dense and fully covered thin films after the evaporation of solvent. Furthermore, it is shown that crystal orientation does not change with the choice of solvent, eliminating the effect of solvent on the deposition of thin-film perovskites with this method. Therefore, this ultrasonic vibration post-treatment method is applicable to any solution-processed material and deposition technique, and it can be used to fabricate a range of thin-film devices and printed electronics.

Recently, all-inorganic cesium lead halide (CsPbX3; X = Cl, Br, I) nanocrystals have become attractive light sources due to their high photoluminescence quantum yields, narrow emission linewidths, and emission color tunable over the entire visible region. Their radiative rates are higher (i.e., luminescence lifetimes shorter) than those of more conventional quantum dots, making perovskite NCs brighter emitters, highly attractive as both classical and quantum light sources. Multiple factors-primarily synthesis parameters and postsynthetic experience-govern the observed radiative lifetime and other optical characteristics. High-throughput experimentation in microfluidic platforms equipped with in-line optical characterization had proven to be highly instrumental for rapid and accurate assessment of optical properties, mainly in a steady-state mode. Thus far, in-line measurement of the radiative lifetimes and hence the proper use of high-throughput experimentation for tailored engineering of radiative rates have been elusive. Herein, we showcase a fully automated optofluidic platform that integrates time-correlated single photon counting measurements in droplet-based flow for the rigorous extraction of fluorescence lifetimes of CsPbX3 nanocrystals. The sensitivity of the experimental setup allows for measurements at a single-droplet level. Such concurrent time-resolved photoluminescence allows mapping the parametric space in a time-efficient manner (similar to 1000 lifetime measurements in 5 h of operation) and with high reagent economy (200 nL reaction volume per measurement). We elucidated the effects of composition and ratios of judiciously chosen reagents, as well as temperature on the fluorescence lifetimes (5-42 ns). Specifically, the average lifetime as well as the emission spectra of all halide compositions tested was strongly dependent on Pb-to-Cs variations. Accordingly a correlation between the steady-state luminescence amplitude and fluorescence lifetimes was established, thus providing a simple method to differentiate between the photoluminescence quantum yields, concentration effects, and effects due to the nonradiative recombination at the surface traps. Such a microfluidic tool will aid in analyzing the physicochemical and photophysical properties of diverse perovskite nanocrystals and other luminescent materials produced in the liquid-state synthesis.

Charge Injection from Excited Cs2AgBiBr6 Quantum Dots into Semiconductor Oxides	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							PEROVSKITE SOLAR-CELLS; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; NANOCRYSTALS; PERFORMANCE; DEPOSITION; CRYSTAL; DESIGN	Lead-free double perovskites such as Cs2AgBiBr6 are gaining attention because of their environmental friendliness compared to the lead halide perovskites. In order to establish their photoactivity, we have probed the excited-state behavior of Cs2AgBiBr6 nanocrystals and charge injection from their excited state into different metal oxides (TiO2, ZnO). The electron-transfer rate constants determined from ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy were in the range of 1.2-5.2 x 10(10) s(-1). Under steady-state photolysis (ambient conditions), the electrons injected into TiO2 are scavenged by atmospheric oxygen, leaving behind holes which accumulate within the quantum dots (QDs). These accumulated holes further induce oxidation of QDs, resulting in the overall photodegradation of perovskite films. Annealed films of Cs2AgBiBr6 nanocrystals,	[Cho, Junsang; DuBose, Jeffrey T.; Kamat, Prashant V.] Univ Notre Dame, Radiat Lab, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [DuBose, Jeffrey T.; Kamat, Prashant V.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Chem & Biochem, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Kamat, Prashant V.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA	Kamat, PV (reprint author), Univ Notre Dame, Radiat Lab, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.; Kamat, PV (reprint author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Chem & Biochem, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.; Kamat, PV (reprint author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.	pkamat@nd.edu		DuBose, Jeffrey/0000-0002-7708-4703; Kamat, Prashant/0000-0002-2465-6819	Division of Chemical Sciences, Geosciences, and Biosciences, Office of Basic Energy Sciences of the U.S. Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FC02-04ER15533]	The research described herein is supported by the Division of Chemical Sciences, Geosciences, and Biosciences, Office of Basic Energy Sciences of the U.S. Department of Energy, through award DE-FC02-04ER15533.

They have attracted much attention due to their simple fabrication process and remarkable stability. However, challenges lie in how to achieve complete pore fillings of perovskites in the meso-pores and to obtain high-quality perovskite crystals. Here, we report an in situ crystal transfer (ICT) process based on gas-solid interaction to deposit perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 absorber in the scaffold. CH3NH3PbI3 single crystals are first transformed into a liquid phase via exposure to methylamine gas flow. After complete infiltration into the nano-structured scaffolds, the liquid phase is converted back to the solid phase with reduction of methylamine gas partial pressure, maintaining the high-quality of CH3NH3PbI3 single crystals. Compared with the conventional drop-casting method, the ICT method effectively leads to interconnected morphology and prolongs the charge-carrier lifetime (from similar to 37.52 ns to similar to 110.85 ns) of the perovskite absorber in the scaffold. As a result, the devices can deliver a power conversion efficiency of 15.89%, which is attributed to the suppressed charge recombination and correspondingly enhanced open-circuit voltage of 0.98 V.

These compounds have a set of intriguing optical, excitonic, and charge transport properties, including outstanding photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and tunable optical band gap. However, the necessary inclusion of lead, a toxic element, raises a critical concern for future commercial development. To address the toxicity issue, intense recent research effort has been devoted to developing lead-free halide perovskite (LFHP) NCs. In this Review, we present a comprehensive overview of currently explored LFHP NCs with an emphasis on their crystal structures, synthesis, optical properties, and environmental stabilities (e.g., UV, heat, and moisture resistance). In addition, strategies for enhancing optical properties and stabilities of LFHP NCs as well as the state-of-the-art applications are discussed. With the perspective of their properties and current challenges, we provide an outlook for future directions in this rapidly evolving field to achieve high-quality LFHP NCs for a broader range of fundamental research and practical applications.

Previous search for low-bandgap (1.2 to 1.4 eV) halide perovskites has resulted in several candidates, but all are hybrid organic-inorganic compositions, raising potential concern regarding device stability. Here we show the promise of an inorganic low-bandgap (1.38 eV) CsPb0.6Sn0.4I3 perovskite stabilized via interface functionalization. Device efficiency up to 13.37% is demonstrated. The device shows high operational stability under one-sun-intensity illumination, with T-80 and T-70 lifetimes of 653h and 1045 h, respectively (T-80 and T-70 represent efficiency decays to 80% and 70% of the initial value, respectively), and long-term shelf stability under nitrogen atmosphere. Controlled exposure of the device to ambient atmosphere during a long-term (1000 h) test does not degrade the efficiency. These findings point to a promising direction for achieving low-bandgap perovskite solar cells with high stability.

Despite the fact that CsPbBr3 nanocrystals have been shown to be good scintillators in the indirect conversion mode, the direct X-ray conversion with CsPbBr3 single crystals is expected to yield higher spatial resolution. Here, rubidium (Rb) doping is demonstrated to be an efficient approach to improve carrier transport and X-ray detection performance in the direct-conversion X-ray detectors based on Cs(1-x)RbxPbBr3 single crystals. Electrical properties' characterizations as combined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ()CPS) measurements have revealed that Rb doping in Cs(1-x)RbxPbBr3 single crystals can enhance the atomic interaction and orbital coupling between Pb and Br atoms, leading to an enhancement of carrier transport and X-ray detection performance. X-ray detectors based on a small amount (0.037%) of Rb-doped Cs(1-x)RbxPbBr3 single crystals exhibited a high X-ray sensitivity of 8097 mu C Gy(air)(-1) cm(.)(-2) This work offers a feasible strategy to improve the X-ray detection performance by chemical doping in all-inorganic perovskite X-ray detectors.

Inserting an ultrathin wide-bandgap layer between perovskite and hole transport layers (HTLs) has recently been shown as an effective strategy to enhance device performance. Herein, a small amount of an organic halide salt, N,N'-dimethylethylene-1,2-diammonium iodide, is used to create two-dimensional (2D)-three-dimensional (3D) heterojunctions on MAPbI(3) thin film surfaces by facile solution processing. The formation of an ultrathin wide-band-gap 2D perovskite layer on top of 3D MAPbI(3) changes the morphological and photophysical properties of perovskite thin films, effectively reduces the surface defects, and suppresses the charge recombination in the interfaces between perovskite and HTL. As a result, a power conversion efficiency of similar to 20.2%, with an open-circuit voltage of 1.14 V, a short-circuit current density of 22.57 mA cm(-2), and a fill factor of 0.78, is achieved for PSCs with enhanced stability.

Among light harvesting devices, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been a focus of interest among next-generation photovoltaic (PV) technologies due to their incredible conversion efficiency (certified PCE of 25.2%) along with their lower cost and ease of fabrication. However, the presence of many transport barriers and defect trap states at the interfaces and grain boundaries has negative effects on PSCs; it decreases their efficiency and stability and increases the hysteresis effect. Further controlling the morphology, grain boundary, grain size, charge recombination and density of defect states in the perovskite layer is necessary to enhance its photovoltaic performance and stability. In this review, we summarize the intensive research efforts in aspects of additive engineering in PSCs, including physical and chemical passivation, and the use of a wide variety of organic and inorganic additives to address these issues. Here, we mainly focus on passivation techniques in the perovskite active layer and their effects on the PV performance and stability of PSCs; the grain boundaries and surface defects in the perovskite layer play major roles in the recombination, carrier lifetime and charge transfer of PSCs.

For the first time, intense pulsed light (IPL) is utilized to rapidly fabricate efficient PSCs through swift annealing of both the SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL) and mixed triple cation perovskite thin films. The addition of di-iodomethane (CH2I2) alkyl-halide could enhance the PSC efficiency by retarding the crystallization and improving the surface morphology of the perovskite photoactive film through supplying iodine cleaved by ultraviolet energy during IPL process. The maximum efficiency and fill factor of the PSCs fabricated by IPL annealing were 12.56% and 78.3% for the rigid glass-FTO slides, and 7.6% and 64.75% for flexible PET-ITO substrates when processed in the ambient with relative humidity of 60%, respectively. The annealed materials were characterized through Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV-Vis, photoluminescence (PL), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. In addition, impedance spectroscopy (IS) and current-voltage measurements were conducted to study the functionality of fabricated cells. Our results delineated the feasibility of sequential step IPL annealing on rapid fabrication of efficient PSCs which is directly applicable for scalable roll-to-roll manufacturing.

Charge Compensating Defects in Methylammonium Lead Iodide Perovskite Suppressed by Formamidinium Inclusion	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article							TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE; INTRINSIC DEFECTS; SOLAR-CELLS; THIN-FILMS; PHASE; PHOTOLUMINESCENCE; ENERGY; IDENTIFICATION; HYSTERESIS; BEHAVIOR	Temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy measurements have been performed over a range from 9 K to room temperature on polycrystalline methylammonium (MA)/formamidinium (FA) lead iodide (MA(1-x)FA(x)PbI(3)) perovskite thin films. Our low-temperature PL analysis reveals the existence of charge compensating defects in MAPbI(3), which may explain the lower net free carrier concentration in MAPbI(3) perovskite. More interestingly, we observe the suppression of the PL emission associated with the charged defects by appropriate FA inclusion. Furthermore, FA incorporation into MAPbI(3) has been found to slow the phase transformation of MA(1-x)FA(x)PbI(3) from orthorhombic to tetragonal phase, which occurs with increasing temperature. Our analyses of the FA concentration's impact on defect density and structural phase transformation provide beneficial insights that improve the understanding of the photovoltaic properties and application of organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites.

Despite the great emphasis laid on stability-related investigations, publications lack consistency in experimental procedures and parameters reported. It is therefore challenging to reproduce and compare results and thereby develop a deep understanding of degradation mechanisms. Here, we report a consensus between researchers in the field on procedures for testing perovskite solar cell stability, which are based on the International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability (ISOS) protocols. We propose additional procedures to account for properties specific to PSCs such as ion redistribution under electric fields, reversible degradation and to distinguish ambient-induced degradation from other stress factors. These protocols are not intended as a replacement of the existing qualification standards, but rather they aim to unify the stability assessment and to understand failure modes. Finally, we identify key procedural information which we suggest reporting in publications to improve reproducibility and enable large data set analysis. Reliability of stability data for perovskite solar cells is undermined by a lack of consistency in the test conditions and reporting. This Consensus Statement outlines practices for testing and reporting stability tailoring ISOS protocols for perovskite devices.

Individual Electron and Hole Mobilities in Lead-Halide Perovskites Revealed by Noncontact Methods	ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; CARRIER DYNAMICS; EFFICIENT; TRIHALIDE; SPECTROSCOPY; FILMS	Charge carrier mobilities help determine semiconductor performance in optoelectronic applications, but measurement of the individual electron and hole mobilities usually involves indirect methods or probes with electrical contacts that are influenced by the quality of the interface or contact. Here, a noncontact method is introduced to distinguish the mobilities of electrons and holes by combining time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy (TRTS) and optical transient reflection (TR) spectroscopy. The validation of this method is first demonstrated on a semi-insulator GaAs wafer, and then, three lead-halide perovskite polycrystalline films with different cation mixtures are studied. We find that the hole mobility is significantly higher (similar to 10X) than that of the electron mobility in all of the perovskite thin films studied. The highly alloyed triple cation polycrystalline film shows the highest mobility, longest bulk carrier lifetime, and lowest surface recombination velocity.

How Interplay between Photo and Thermal Activation Dictates Halide Ion Segregation in Mixed Halide Perovskites	ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							PHASE SEGREGATION; SOLAR-CELLS; ANION-EXCHANGE; MIGRATION; IODIDE; QUANTIFICATION; TRANSPORT; IMPACT	The halide ion mobility in mixed halide perovskite exhibits two opposite trends in response to photo and thermal activation. While halides prefer to remain as Br-rich and I-rich domains under steady-state light irradiation of MAPbBr(1.5)I(1.5) films, they prefer to remain in their stable mixed composition when kept in the dark. The activation energies as determined from the temperature-dependent rate constants are E-a forward = 28.9 kJ mol(-1) for photoinduced segregation and E-a,E-reverse = 53.5 kJ mol(-1) for remixing of halides in the dark, respectively. The energy input from photoexcitation assists overcoming the dark (thermally activated) mixing to induce Br-rich and I-rich domains. This segregated state is maintained as long as the mixed halide film is irradiated continuously with visible light. The excitation intensity threshold above which segregation occurs follows a linear temperature dependence, such that phase separation occurs above I-exc = 30 mu W/cm(2) white light at 23 degrees C. The threshold at 90 degrees C becomes higher with a minimum intensity requirement of 100 mu W/cm(2) to induce segregation. The thermodynamic rationale behind this unusual halide mobility under photo and thermal excitation discussed here ca(n) aid in understanding the stability issues of perovskite solar cells.

However, the use of 2D perovskite is associated with a significant decrease in power efficiency resulting from their low photogenerated charge carrier density and poor charge transport. To improve power efficiency in 2D perovskites, highly crystalline films (near-single-crystal quality) of 2D perovskite need to be synthesized where the alignment of the inorganic perovskite components is controlled to have vertical alignment with respect to the contacts to improve charge transport. In this work, we explored strategies to overcome this limitation by integrating 2D perovskite with single-walled carbon nanotubes or graphene to enable more efficient extraction of charge carriers toward electric contacts. Longer carrier lifetimes were achieved after the incorporation of the carbon nanostructures in the films, and at the cell level, power efficiency increased by 2-fold.

However, the efficiency of photovoltaic devices based on PEA 2D perovskites only achieved approximate to 7% for = 3, which was significantly lower than that achieved for other cation-based 2D perovskites. Here, by introducing propyl ammonium (C3A) into the PEA-based 2D perovskites, the device efficiency is improved to approximate to 10% for 1:1 C3A:PEA-based 2D perovskites ( = 3). Further investigation reveals that tuning the CH center dot center dot center dot pi interaction (between C3A and PEA or between two PEA molecules) can have multiple beneficial impacts on such modified 2D perovskites, including a) removal of undesirable n = 1 phase, b) lowering the density of trap states, and c) achieving larger crystalline grains. Additionally, after substitution with 50% C3A, other aromatic ammonium cation-based 2D perovskites ( = 3) also show similar efficiency enhancement in their photovoltaic devices, thus exhibiting the general applicability of this method. The results of this study highlight that the strategic tuning of non-covalent interactions (such as CH center dot center dot center dot pi interaction) is a viable and important method to further develop 2D perovskites for photovoltaics.

Crystallographic orientation and layer impurities in two-dimensional metal halide perovskite thin films	JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY A			English	Review							LIGHT-EMITTING-DIODES; INORGANIC HYBRID PEROVSKITE; SOLAR-CELLS; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; VERTICAL ORIENTATION; LEAD; STABILITY; CRYSTALLIZATION; EFFICIENCY; PHASE	Two-dimensional (2D) metal halide perovskites have achieved similar or even better performance than three-dimensional (3D) perovskites in various optoelectronic device applications. With superior long-term stability, film formation properties, and chemical tunability, 2D perovskites are rising to be a promising alternative to 3D perovskites for research and commercialization. There are unique aspects of 2D perovskites that need to be understood in-depth due to their significant impact on device performance. In particular, understanding the impact of different crystallographic orientations and the presence of different octahedral layer number impurities are critically important. In this review, the authors summarize the formation mechanism of the preferential crystallographic orientation in 2D perovskite thin films and layer impurities, discuss the available strategies to control these aspects for higher device performance in various applications, and propose future research directions that could provide a strategy to rationally improve 2D perovskite-based devices.

J	Wang, K; Zheng, LY; Zhu, T; Liu, L; Becker, ML; Gong, X				Wang, Kai; Zheng, Luyao; Zhu, Tao; Liu, Lei; Becker, Matthew L.; Gong, Xiong			High performance perovskites solar cells by hybrid perovskites co-crystallized with poly(ethylene oxide)	NANO ENERGY			English	Article						Hybrid perovskite; poly(ethylene oxide); Hydrogen bonding; Photocurrent hysteresis; Power conversion efficiency; Stability	ANOMALOUS HYSTERESIS; TRANSPORT; EFFICIENT; RECOMBINATION; STABILITY; SCAFFOLD	Hybrid perovskite materials have emerged as attractive alternatives for cost-effective solar cells in the past ten years. However, achieving hysteresis-free, stable and efficient solution-processed perovskites solar cells has remained as a significant fundamental challenge. In this study, we report a strategy that utilizes poly (ethylene oxide) to sequester the counter ions in the perovskite lattices to suppress the formation of point defects, reduce the migration of ions/vacancy and to facilitate crystal growth in a more thermodynamically preferred orientation. Systematical investigations indicate that poly (ethylene oxide) indeed form hydrogen bonds with perovskite, which reduces the formation of kinetically-driven point defects, minimize charge carrier recombination and sharpen the density of states distribution. As a result, un-encapsulated solution-processed perovskite solar cells exhibit stabilized power conversion efficiency with hysteresis-free characteristics and significantly improved ambient shelf- and thermal-stability at relative high humidity, in comparison to the reference devices that exhibit unstable power conversion efficiency with dramatically higher hysteresis factor and poorer device lifetime. Our studies demonstrate that development of hybrid perovskite materials co-crystallized with polymers is an efficient approach towards high performance perovskite solar cells.

However, surface imperfections of perovskite films impede improvement in device performances, since surface imperfections can introduce undesired energy losses under sunlight illumination. Here, we show that the incorporation of zero-dimensional perovskite quantum dots into three-dimensional perovskite films can heal surface imperfections in perovskite films. Introducing perovskite quantum dots also leads to a more uniform surface topography and potential, along with an improved crystal quality of the triple-cation perovskite films, benefiting charge carrier kinetics between the perovskite films and the charge extraction layers. Ultimately, we achieve a power conversion efficiency exceeding 21% in triple-cation perovskite solar cells.

The photovoltaic market demands high-efficiency, high stability and low-cost fabrication of perovksite solar cells, especially stability to the humid environment for operation. Here, MAPbI(3)/agarose photoactive material for humid stable unencapsulated devices has been proposed. These solar cells have been operated in ambient humid environment without glove box, exhibiting efficiency up to 14.66% and retain 90% of its PCE after 1392 h and 60% of initial PCE after 1972 h in ambient humid environment (RH>70%) without encapsulation. FTIR and XPS measurements reveal two critical factors for the improved stability. The molecular level interactions between agarose and MAPbI(3) passivates the grain boundaries of pemvskite thus preventing its degradation. Moreover, the formation of Li+-agarose complex at the interface between pemvskite layer and hole conductive layer, effectively prevents the water uptake of MAPbI(3) layer. Both effects of passivation and minimization of hygroscopicity of LiTFSI by agarose lower the decomposition speed of perovskite, which obviously increases the power efficiency and stability of device.

J	Yu, HM; Wang, MS; Han, CF; Wang, K; Hu, B				Yu, Haomiao; Wang, Miaosheng; Han, Changfeng; Wang, Kai; Hu, Bin			Mechanically tuning spin-orbit coupling effects in organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites	NANO ENERGY			English	Article						Perovskites; Mechanical bending; Spin-orbit coupling; Defects; Polarization	SOLAR-CELLS; PHOTOVOLTAIC ACTIONS; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; EFFICIENT; POLARIZATION; RECOMBINATION; POLYMER; RASHBA	Organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites have potential applications in flexible electronics based on solution-processing polycrystalline thin-films. This article reports an emerging phenomenon: mechanically tunable spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in flexible perovskite solar cells under elastic bending. Polarization-dependent photocurrent studies show that mechanical bending increases the orbit-orbit interaction, shown as an enhanced SOC, and consequently boosting the intersystem crossing to convert optically generated bright states (which are allowed to recombine) into dark states (which are forbidden to recombine) in flexible perovskite solar cells [PET/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI(3-x)Cl(x)/PCBM/PEI/Ag]. Simultaneously, the photocurrent is increased from 15.39 mA/cm(2) to 22.0 mA/cm(2) by 43% upon such elastic bending with the curvature radius of 4.2 mm. It is further found that introducing mechanical stress leads to both grain boundary interaction and grain deformation shown as the decreased defects at grain boundaries through thermal admittance spectroscopy and the elastic strain verified by X-ray diffraction measurement. The capacitance-frequency characteristics indicate that applying this mechanical stress causes an increase on the bulk polarization by introducing grain boundary interaction and grain deformation. This provides necessary condition to realize mechanically tunable SOC effects in perovskites via electric-magnetic coupling. Essentially, mechanically tunable SOC effects present new mechanisms to control the optoelectronic properties in flexible perovskite electronic devices.

A photo-crosslinkable bis-triarylamine side-chain polymer as a hole-transport material for stable perovskite solar cells	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS			English	Article							LIGHT-EMITTING-DIODES; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; P-TYPE; STABILITY; EFFICIENT; PERFORMANCE; DOPANT; PASSIVATION; CONTACTS; FILMS	A crosslinkable acrylate random copolymer with both hole-transporting bis(triarylamine) and photocrosslinkable cinnamate side chains is compared to the widely used poly(4-butyl-triphenylamine-4 ',4 ''-diyl) (PolyTPD) as a hole-transport material (HTM) in positive-intrinsic-negative (p-i-n) perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The crosslinked films of this HTM exhibit improved wettability by precursor solutions of the perovskite relative to PolyTPD; this facilitates high-quality full film coverage by the subsequently deposited perovskite layer on smooth substrates, which is difficult to achieve with PolyTPD without the use of additional interlayers. PSCs fabricated using undoped and crosslinked copolymer achieve steady-state power outputs that are comparable to those of cells incorporating p-doped PolyTPD (with interlayers) as the HTM. The devices made with this material also exhibited improved initial stability under high-intensity ultraviolet LED irradiation, in comparison to those with the PolyTPD analogue. Remarkably, after 3000 h of aging in an oven at 85 degrees C in a nitrogen-filled glovebox, device efficiency showed no degradation; the SPO was comparable to the initial performance.

A highly efficient perovskite photovoltaic-aqueous Li/Na-ion battery system	ENERGY STORAGE MATERIALS			English	Article						Photovoltaic; Battery; Perovskite solar cell; Aqueous lithium-ion battery; Aqueous sodium-ion battery	SOLAR-CELLS; ANODE MATERIALS; CHARGE-TRANSFER; PERFORMANCE; ENERGY; POWER; ELECTROLYTE; LI; LITI2(PO4)(3); ACTIVATION	Batteries coupled to photovoltaic (PV) modules have been identified as a viable power source for independent "internet of things" portable electronic devices and to reduce the grid load during peak times. However, the poor matching of these systems can adversely affect the power conversion efficiency, safety, and cost due to increased charge control strategies and supporting load management equipment. In this work, we significantly improve the rate performance of the battery electrodes by asphalt-derived carbon coating, and strategically couple high-efficiency n-i-p type perovskite solar cells with either aqueous lithium or sodium (Li/Na)-ion batteries, for the first time, to create a low-cost and high-performance photovoltaic battery system. Both photovoltaic battery systems demonstrate stable cycling performance for at least 30 cycles. We also demonstrate a high energy-conversion and storage efficiency of about 9.3% at a high discharge rate of 2 C and show that this is significantly superior than previously integrated photovoltaic battery systems. We suggest that the enhanced power and efficient energy transfer between the perovskite solar cells and aqueous Li/Na-ion batteries make this system attractive for a wide range of energy needs.

Solvent-free and large area compatible deposition of methylammonium lead bromide perovskite by close space sublimation and its application in PIN diodes	THIN SOLID FILMS			English	Article						Mapbbr3; Perovskites; Solvent free deposition; Close space sublimation	SOLAR-CELLS; SINGLE-CRYSTALS; EFFICIENT; GROWTH; PHOTOLUMINESCENCE; PHOTONS; THIN	In this work, a solvent-free method to deposit in-situ methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr(3)) perovskite thin films is discussed. Spin-coating methods used for hybrid perovskite deposition typically use solvents that might remain in the films after processing, potentially causing accelerated film degradation. Furthermore, spin-coating might not be suitable for applications that require thick films (>500 nm). To address these issues, a close space sublimation process was implemented to deposit solvent-free and in-situ MAPbBr(3) films with variable thicknesses. A post-deposition annealing protocol was developed that results in smooth perovskite films as thick as 3 mu m. Post-deposition anneal also reduces a photoluminescence emission band that originates from surface defects. The resulting films were chemically, optically and structurally studied and hysteresis-free PIN diodes with metal-oxide semiconductors as p and n-type layers were fabricated and analyzed. The results indicate that high quality perovskite films with variable thickness can be obtained by the close space sublimation (CSS) process demonstrated here. Although MAPbBr(3) was selected for this study, this CSS method demonstrated can be easily applied to other hybrid perovskites.	[Higgins, M.; Quevedo-Lopez, M.

Ribbon-like layered crystals of ZrS3 were produced by the chemical vapor transport method and were then exfoliated in three different solvents: dimethylformamide, ethanol, and isopropyl alcohol. The resulting ZrS3 dispersions were compared for stability and the ability to form continuous films on top of the perovskite layer in light-emitting diodes with the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbBr(3)/2D-ZrS3/LiF/Al structure. Film deposition was performed by using either spray or slot-die coating methods. The slot-die coating route proved to produce better and more uniform films with respect to spray coating. We found that the 2D ZrS3 electron injection layer (EIL) stabilized the interface between the perovskite and LiF/Al cathode, reducing the turn-on voltage to 2.8 V and showing a luminance that does not degrade during voltage sweep. On the other hand, ELL-free devices show electroluminescence on the first voltage sweep that reduces almost to zero in the subsequent sweeps. Combining physical device simulation and density functional theory calculation, we are able to explain these results in terms of lowering the electron injection barrier at the cathode.

From the early stage, Ag exhibits a potential to be a good counter electrode in PSCs; however, there is an abnormal s-shaped J-V curve with the Ag electrode, and it is recovered as time passes. The perception of the aging-induced recovery process and refutation of the raised stability issues are required for commercial application of Ag electrodes. Herein, we compared the aging effect of PSCs with Ag and Au electrodes and found that only devices with Ag electrodes have a dramatical aging-induced recovery process. We observed the change of photoelectronic properties only in the devices with Ag electrodes as time passes, which mainly contributes to recovery of the s-shaped J-V curve. We verified the work function change of an aged Ag electrode and its mechanism by photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. By comparing the light stability under 1 sun intensity illumination, we can assure the practical stability of Ag electrodes in case of being encapsulated. This work suggests the profound understanding of the aging-induced recovery process of PSCs and the possibility of commercial application of Ag electrodes.

Vertical Orientated Dion-Jacobson Quasi-2D Perovskite Film with Improved Photovoltaic Performance and Stability	SMALL METHODS			English	Article; Early Access						charge transport; DJ 2D perovskite; solar cells; stability; vertical orientation	SOLAR-CELLS; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; HIGHLY EFFICIENT; CARRIER	Dion-Jacobson (DJ) phase 2D layered perovskites with diammonium organic cations demonstrate improved stability over 3D perovskites under thermal/photo/moisture stresses. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of DJ phase perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) is often limited by the poor charge transport across the perovskite layers due to the crystal growth direction that tends to be parallel to the substrate. Here, a simple and effective method is demonstrated by employing a NH4SCN additive to facilitate the orientation of perovskite crystal growth to be perpendicular to the substrate. Also, the layer number distribution can be narrowed to around n = 3 and n = 4 with NH4SCN addition. The device derived from the quasi-2D DJ (BDA)(MA)(4)Pb5I16 perovskite film processed with NH4SCN shows a PCE of 14.53%, which is among the highest values reported for 2D PVSCs prepared at room temperature. Moreover, the device retains 85% of its initial PCE after 900 h storage in ambient conditions with a humidity level of 50 +/- 5%. These results demonstrate that this attractive approach will enable highly efficient and stable PVSCs to be made for renewable energy applications.

The ionic character of perovskite lattice has enabled molecular defect passivation approaches through interaction between functional groups and defects. However, a lack of in-depth understanding of how the molecular configuration influences the passivation effectiveness is a challenge to rational molecule design. Here, the chemical environment of a functional group that is activated for defect passivation was systematically investigated with theophylline, caffeine, and theobromine. When N-H and C=O were in an optimal configuration in the molecule, hydrogen-bond formation between N-H and I (iodine) assisted the primary C=O binding with the antisite Pb (lead) defect to maximize surface-defect binding. A stabilized power conversion efficiency of 22.6% of photovoltaic device was demonstrated with theophylline treatment.

As perovskite technologies continue to mature, an understanding of their fundamental properties at length scales relevant to their morphology is critical. In this review, an overview is presented of the key insights into perovskite material properties provided by measurement methods based on the atomic force microscopy (AFM). Specifically, the manner in which AFM-based techniques supply valuable information regarding electrical and chemical heterogeneity, ferroelectricity and ferroelasticity, surface passivation and chemical modification, ionic migration, and material/device stability is discussed. Continued advances in perovskite materials will require multimodal approaches and machine learning, where the output of these scanning probe measurements is combined with high spatial resolution structural and chemical information to provide a complete nanoscale description of materials behavior and device performance.

Here, oxygen-bearing Lewis bases are employed as additives to explore their ability to modulate spatial uniformity of crystallization and orientation of crystal phases. Different Lewis bases added into the precursor solutions incorporating the large organic ammonium cation, phenethylammonium (PEA(+)), lead to different crystallization kinetics, which are attributed to the varying stability of intermediate complexes. The microscopic photoluminescence heterogeneity and 2D X-ray diffraction patterns of the thin films reveal that inclusion of Lewis bases can lead to spatially more uniform crystallization and random orientation, resulting in an enhancement in light-emitting diode performance. In contrast, quasi-2D phases formed without Lewis bases show poorer uniformity and preferentially vertical orientation. Comparing the Lewis base properties such as Mayer order unsaturation and polarizability suggests that the ability to weakly coordinate with lead and strongly interact with the large organic ammonium is a key factor in controlling the phase composition favorably toward highly luminescent light-emitting diodes. This work may be of help to provide insight of what kinds of Lewis bases can be helpful to realize the desired phase composition for high performance of optoelectronic applications.

The pressure-induced phase transitions of an MSCMP are identified by the absorption edges of the absorption spectrum and the fluorescence peaks of the PL spectrum. A tetragonal-cubic phase transition is confirmed under a pressure within the range of 0.23 to 0.46 GPa. The optical property of the cubic phase is dominated by the competition between Pb-I bond contraction and PbI6 octahedron tilt up to 2.72 GPa. Furthermore, the MAPbI(3) plate experiences an isostructural cubic phase transition with a unique optical behavior below 3.90 GPa. Little amount of nonradiative high-pressure phase presents a radiative emission mixed with a radiative low-pressure phase, which originates from the diffusion and recombination of excitons within the mixed-phase state. Finally, the reversibility is evaluated by comparing the absorption and PL spectra while the samples are compressed before and after 4.17 and 20.43 GPa, respectively. These results help us to understand the pressure-induced phase transition and the electron-hole recombination mechanism of MAPbI(3) under high pressure in detail. It provides us a new perspective to engineer and optimize the optoelectrical devices of high performance based on organic-inorganic hybrid metal halide perovskite.

However, the perovskites are not stable over prolonged solar illumination. A recent experimental study has revealed light-activated photocurrent degradation and self-healing in lead halide perovskites, which has important implications in tackling the photostability problems of the perovskites. Unfortunately, the physical origin of the experimental observations is unclear. In this work, we propose a first-principles theory that can elucidate all key experimental observations. By focusing on defect-trapped excitons, the theory can rationalize both fast and slow time scales of self-healing, contrasting dynamics of the photocurrent degradation and its recovery, and the steep temperature dependence of the two competing processes. We further predict that the same phenomenon of self-healing could also be observed in other lead halide perovskites with even faster time scales of recovery. The work provides a general framework for elucidating defect-controlled excitation dynamics in perovskites.

However, aiming at the high-efficiency F-PSCs, to get a desired perovskite morphology before and after glass-supportive device transfer is still a challenge. Herein, we thoroughly investigated the effect of adhesive materials of substrates on the perovskite film and the solar cell performance and developed a nondestructive F-PSC transfer method by introducing a double-side tape/protective film/epoxy binder. This nondestructive transfer strategy leads to a uniform morphology of perovskites, even after transfer process, yielding an enhanced PCE up to 16.55%.

They possess unusual bulk thermal transport properties that have been the focus of a number of studies, but there is much less understanding of thermal transport in thin films where a diverse range of structures and morphologies are accessible. Here, we report on the tuning of in-plane thermal conductivity in methylammonium lead iodide thin films by morphological control. Using 3-omega measurements, we find that the room temperature thermal conductivity of thermally evaporated methylammonium lead iodide perovskite films ranges from 0.31 to 0.59 W/(m K). We measure a discontinuity in thermal conductivity at the orthorhombic-tetragonal phase transition and explore this using density functional theory and attributing it to a collapse in the phonon group velocity along the c-axis of the tetragonal crystal. Moreover, we have quantified the thermal boundary resistance (Kapitza resistance) for thermally evaporated films, allowing us to estimate the Kapitza length, which is 36 +/- 2 nm at room temperature and 15 +/- 2 nm at 100 K. Curiously, the Kapitza resistance has a strong temperature dependence which we also explore using density functional theory, with these results suggesting an important role of methylammonium rotational modes in scattering phonons at the crystallite boundaries.

Local Crystal Misorientation Influences Non-radiative Recombination in Halide Perovskites	JOULE			English	Article							CHARGE-CARRIER DYNAMICS; SOLAR-CELL PERFORMANCE; GRAIN-BOUNDARIES; THIN-FILMS; PHOTOLUMINESCENCE; ORIENTATION; DIFFRACTION; TRANSPORT; MICROSTRUCTURE; HETEROGENEITY	We use ultrasensitive electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) to map the local crystal orientations, grains, and grain boundaries in CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPI) perovskite thin films. Although the true grain structure is broadly consistent with the morphology visible in scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the inverse pole figure maps taken with EBSD reveal grain structure and internal misorientation that is otherwise hidden. Local crystal misorientation is consistent with the presence of local strain, which varies from one grain to the next. We acquire co-aligned confocal optical photoluminescence (PL) microscopy images on the same MAPI samples used for EBSD. We correlate optical and EBSD data, showing that PL is anticorrelated with the local grain orientation spread, suggesting that grains with higher degrees of crystalline orientational heterogeneity (local strain) exhibit more non-radiative recombination. We find that larger grains tend to have larger grain orientation spread, consistent with higher degrees of strain and non-radiative recombination.

Here, we report a different strategy of uniformly arranging different-n-value nanoplates (PEA(2)MA(n-1)Pb(n)I(3n+1)) by introducing vacuum poling treatment to enforce nucleation during crystallization. This uniform distribution is verified by delicate mechanical tape-peeling method while monitoring optical absorption, photoluminescence (PL), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). With uniform distribution, efficient carrier transfer within 10 ps is revealed by transient absorption. Moreover, record-high fill factor (FF) of 82.4% with power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.04% (Voc = 1.223 V, Jsc = 17.91 mA/cm(2)) was demonstrated. Superior stability is achieved with retaining 96.1% of initial efficiency after 8-month storage and maintaining 97 7% at 80'C for over 180 h. This uniformly arranging different-n-value nanoplates offers a new material engineering strategy to enhance carrier transfer and extraction for developing high-efficiency and stable quasi-2D perovskite solar cells.

However, the LVAs adopted so far (e.g., phenylethylammonium [PEA] and butylammonium [BA]) are insulating and could impede charge extraction within the perovskite film. Herein, a conjugated LVA, 3-phenyl-2-propen-1-amine (PPA), is introduced in formamidinium tin iodide (FASnI(3)) perovskite. Our results show that the incorporation of PPA results in enlarged grain sizes, reduced trap density, preferential orientation, efficient charge extraction, and enhanced structural stability of FASnI(3) film. These positive effects help in achieving efficient PSCs with a PCE as high as 9.61% with negligible hysteresis and outstanding stability (remains 92% of its initial PCE value after 1,440 h). Furthermore, the presence of PPA enables a self-healing action of PSCs. Most importantly, we report large-area (1 x 1 cm(2)) Sn-based PSCs achieving PCE of 7.08%.

Electrodeposition of crystalline silicon films from silicon dioxide for low-cost photovoltaic applications	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							DIRECT ELECTROLYTIC REDUCTION; ELECTROCHEMICAL REDUCTION; MOLTEN CACL2; DEOXIDATION; PEROVSKITE; JUNCTION; MODULES; SIO2	Crystalline-silicon solar cells have dominated the photovoltaics market for the past several decades. One of the long standing challenges is the large contribution of silicon wafer cost to the overall module cost. Here, we demonstrate a simple process for making high-purity solar-grade silicon films directly from silicon dioxide via a one-step electrodeposition process in molten salt for possible photovoltaic applications. High-purity silicon films can be deposited with tunable film thickness and doping type by varying the electrodeposition conditions. These electrodeposited silicon films show about 40 to 50% of photocurrent density of a commercial silicon wafer by photoelectrochemical measurements and the highest power conversion efficiency is 3.1% as a solar cell. Compared to the conventional manufacturing process for solar grade silicon wafer production, this approach greatly reduces the capital cost and energy consumption, providing a promising strategy for low-cost silicon solar cells production.

In these materials, long-range diffusion of charge carriers allows for most of the photogenerated carriers to contribute to the photovoltaic efficiency. Here, time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) microscopy is used to directly probe ambipolar carrier diffusion and recombination kinetics in hybrid perovskites. This technique is applied to thin films of methylammonium lead tri-iodide (MAPbI(3)) obtained with two different fabrication routes, methylammonium lead tribromide (MAPbBr(3)), and an alloy of formamidinium lead tri-iodide and methylammonium lead bromide FA(0).(85)MA(0.)(15)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)(3). Average diffusion coefficients in the films leading to the highest device efficiencies and longest lifetimes, i.e., in FA(0)(.)(85)MA(0)(.)(15)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)(3) and acetonitrile-processed MAPbI(3), are found to be several orders of magnitude lower than in the other films. Further examination of the time dependence shows strong evidence for nondiffusive transport. In particular, acetonitrile-processed MAPbI(3) shows distinct diffusion regimes on short and long timescales with an effective diffusion constant varying over 2 orders of magnitude. Our results also highlight the fact that increases in carrier lifetime in this class of materials are not necessarily concomitant with increased diffusion lengths and that the PL quantum efficiency under solar cell operating conditions is a greater indication of material, and ultimately device, quality.

Nanosecond, Time-Resolved Shift of the Photoluminescence Spectra of Organic, Lead-Halide Perovskites Reveals Structural Features Resulting from Excess Organic Ammonium Halide	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; DYNAMIC SOLVATION; IONIC LIQUIDS; IODIDE; EFFICIENCY; EVOLUTION; FILMS; TRIHALIDE; KINETICS; TRANSFORMATION	The effort to drive solution-based perovskite solar cells toward higher efficiency has been considerable, reaching over 24%. Such progress has been made possible by the low-energy barrier to crystallization. The low-energy barrier in the reverse direction, however, also renders them susceptible to dissociation from heat, moisture, and photoexcitation. Con- , sequently, studies that provide information on the stability or perovskites are of considerable importance. It has been reported that perovskite crystals formed using different stoichiometries of the organic precursors and metal halide are equivalent. Our findings, however, suggest that the difference in reaction pathways affects the quality of the final crystal and that changes in morphology and the production of any defects can lead to differences in behavior under illumination. Here, we present photoluminescence spectra subsequent to nanosecond photoexcitation of perovskites synthesized under various conditions. Our results indicate that the presence of excess precursors (i.e., CH3NH3X, X = I and surfactant) gives rise to an similar to 20 ns relaxation time with which the photoluminescence spectrum achieves its equilibrium value. This relaxation is absent in bulk, polycrystalline materials. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of the similar to 20 ns relaxation time, which we attribute to cation migration. These structural changes are not detectable subsequent to photoexcitation by X-ray diffraction nor are they detectable by in situ X-ray diffraction during photoexcitation.

Most of QDs have to be prepared in advance and then incorporated into the perovskite hosts, which could not ensure the maintenance of their QD characteristics. In this work, we intelligently developed an in situ preparation strategy to disperse AgI QDs homogeneously in the perovskite host for the MAPbI(3):AgI(QDs) cross-blended layer directly on indium tin oxide (ITO) via a common and convenient spin-coating process. We combine transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman techniques to demonstrate the cross-blended MAPbI(3):AgI(QDs) structure in the final perovskite devices. Furthermore, a series of simply inverted ITO/MAPbI(3):AgI(QDs)/PCBM/Ag devices have been designed and fabricated. The photovoltaic performance of these solar cells shows significantly improved short-circuit current density (J(sc)) and a champion power conversion efficiency of 16.41% even without a hole transport layer. The current technique induced the crystal growth toward high-quality perovskite films with a homogeneous structure, good crystallinity, less grain boundaries and defects, increased optical path length, and uniform thickness for better solar cell performance. Besides, the impact of the current strategy also lies in an accommodation effect of the hole collection at the ITO side induced by AgI QDs, which modifies the Fermi level of perovskite films, leading to significantly decreased level difference in the Fermi level/work function between the perovskite layer and ITO substrates by ultraviolet photoelectron spectra analysis. More importantly, the charge carrier dynamics of such novel MAPbI(3):AgI(QDs) structures were also scrutinized by transient photovoltage analysis.

Elucidating the Role of a Tetrafluoroborate-Based Ionic Liquid at the n-Type Oxide/Perovskite Interface	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						fermi level; ionic liquids; perovskite solar cell; reduced defect density; time-resolved microwave conductivity	PEROVSKITE SOLAR-CELLS; METAL-HALIDE PEROVSKITES; EFFICIENT; VOLTAGE; PHOTOLUMINESCENCE; CRYSTALLIZATION; RECOMBINATION; PERFORMANCE; HYSTERESIS; COLLECTION	Halide perovskites are currently one of the most heavily researched emerging photovoltaic materials. Despite achieving remarkable power conversion efficiencies, perovskite solar cells have not yet achieved their full potential, with the interfaces between the perovskite and the charge-selective layers being where most recombination losses occur. In this study, a fluorinated ionic liquid (IL) is employed to modify the perovskite/SnO2 interface. Using Kelvin probe and photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, it is shown that depositing the perovskite onto an IL-treated substrate results in the crystallization of a perovskite film which has a more n-type character, evidenced by a decrease of the work function and a shift of the Fermi level toward the conduction band. Photoluminescence spectroscopy and time-resolved microwave conductivity are used to investigate the optoelectronic properties of the perovskite grown on neat and IL-modified surfaces and it is found that the modified substrate yields a perovskite film which exhibits an order of magnitude lower trap density than the control. When incorporated into solar cells, this interface modification results in a reduction in the current-voltage hysteresis and an improvement in device performance, with the best performing devices achieving steady-state PCEs exceeding 20%.

Thermal Stability of the Black Perovskite Phase in Cesium Lead Iodide Nanocrystals Under Humid Conditions	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							HALIDE PEROVSKITES; SOLAR-CELLS; PHOTOVOLTAICS; SUPERLATTICE; TRANSITIONS; EFFICIENCY	The equilibrium phase of cesium lead iodide (CsPbI3) at room temperature is yellow and optically inactive due to its indirect band gap. The metastable black phase of CsPbI3 on the other hand exhibits optical properties that are suitable for photovoltaic and light-emitting devices. Here, we examine the stability of the black phase of ligand-stabilized CsPbI3 nanocrystals heated in humid air. Water vapor is known to catalyze the transition of CsPbI3 from the black phase to the yellow phase. Uniform nanocrystals with cube shape were synthesized with capping ligand mixtures of oleylamine and oleic acid or diisooctylphosphinic acid, assembled into superlattices with preferred crystal orientation, and studied using grazing incidence small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering with in situ heating. The black-phase nanocrystals are found to inhabit the gamma-orthorhombic phase and do not revert to the equilibrium yellow delta-orthorhombic phase until reaching a relatively high temperature, between 170 and 200 degrees C, coinciding with superlattice degradation.

However, the toxicity of lead limits their practical applications. Here, the synthesis of Zn2+-alloyed CsZnxPb1-xX3 (up to 15%) NCs is reported to achieve lead-reduced white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs). The incorporation of Zn2+ into CsPbX3 host NCs results in a lattice contraction, without altering the structure and morphology, which has a direct effect on the optical properties. The blue-shifts in the photoluminescence emission and increase in bandgap is observed while retaining high photoluminescence quantum yield. Then by engineering the different compositions of halides for 15% Zn2+-alloyed CsZnxPb1-xX3 NCs, tunable emission (411-636 nm) is obtained. Notably, the WLEDs are experimentally demonstrated employing the lead-reduced NCs (blue, green, yellow, and red). By varying the ratios of the amount of NCs, white lights with a tunable correlated-color temperature (2218-8335 K), an exemplary color-rendering index (up to 93) and high luminous efficacy of radiation (268-318 lm.W-1) are obtained. Best of our knowledge, these are superior to other reported WLEDs based on CsPbX3 NCs doped with transition metal ions. This work places the halide perovskite NCs one-step closer in designing the environmentally benign and energy-efficient WLEDs.	[Thapa, Saroj; Adhikari, Gopi C.

Revealing the Dynamics of Hybrid Metal Halide Perovskite Formation via Multimodal In Situ Probes	ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS			English	Article						annealing time; halide perovskites; multimodal in situ characterization; precursor chemistry; solution processing	SOLAR-CELLS; CRYSTALLIZATION KINETICS; IODIDE PEROVSKITE; EVOLUTION; LIGHT; MORPHOLOGY; EFFICIENCY; CHLORIDE; SCALE; FILMS	The exploration of the synthetic space of halide perovskites hinges on an enormous number of parameters requiring time-consuming experimentation to decouple and optimize. Here, the formation of the prototype material CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI(3)) is investigated at different time and length scales using multimodal in situ measurements to monitor the evolution of crystalline phases, morphology, and photoluminescence as a function of the lead precursors. Kinetically fast formation of crystalline precursor phases already during the spin-coat deposition is observed using lead iodide (PbI2) or lead chloride (PbCl2) routes. These precursor phases most likely template final MAPbI(3) film morphology. In particular, the emergence of the "needle-like" structure is shown to appear before film annealing. In situ photoluminescence measurements suggest nanoscale nucleation followed by rapid nuclei densification and growth. Using this multimodal in situ approach, different formation pathways can be identified either via precursor phases in the PbI2 and PbCl2 routes or direct perovskite formation from molecular building blocks as observed in the lead acetate (PbAc2) route. Correlation of in situ results with photovoltaic device performance demonstrates the power of in situ multimodal techniques, paves the way to a fast screening of synthetic parameters, and ultimately leads to controlled synthetic procedures that yield high-efficiency devices.

Ruthenium pentamethylcyclopentadienyl mesitylene dimer: a sublimable n-dopant and electron buffer layer for efficient n-i-p perovskite solar cells	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							TRANSPORT LAYERS; C-60; DERIVATIVES; REDUCTION; CRYSTAL; IODIDE	Electron-transport materials such as fullerenes are widely used in perovskite solar cells to selectively transfer the photogenerated electrons to the electrodes. In order to minimize losses at the interface between the fullerene and the electrode, it is important to reduce the energy difference between the transport level of the two materials. A common approach to reduce such energy mismatch is to increase the charge carrier density in the semiconductor through doping. A variety of molecular dopants have been reported to reduce (n-dope) fullerenes. However, most of them are either difficult to process or extremely air sensitive, with most n-dopants leading to the formation of undesirable side products. Dimers formed by 19-electron organometallic sandwich compounds combine strong reducing ability, clean reactivity, and moderate air stability, while being processable both from solution and in vacuum. In this work, we have investigated the use of pentamethylcyclopentadienyl mesitylene ruthenium dimer, (RuCp*mes)(2), as a dopant for C-60 in fully vacuum-deposited n-i-p perovskite solar cells. The (RuCp*mes)(2) was either co-evaporated with the fullerene or deposited as a pure thin film on top of the transparent electrode prior to the deposition of the fullerene. It was found that both the co-evaporated blends and the bilayers are effective electron-transport layers, leading to solar cells with efficiencies up to 18%.

In particular, it is important for these systems to simultaneously possess simple structure, self-powered energy supply, and high power density. Using a facile and ultrafast fabrication approach, a highly efficient walking perovskite solar cell is constructed as a prototype actuator with a straightforward design but advanced functions. The device demonstrates a high walking speed of 10 mm min(-1), excellent mechanical strength (the ability to lift an object 15 times its own weight), and high photoelectric efficiency, achieving a power conversion efficiency of 17.75% as a low-temperature flexible solar cell.

Coherent charge-phonon correlations and exciton dynamics in orthorhombic CH3NH3PbI3 measured by ultrafast multi-THz spectroscopy	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							PEROVSKITE SOLAR-CELLS; BINDING-ENERGY; TERAHERTZ SPECTROSCOPY; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; PHASE-TRANSITION; EFFECTIVE MASSES; CARRIERS; PHOTOLUMINESCENCE; METHYLAMMONIUM; CH(3)NH(3)PBL(3)	We use time-resolved multi-terahertz spectroscopy for the range 4-40 meV to probe coherent and incoherent ultrafast charge carrier and exciton dynamics in the low temperature orthorhombic phase of the hybrid metal halide perovskite CH3NH3PbI3. Time- and energy-resolved terahertz reflectivity maps reveal strongly damped but coherent oscillations in the 2-4 THz reststrahlen band, indicating charge coupling to a distribution of low energy phonon modes centered at 0.9 THz (3.7 meV or 30 cm(-1)). First-principles calculations reveal that these modes are entirely of mixed organic/inorganic sublattice character, with the power spectrum of the coherent oscillations showing a high frequency cutoff just at the onset of organic cation-only vibrations. Two anomalous reflectivity signatures are observed which are not phonon related, which we assign to a free exciton at 12 meV appearing on a 0.5 ps time scale and a defect bound exciton at 29-32 meV appearing on slower 1 ps time scale. Our measurements reveal the coherent coupling of charges to low energy vibrations of mixed sublattice character and the presence of two distinct populations of free and bound excitons at low temperatures.

Herein, we report a robust polar-solvent-assisted route to 1D CsPbBr3 nanowires via room temperature supersaturated recrystallization. Notably, compared to CsPbBr3 nanocubes synthesized in the absence of polar solvent acetonitrile (ACN), upon the introduction of a suitable amount of ACN into antisolvent toluene, CsPbBr3 nanowires are rapidly yielded, experiencing a cubic-to-orthorhombic phase transformation and a blue-shifted emission. The formation mechanism of CsPbBr3 nanowires can be qualitatively understood on the basis of the role of ACN as a structure-directing agent. Intriguingly, the addition of ACN renders an accelerated anion-exchange reaction between CsPbBr3 and halide salts (i.e., Br-to-Cl and Br-to-I exchanges) due to improved dissolution of the halide ions in ACN. The polar solvent-directed growth strategy may represent an effective means of expanding the diversity of morphologies accessible to perovskite nanocrystals. As such, it facilitates an investigation into the dimension-dependent optical and optoelectronic properties of perovskite-based nanomaterials and devices. These CsPbBr3 nanowires can be potentially used for nanoscale photonic, electronic, and optoelectronic devices, including photodetectors, light-emitting diodes, lasers, and solar cells.

Ellipsometry is considered the most appropriate technique for fast and accurate thickness measurement for large scale production. However, a precise and well-calibrated model is a prerequisite for this technique. While ellipsometry of individual device layers has been reported in recent perovskite literature, a comprehensive multilayer modeling approach is thus far unavailable. Perovskite optoelectronic devices generally consist of a six-layer film stack with three transparent layers required for optical absorption in the perovskite layer. Spin casted thin films, now common in this line of research, impart their own difficulties into ellipsometric modeling. Roughnesses at each heterointerface, similarities in optical spectra of transparent layers, and anomalous dispersion of perovskite are just a few of such challenges. In this work, we report the process of building an ellipsometry model from scratch for thickness measurement of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI) perovskite and indium tin oxide (ITO)/hole transport layer (HTL) bilayer thin film stacks on a glass substrate. Three promising representatives of HTLs (CuI, Cu2O, and PEDOT:PSS) were studied. The models were extended to measure the individual layer thicknesses of the MAPI/HTL/ITO film stack on a glass substrate using the models developed for individual layers. Optical constants of all the representative thin films were thus extracted for a wide wavelength range (300 nm-900 nm).

Perovskite solar cells with a hybrid electrode structure	AIP ADVANCES			English	Article								Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with a novel hybrid electrode structure, in which a single device can operate with either a vertical (sandwich) or lateral (back-contact) configuration of contacts, are demonstrated in this work. The hybrid structure was achieved by depositing an additional anode on top of a prefabricated back-contact PSC device, giving a final device with three electrodes-one shared cathode and two anodes. Device performances are tested and evaluated for both operation modes, and a semianalytical model along with coupled optoelectronic simulations is used to rationalize the experimental results. It is determined that due to the intrinsically narrow depletion region near the contact interfaces, the charge collection efficiency in the back-contact device structure appears to be significantly lower compared to the sandwich device structure. This finding provides an insight into the cause of the performance disparity between these two architectures.	[Hu, Yinghong; DeLuca, Giovanni; Chesman, Anthony S.

Facile RbBr interface modification improves perovskite solar cell efficiency	MATERIALS TODAY CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Perovskite solar cell; RbBr; Interface modification; Electron transport	LOW-TEMPERATURE; PERFORMANCE; ELECTRON; LAYER; ENHANCEMENT; CH3NH3PBI3; ABSORBER; LENGTHS; GROWTH	High-performance hybrid perovskite solar cell (PSC) is an emerging generation of energy material by virtue of its excellent properties such as wide light absorption range, large electron diffusion length, and small exciting energy. However, to date, methods of perovskite deposition generally do not offer desired film coverage, resulting in the direct interfacial contact, which seriously deteriorates the photovoltaic performance of devices. To improve the interfacial functions of the perovskite layer (PL)/electron transport layer (ETL) of the PSC devices, rubidium bromide (RbBr) is applied as a facile interfacial modifier. It is sandwiched between ETL tin oxide (SnO2) and PL [Cs-0.05(MA(0.17)FA(0.83))(0.95)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)(3)] to a fabricate a planar PSC. The RbBr modification of the PSC fluorine-doped tin oxide/SnO2/(RbBr)/PL/spiro-OMeTAD/Au (2,2',7,7'-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9'-spiro-bifluorene) can reduce the energy barrier at the ETL/PL interface, improve the electronic contact between PL and ETL, and accelerate the electron extraction process. The RbBr modification thus leads to a higher power conversion efficiency of 18.29% for the PSC, as compared with 16.03% without RbBr modification. The facile RbBr modification procedure and significant performance advancement pave the way for future energy studies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, we report a method of fast blading large-area perovskite films at an unprecedented speed of 99 mm/s under ambient conditions by tailoring solvent coordination capability. Combing volatile noncoordinating solvents to Pb2+ and low-volatile, coordinating solvents achieves both fast drying and large perovskite grains at room temperature. The reproducible fabrication yields a certified module efficiency of 16.4%, with an aperture area of 63.7 cm(2). This method can be applied for various perovskite compositions. The perovskite modules also show a small temperature coefficient of -0.13%/degrees C and nearly fully recoverable efficiency after 58 cycles of shading, much better than commercial silicon and thin-film solar modules.

Widely Tunable, Room Temperature, Single-Mode Lasing Operation from Mixed-Halide Perovskite Thin Films	ACS PHOTONICS			English	Article						mixed-halide perovskites; amplified spontaneous emission; distributed feedback lasers	SOLAR-CELLS; LASER; GREEN	Solution-processed organic inorganic hybrid perovskites have recently emerged as promising low-cost materials for optoelectronic applications. However, exposure to light or applied bias causes phase separation of mixed-halide perovskites into iodide-rich domains, resulting in the shift of the bandgap energy toward the infrared for light-emitting devices. Proper selection of self-assembled and bulky organoammonium halide additives, 4-fluorobenzylammonium iodide bromide, FPMAI(1-x)Br(x), to the mixed-halide perovskite system, CsxMA(1-x)Pb[I1-xBrx](3) (0 <= x <= 1), exhibits stronger emission and enables stable and low threshold amplified spontaneous emission, which can be tuned over a wide spectral range. Finally, optically pumped surface-emitting distributed feedback lasers operating in a wide spectral range at room temperature are demonstrated for the first time. The laser emission wavelength can be tuned from green to near-infrared by varying the halide stoichiometry in the mixed-halide perovskites. Ultrasmooth mixed-halide perovskites on fused quartz gratings achieve spatially coherent single-mode laser emission with a pump threshold of 4 mu J/cm(2) and less than 0.65 nm full-width at half maximum.

Herein, we report the crafting of hairy perovskite NCs with a set of markedly improved stabilities by capitalizing on rationally designed star-like molecular bottlebrush trilobes as nano-reactors. An intriguing star-like molecular bottlebrush trilobe, poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)-graft-(poly(acrylic acid) block-partially cross-linked polystyrene (denoted PHEMA-g-(PAA-b-cPS)) is synthesized. Subsequently, it is employed as a polymeric nanoreactor to direct the growth of green-emitting all-inorganic perovskite CsPbBr3 NCs intimately and stably tethered by partially cross-linked PS "hairs" (i.e., cPS-capped CsPbBr3 NCs). The resulting CsPbBr3 NCs exhibit an array of impressive stabilities against UV irradiation, moisture, heat, and water, due to permanently ligated hydrophobic cPS "hairs" on the surface of CsPbBr3 NCs as a result of the original covalent bonding between PAA and cPS blocks. More importantly, cPS-capped CsPbBr3 NCs manifest outstanding stability in various polar organic solvents. Such greatly improved stability can be attributed to the reduced surface defects enabled by the favorable interaction (i.e., coordination interaction and hydrogen bonding) between CsPbBr3 NCs and polar solvents, which dominates over their dissolution by polar solvents. Such exceptional stabilities impart the use of cPS-capped CsPbBr3 NCs as a selective probe for tracing the presence of Cl-/I- in polar organic solvents. The amphiphilic nonlinear block copolymer nanoreactor strategy can afford easy access to stable perovskite NCs of interest with controlled compositions and surface chemistry. They may find applications in solar cells, LEDs, photodetectors, lasers, bioimaging, biosensors, etc.	[Liu, Yijiang; Wang, Zewei; Liang, Shuang; Li, Zili; Zhang, Mingyue; Lin, Zhiqun] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Liu, Yijiang; Li, Huaming] Xiangtan Univ, Minist Educ, Coll Chem, Xiangtan 411105, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yijiang; Li, Huaming] Xiangtan Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Environm Friendly Chem & Applicat, Xiangtan 411105, Hunan, Peoples R China	Lin, ZQ (reprint author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.; Li, HM (reprint author), Xiangtan Univ, Minist Educ, Coll Chem, Xiangtan 411105, Hunan, Peoples R China.; Li, HM (reprint author), Xiangtan Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Environm Friendly Chem & Applicat, Xiangtan 411105, Hunan, Peoples R China.	lihuaming@xtu.edu.cn; zhiqun.lin@mse.gatech.edu		Li, Huaming/0000-0003-4575-9945	American Chemical Society Petroleum Research FundAmerican Chemical Society [57661-ND7]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [NSFC 51603177]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2017M612571]	Acknowledgment is made to the donors of the American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund for partial support of this research (57661-ND7), National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC 51603177), and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2017M612571).		42	1	1	39	39	AMER CHEMICAL SOC	WASHINGTON	1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA	1530-6984	1530-6992		NANO LETT	Nano Lett.

However, this type of materials has so far not been well studied in solar cells. Here, we develop a new hole transport material (HTM), namely S5, based on perylene building block terms, for organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs). We have systematically studied the influences of the film thickness of S5 on their photovoltaic performance, and a low concentration of S5 with a thinner HTM film is favorable for obtaining higher solar cell efficiency. S5 shows excellent energy alignment with perovskite as well as high-quality thin film formation, and the PSCs based on S5 as HTMs show remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.90% with a much higher short-circuit photocurrent than that for conventional HTM spiro-OMeTAD (PCE = 13.01%). We conclude that the superior photocurrent for S5 is mainly attributed to the enhanced interfacial hole transfer kinetics as well as the high hole conductivity. In addition, we have investigated the stability of N-annulated perylene derivative as HTMs in PSCs devices, showing that the unencapsulated devices based on S5 demonstrate outstanding stability by remaining 85% of initial PCEs in ambient condition with a relative humidity of similar to 30-45% for 500 h, while for devices with spiro-OMeTAD the cell efficiency degrade to 57% of initial performance at the same conditions.

In this study, NiO films were grown on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates of different surface roughness by thermally oxidizing Ni film and were tested as a hole transport layer for large-scale perovskite solar cells. Experimental and simulation results show that it is very important to suppress the appearance of the residual stress at the NiO-FTO interface during the oxidation of the Ni film for effective hole extraction. The Ni oxidation on the flat FTO film produced in-plane compressive stress in the NiO film due to the Ni film volume expansion. This led to the formation of defects including small blisters. These residual stress and defects increased leakage current through the NiO film, preventing holes from being selectively collected at the NiO-perovskite interface. However, when Ni was deposited and oxidized on the rough surface, the residual stress of the NiO film was negligible and its inherent high resistance was maintained. Stress-free NiO film is an excellent hole transport layer that stops the photogenerated electrons of the perovskite layer from moving to FTO. The improvements in the structural and electrical qualities of the NiO film by engineering the residual stress reduce the carrier recombination and increase the power conversion efficiency of the perovskite solar cells to 16.37%.

Low temperature formation of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films in supercritical carbon dioxide	JOURNAL OF SUPERCRITICAL FLUIDS			English	Article						Perovskite; Post-treatment; Supercritical carbon dioxide; Crystallization; Grain growth	HIGH-PERFORMANCE; HIGHLY EFFICIENT; SOLAR-CELLS; CRYSTALLIZATION; DEPOSITION; MORPHOLOGY; TRIHALIDE; GRAPHENE	A new method for the production of high-quality CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films at low temperature is reported. It is shown that CO2 above the critical point (31 degrees, 7.38 MPa (1071 psi)) acts as an anti-solvent to perovskite precursors and significantly enhances the solid-state film crystallization rate at low temperatures and also assists in the removal of residual solvent from within the film. Post deposition treatment in supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO(2)) resulted in complete conversion of perovskite compared to incomplete conversion at the same temperatures using thermal annealing alone. Complete crystallization and an average crystal grain size of 408 nm at 45 degrees was observed using scCO(2) treatment compared to incomplete crystal formation with average grain size of 175 nm at 45 degrees with thermal annealing alone.

This ability to design and synthesize engineered OIHP materials has opened the possibility to develop various other optoelectronic applications. In addition to that of photovoltaics, this includes photodetector, laser, light emitting diode, X-ray and gamma detector, photocatalyst, memory, transducer, transistor, and more. At this stage, the emphasis is on fundamental understanding of the underlying physics and chemistry of OIHP materials, which will assist the evaluation of device performance and provide explanations for some of the contradictory results reported in literature. This review discusses the theoretical and experimental analysis of the OIHP materials reported from various sources and considers the chemical and structural origin of their unique optoelectronic properties, correlated microstructures, and newly discovered extraordinary properties. In the first few sections, we summarize and discuss the crystallography, chemical bonding, and substitutional effects, followed by the discussion of correlated photophysics including the optical, electronic, excitonic, charge transport, and ion migration characteristics. Next, we revisit and discuss the in-depth behavior of films with unique defect structure, structural disorder, morphology, and crystallization thermodynamics. Novel thermal-electrical-optical properties including ferroelectricity, hot-carrier contribution, spin-orbit coupling effect, terahertz time response, edge-state discovery, etc., are rationalized considering the results debated in the community. We elaborate on the opportunities and challenges regarding stability, toxicity, and hysteresis. The viewpoint on commercialization of OIHP based solar module is presented with the goal of identifying near term opportunities. Throughout this review, the overarching goal is to provide a simplified explanation for the complex physical effects and mechanisms, underlying interconnections between different mechanisms, uncertainties reported in literature, and recent important theoretical and experimental discoveries.

Here, we use the mixture of n-octyltrimethoxysilane (OTES) and aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTES) to tailor the surface termination state of SnO2 electron transport layer, and demonstrate the crystal grain size of perovskite is remarkably enlarged. The perovskite film with large crystal size shows a lower non-radical recombination density and a longer charge lifetime. The power conversion efficiency of PSCs is eventually improved from 18.21% to 20.3%. The proposed method may also impact other optoelectronic devices based perovskite films.

Compact and amorphous n-type GaN layers were uniformly coated on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates via plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) technology, in which an optimized deposition temperature of 280 degrees C was identified and adopted. The as-prepared GaN thin-films were subsequently employed to fabricate planar PSCs with the device configuration FTO/GaN/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. Interestingly, although a conduction-band-minimum (CBM) mismatch of 0.59 eV is found at the interface of the 50-PEALD-cycle GaN/perovskite, a significantly enhanced device efficiency from 10.38% to 15.18% has also been achieved relative to the ETL-free PSCs. Meanwhile, the current-voltage hysteresis and device stability of GaN-based PSCs can be remarkably improved. It is found that the GaN layer can promote the electron extraction and reduce recombination at the FTO/perovskite interface. This work demonstrates the feasibility and potential of GaN films as ETLs in planar PSCs.

Bulk recrystallization for efficient mixed-cation mixed-halide perovskite solar cells	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							HIGHLY EFFICIENT; PERFORMANCE; CH3NH3PBI3; LOSSES	Today, the use of mixed-cation lead mixed-halide perovskite with a slight excess of lead iodide (PbI2) demonstrates the highest device performances in the literature. However, the presence of excess PbI2 in the film poses long-term stability concerns. Here, we propose a facile bulk recrystallization process by applying formadinium chloride (FACl) on perovskite to remove excess PbI2 in the formed crystal. We are able to demonstrate bulk recrystallization, proved and observed by the Grazing incidence XRD to analyze the crystal structure as a function of depth profiling.

Unlike conventional semiconductors, ion migration in perovskite is a unique phenomenon possibly responsible for long carrier lifetime, current-voltage hysteresis, and low-frequency giant dielectric response. While there are many studies of ion migration in bulk hybrid perovskite, not much is known for its 2D counterparts, especially for ion migration induced by light excitation. Here, we construct an exfoliated 2D perovskite/carbon nanotube (CNT) heterostructure field effect transistor (FET), not only to demonstrate its potential in photomemory applications, but also to study the light induced ion migration mechanisms. We show that the FET I-V characteristic curve can be regulated by light and shows two opposite trends under different CNT oxygen doping conditions. Our temperature-dependent study indicates that the change in the I-V curve is probably caused by ion redistribution in the 2D hybrid perovskite. The first principle calculation shows the reduction of the migration barrier of I vacancy under light excitation. The device simulation shows that the increase of 2D hybrid perovskite dielectric constant (enabled by the increased ion migration) can change the I-V curve in the trends observed experimentally. Finally, the so synthesized FET shows the multilevel photomemory function. Our work shows that not only we could understand the unique ion migration behavior in 2D hybrid perovskite, it might also be used for many future memory function related applications not realizable in traditional semiconductors.

Herein, it is reported that there is a critical amount of residual lead iodide, which is beneficial for the solar cell performance. Transient absorption spectroscopy is used to investigate the charge carrier recombination dynamics in perovskite solar cells and to address the role of different amounts of residual lead iodide. The amount of lead iodide is varied through the perovskite thin film preparation protocol upon a modified two-step fabrication process. Slower carrier dynamics are observed at the perovskite/titanium dioxide interface in the presence of residual lead iodide when exciting the perovskite at the perovskite/titanium interface, which correlates with improved solar cell device performance. Excitation from the perovskite side indicates that the effect of residual lead iodide is primarily at the titanium dioxide interface. Increasing the lead iodide content does not further alter the carrier recombination; on the contrary, it results in lower device performance. This study confirms that the presence of lead iodide can have a beneficial effect, as it reduces charge carrier recombination at the perovskite/titanium dioxide interface.

In this report, we introduce a new synthesis method for RPOLHs with general composition L-2[FAPbI(3)](n-1)PbI4 [L = butylammonium (BA) or benzylammonium (BZA), FA = formamidinium, and n = 1 and 2]. Our method yields polycrystalline materials useful for thin-film fabrication for optoelectronic applications. Furthermore, we report the growth dynamics of BA(2)[FAPbI(3)]PbI4 using in situ small-angle X-ray scattering, revealing that the slabs grow within the first seconds of the reaction and then self-assemble into bulk crystallites.

J	Xiao, MY; Lu, TY; Lin, T; Andre, JS; Chen, Z				Xiao, Minyu; Lu, Tieyi; Lin, Ting; Andre, John S.; Chen, Zhan			Understanding Molecular Structures of Buried Interfaces in Halide Perovskite Photovoltaic Devices Nondestructively with Sub-Monolayer Sensitivity Using Sum Frequency Generation Vibrational Spectroscopy	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Review; Early Access						buried interfaces; molecular structures; perovskite photovoltaics; semiconducting polymers; sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy	SOLAR-CELLS; POLYMER SURFACES; EFFICIENCY; ORIENTATION; SPECTRUM; INTERFERENCE; FORMULAS; METHYL	As performance of halide perovskite devices progresses, the device structure becomes more complex with more layers. Molecular interfacial structures between different layers play an increasingly important role in determining the overall performance in a halide perovskite device. However, current understanding of such interfacial structures at a molecular level nondestructively is limited, partially due to a lack of appropriate analytical tools to probe buried interfacial molecular structures in situ. Here, sum frequency generation (SFG) vibrational spectroscopy, a state-of-the-art nonlinear interface sensitive spectroscopy, is introduced to the halide perovskite research community and is presented as a powerful tool to understand molecule behavior at buried halide perovskite interfaces in situ. It is found that interfacial molecular orientations revealed by SFG can be directly correlated to halide perovskite device performance. Here how SFG can examine molecular structures (e.g., orientations) at the perovskite/hole transporting layer and perovskite/electron transporting layer interfaces is discussed. This will promote the use of SFG to investigate molecular structures of buried interfaces in various halide perovskite materials and devices in situ nondestructively with a sub-monolayer interface sensitivity. Such research will help to elucidate structure-function relationships of buried interfaces, aiding in the rational design/development of halide perovskite materials/devices with improved performance.

Detailed knowledge of carrier recombination mechanisms is essential for understanding their excellent performance and to further increase their efficiency. Obtaining such knowledge is challenging however, and different studies have reached divergent conclusions in some cases. This progress report outlines the critical developments in understanding the carrier recombination mechanisms in halide perovskites from a computational perspective. The primary focus is radiative and Auger recombination, since they have not been systematically assessed and discussed before, and a number of important issues have been actively debated. This comprehensive discussion of the carrier recombination mechanisms is aimed at establishing physically justified insights that can form the basis for better materials and devices design.

The value of these real-time analyses is particularly high for gaining insights into the structural evolution during crystal formation and decomposition upon exposure to external stress factors. This type of analysis reveals the pathways between starting and end points of a process rather than being limited to comparing states before and after the process. Special attention is put on the successful efforts toward upscaling including deposition techniques that are compatible to roll-to-roll processing. These processes are realized using fast annealing procedures. The development of these processes strongly benefited from in situ studies exploring the direct transition from precursor to perovskite without going through observable crystalline intermediate phases. A particular focus of this review is the benefit of using in situ and operando X-ray scattering techniques to better understand and ultimately improve device stability. The difference between structural stability of thin films and structural stability under device operation is highlighted, convincingly demonstrating the indispensability of operando studies.

Here, a record efficiency flexible perovskite solar module is demonstrated by blade coating high-quality perovskite films on flexible Corning Willow Glass using additive engineering. Ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) is added into the perovskite precursor solution to retard the nucleation which prevents voids formation at the interface of perovskite and glass. The addition of NH4Cl also suppresses the formation of PbI2 and reduces the trap density in the perovskite films. The implementation of NH4Cl enables the fabrication of single junction flexible perovskite solar devices with an efficiency of 19.72% on small-area cells and a record aperture efficiency of 15.86% on modules with an area of 42.9 cm(2). This work provides a simple way to scale up high-efficiency flexible perovskite modules for various applications.

The success of silicon has shown that monocrystalline wafers/thin films of semiconducting materials with superior electronic properties are a good platform for optoelectronic and electronic applications. Recently, the newly emerging semiconducting materials of halide perovskites (HPs) have attracted considerable attention owing to their continuing success in high-efficiency solar cells. The demonstrated optoelectronic properties of HPs indicate that it could be a promising alternative to the silicon-based semiconducting industry. However, the prerequisite of high-efficiency devices is the material accessibility of monocrystalline HPs (mono-HPs), as per the lessons learned from monocrystalline silicon. Current HPs-based technologies, in terms of research areas such as solar cells, photodetectors, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), lasers, and transistors, suffer a bottleneck in manufacturing mono-HP wafers/thin-film materials; hence, exciting results involving mono-HP devices are absent. State-of-theart optoelectronic HP-based devices are exclusively built using polycrystalline thin films, which are limited in their performance due to issues such as grain-boundary defects, large trap density, and inhomogeneous charge transport. However, these issues can be resolved by utilizing mono-HPs. In this review, we provide in-depth analyses and discussions on the potential of mono-HPs in photovoltaics and transistor applications, and we present the remaining challenges, as well as promising research strategies, to provide a direction for future programs.

Generally, the precursor films containing zinc acetate dihydrate and a stabilizing ligand monoethanolamine (EA) were annealed to obtain ZnO films. A noteworthy issue is the commonly reported annealing temperature (T-a) in a wide range of 150-600 degrees C. In this work, we investigated the effect of the annealing temperature on the film composition and first confirmed the co-existence of acetate and EA species when Ta is below 380 degrees C. EA still survived within the ZnO films when Ta was between 380 and 450 degrees C. When Ta was over 450 C, pure ZnO films can be obtained. The presence of ligands also remarkably altered the work function of the corresponding ZnO samples, thereby resulting in the remarkably different effects on the efficiency and stability of PSCs with the ZnO samples as ETMs. This work affords a clearer understanding of ZnO films prepared by the SG method at molecular insights, promoting their application in photoelectric fields.

J	Jean, J; Woodhouse, M; Bulovic, V				Jean, Joel; Woodhouse, Michael; Bulovic, Vladimir			Accelerating Photovoltaic Market Entry with Module Replacement	JOULE			English	Article							ENERGY PAYBACK TIME; PEROVSKITE PHOTOVOLTAICS; SOLAR; ECONOMICS; CELLS	Today's approach to deploying solar photovoltaics (PV) implicitly assumes that module technology is fixed. Solar panels are installed and expected to operate for the system life of 30 years or more. However, many PV technologies are improving rapidly along several dimensions, including cost, power conversion efficiency, and reliability. Periodic module replacement or planned repowering takes advantage of this technological improvement and counteracts predictable degradation. Here, we show that a module replacement strategy allows a competitive levelized cost of electricity to be achieved with an initial module lifetime of less than 15 years, assuming backward compatibility with the original system design. We also assess the life-cycle environmental impacts of module replacement and find that all commercial PV technologies offer benefits in the majority of impact categories, regardless of the replacement strategy, compared to today's electric generation mix. Module replacement can thus accelerate the market introduction and decarbonization impact of emerging PV technologies that have achieved a competitive module efficiency (>= 20%), cost (<=$0.30/W), and lifetime (>= 10 years) and have the potential to improve further on all three metrics but lack decades-long field deployment experience.

Here, we develop cryoelectron microscopy (cryoEM) protocols to preserve an extremely sensitive perovskite, methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)) under various operating conditions for atomic-resolution imaging. We discover the precipitation of lead iodide nanoparticles on MAPbI(3) nanowire's surface after short UV illumination and surface roughening after only 10 s exposure to air, while these effects remain undetected in conventional X-ray diffraction. We establish a definition for critical electron dose and find this value for MAPbI(3) at cryogenic condition to be 12 e (-)/angstrom(2) at 1.49 angstrom spatial resolution. Our results highlight the importance of cryo-EM since traditional techniques cannot capture important nanoscale changes in morphology and structure that have important implications for perovskite solar cell stability and performance.

These results demonstrate that if the UV dosage is well managed, UV light is capable of annealing perovskite into high-quality film rather than simply damaging it. Different in principle from other photonic treatment techniques that can heat up and damage underlying films, the UV-LED-annealing method enables layer-specific annealing because LED light source is able to provide a specific UV wavelength for maximum light absorption of target film. Moreover, the layer-specific photonic treatment allows accurate estimation of the crystallization energy required to form perovskite film at device quality level.

To deal with this problem, here in this work, a strategy of in situ surface passivation was proposed and performed on TiO2. After spin-coating Ca(OH)(2) solution on a TiO2 mesoporous scaffold and annealing, the surface layer of the scaffold was converted into CaTiO3, as confirmed by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction studies. The modified TiO2 scaffold was then used as an electron-transport-material in perovskite solar cells. It was observed that after moderate modification, the short-circuit current density increased from 22.32 (+/- 0.25) to 23.19 (+/- 0.28) mA/cm(2), the open-circuit voltage rose from 1.042 (+/- 0.009) to 1.080 (+/- 0.011) V, and the fill factor increased from 63.89 (+/- 1.95)% to 71.37 (+/- 0.43)%, leading to an improvement from 14.92 (+/- 0.36)% to 17.88 (+/- 0.37)% of the power conversion efficiency. Transient photocurrent/photovoltage decay curves and impedance spectroscopy tests showed that moderate modification accelerated charge extraction while it retarded charge recombination. Besides, the in situ CaTiO3 layer prolonged the device stability. After being stored in the dark for 46 days (relative humidity of 30%), 92.6% of the initial efficiency was reserved, compared to that of 68.4% for the control devices. Designated UV irradiation showed that the surface passivation retarded the photocatalysis activity of TiO2, which contributed to the prolonged device stability.

A single step slot-die compatible perovskite ink based on an acetonitrile/methylamine solvent system utilizing a chloride additive is developed, resulting in large area perovskite films from slot-die coating under ambient conditions. The drying conditions for the perovskite film are optimized and fast (<10 min), low temperature (<120 degrees C) drying of slot-die coated films on flexible substrates are demonstrated and result in high performance devices.

However, because of the increase of technological needs, it is essential to identify new functional materials and improve the properties of existing ones. The objective of this Viewpoint is to examine the state of the art of atomic-scale simulative and experimental protocols aimed to the design of novel functional nanostructured materials, and to present new perspectives in the relative fields. This is the result of the debates of Symposium I "Atomic-scale design protocols towards energy, electronic, catalysis, and sensing applications", which took place within the 2018 European Materials Research Society fall meeting.

Recently, the fabrication of nanostructured PbS QD photovoltaic (PV) devices based on zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowire array appears as an effective strategy for improving the overall device performance. Despite its potentially strong impact on the device performance, the role of nanowire areal density on photon absorption and exciton dynamics has not yet been studied and still remains unexplored. Here, for the first time, the areal density of ZnO nanowires is tuned through controlling the precursor concentration and its impact on PbS QD PV performance is studied. It is found that the device with optimized ZnO nanowire areal density yields significantly increased power conversion efficiency (PCE) (10.1% vs 8.5% of control nanowire-based device) due to improved antireflection effect and reduced surface recombination states. To further improve the photovoltaic performance, the ZnO nanowire surface is treated with hydrogen plasma. Transient photovoltage (TPV) measurement reveals that this passivation process noticeably reduces the nonradiative charge recombination yielding a champion device with a remarkable PCE of 10.8%.

Now, a simple yet robust acid-treatment strategy is used to judiciously create an amorphous TiO2 buffer layer intimately situated on the anatase TiO2 surface as an electron-transport layer (ETL) for efficient electron transport. The facile acid treatment is capable of weakening the bonding of zigzag octahedral chains in anatase TiO2, thereby shortening staggered octahedron chains to form an amorphous buffer layer on the anatase TiO2 surface. Such amorphous TiO2-coated ETL possesses an increased electron density owing to the presence of oxygen vacancies, leading to efficient electron transfer from perovskite to TiO2. Compared to pristine TiO2-based devices, the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with acid-treated TiO2 ETL exhibit an enhanced short-circuit current and power conversion efficiency.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to fabricate high-quality FAPbI(3) thin films to surpass the MAPbI(3) based cells due to easily forming unwanted but more stable yellow delta-phase and thus requiring high annealing-temperature for wanted photovoltaic-active black alpha-phase. Herein, we reported a novel low-temperature fabrication of highly crystallized alpha-FAPbI(3) film exhibiting uniaxial-oriented nature with large grain sizes up to 2 mu m. First-principles energetic calculations predicted that this novel deposition should be ascribed to the formation of a high-energy metastable two-dimensional (2D) intermediate of MAFAPbI(3) Cl followed by a spontaneous conversion to alpha-FAPbI(3). The ions exchange reaction during this MAFAPbI(3) Cl-FAPbI(3) conversion account for the perovskite film uniaxial-oriented grown along the (1 1 1) direction.

Unfortunately, the electrical and photoinduced surface and dipolar polarizations caused due to the presence of the organic cation spacer in the structure remain unclear. Herein, a high-performance planar quasi-2D OIHP solar cell comprising (PEA)(2)(MA)(3)Pb4I13 (n = 4) is designed. It displays a large area coverage and an interconnected nanorod network, which contributes to efficient light absorption and charge carrier transport. The surface and dipolar polarizations exhibit remarkable light intensity and electric field-dependent characteristics at short-circuit-current (J(sc)) and steady-state (i.e., V-oc) conditions. More importantly, Voc exhibits a nonlinear behavior at steady states. Such a unique feature is in accordance with the dipolar polarization measured at the same condition. The phenomenon can be explained by the significant dipole-dipole interaction at lower electric field strengths. At higher field strengths, the screen of the dipoles due to charge accumulation at the surface of the organic cation spacer leads to slower increment of Voc. Thus, carefully designing the quasi-2D perovskite nanostructure, together with the dielectric property of the organic cation spacer, may play an exceptionally important role for future high-performance quasi-2D perovskite solar cells.

Buddie			Probing the Degradation Chemistry and Enhanced Stability of 2D Organolead Halide Perovskites	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; MIGRATION; STATE; FILMS	Recent work on quasi-2D Ruddlesden-Popper phase organolead halide perovskites has shown that they possess many interesting optical and physical properties. Most notably, they are significantly more stable when exposed to moisture when compared to the typical 3D perovskite methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI); direct evidence for the chemical source of this stability remains elusive, however. Here, we present a detailed study of the superior moisture stability of a quasi-2D Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite, n-butylammonium methylammonium lead iodide (nBA-MAPI), compared to that of MAPI, and examine a simple, yet efficient, methodology to improve the stability of MAPI devices through the application of a thin layer of nBA-MAPI to the surface. By employing a variety of analytical techniques (photoluminescence, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, cyclic voltammetry, X-ray diffraction) we determine that the improved stability of Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites is a consequence of a unique degradation pathway which produces a passivating surface layer, composed of increasingly stable phases of the 2D perovskite, via disproportionation. Our work establishes that this protective material isolates the bulk of the perovskite from a newly identified hydration layer which is found to accumulate at the C-60/perovskite interface of full devices, slowing further hydrolysis reactions that would damage the device. As MAPI devices degrade quickly without any protection, a surface treatment of nBA-MAPI is an efficient way to delay device deterioration by creating an artificial 2D surface layer that similarly inhibits interaction with the hydration layer.

Nitrides are also significantly underexplored compared to oxides and other chemistries, with many being thermochemically metastable, sparking interest from a basic science point of view. This paper reports on experimental and computational exploration of the Mg-Sb-N material system, featuring both metastable materials and semiconducting properties. Using sputter deposition, we discovered a new Mg2SbN3 nitride with a wurtzite-derived crystal structure and synthesized the antimonide-nitride Mg3SbN with an antiperovskite crystal structure for the first time in thin film form. Theoretical calculations indicate that Mg2SbN3 is metastable and has properties relevant to LEDs and MEMS, whereas Mg3SbN has a large dielectric constant (28 epsilon(0)) and-knalole-effective masses-(0.9m(0)). of interest-for photovoltaic.solar cell absorbers.-The experimental solar-matched 1.3 eV optical absorption onset of the Mg3SbN antiperovskite agrees with the theoretical prediction (1.3 eV direct, 1.1 eV indirect), and with the measurements of room-temperature near-bandgap photoluminescence. These results make an important contribution toward understanding semiconductor properties and chemical trends in the Mg-Sb-N materials system, paving the way to future practical applications of these novel materials.

The Effects of Incident Photon Energy on the Time-Dependent Voltage Response of Lead Halide Perovskites	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; FORCE MICROSCOPY; ION MIGRATION; LIGHT; SEGREGATION; EFFICIENCY; DIFFUSION; TRANSPORT; BEHAVIOR; BROMIDE	Tuning the halide composition in semiconductor perovskite materials is relevant for light-emitting and absorbing applications, as it significantly affects the dynamics of both the optical and electrical properties. Yet, a precise understanding of how the halide species influence the electrical behavior of the perovskite remains vague and speculative. In this work, we elucidate the transient voltage of two purehalide perovskite film compositions (CH3NH3PbBr3 and CH3NH3PbI3) to directly compare the role of the halide in ionic species migration. We capture the photovoltage rise and residual voltage relaxation upon switching the illumination ON and subsequently OFF using Kelvin-probe force microscopy. We discover a unique and unforeseen wavelength-dependent voltage decay for CH3NH3PbBr3. Here, high-energy photons induce a more than 1 order of magnitude slower voltage decline toward equilibrium (i.e., dark conditions) than low-energy photons. Conversely, we find that the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite composition has a wavelength-independent decay rate. The difference in electrical response occurs primarily because of the halide composition, as ion migration rates are reduced with higher Br content. The results detailed here yield new experimental insights about ion/defect activation energies in different perovskite films and devices, underlining a new parameter, photon energy (wavelength), which must be considered when assessing the fundamental photophysics within these materials.

Impact of PbI2 Passivation and Grain Size Engineering in CH3NH3PbI3 Solar Absorbers as Revealed by Carrier-Resolved Photo-Hall Technique	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article; Early Access						charge carrier transport; charge recombination; defect passivation; perovskites; photo-Hall characterization	HALIDE PEROVSKITES; HYBRID PEROVSKITES; HIGHLY EFFICIENT; RECOMBINATION; CELLS; PERFORMANCE; DEFECTS; DEPENDENCE; BOUNDARIES; DIFFUSION	With power conversion efficiencies now exceeding 25%, hybrid perovskite solar cells require deeper understanding of defects and processing to further approach the Shockley-Queisser limit. One approach for processing enhancement and defect reduction involves additive engineering-, e.g., addition of MASCN (MA = methylammonium) and excess PbI2 have been shown to modify film grain structure and improve performance. However, the underlying impact of these additives on transport and recombination properties remains to be fully elucidated. In this study, a newly developed carrier-resolved photo-Hall (CRPH) characterization technique is used that gives access to both majority and minority carrier properties within the same sample and over a wide range of illumination conditions. CRPH measurements on n-type MAPbI(3) films reveal an order of magnitude increase in carrier recombination lifetime and electron density for 5% excess PbI2 added to the precursor solution, with little change noted in electron and hole mobility values. Grain size variation (120-2100 nm) and MASCN addition induce no significant change in carrier-related parameters considered, highlighting the benign nature of the grain boundaries and that excess PbI2 must predominantly passivate bulk defects rather than defects situated at grain boundaries. This study offers a unique picture of additive impact on MAPbI(3) optoelectronic properties as elucidated by the new CRPH approach.

The introduction of a small amount of hydrophobic cations of large size into a 3D perovskite structure which typically aids in the formation of a quasi-2D perovskite structure has been shown to be a promising method for maintaining high efficiency while introducing a high stability toward moisture. By comparing a family of different cations, the propylammonium (PA) cation is found to be the most effective in mitigating these instability issues. Via femtosecond transient absorption and reflection spectroscopy, the large cations are found to preferentially accumulate at the grain boundaries and film surface, forming heterostructures and preventing moisture penetration. The preferential crystal orientation, crystallization, and grain size in both lateral and vertical directions are enhanced accordingly, in particular when PA is incorporated into the perovskite active layer. Such self-assembled large cations suppress charge recombination and enhance device efficiency. Along with enhancements to efficiency, the addition of the PA cation significantly improves both device and precursor stabilities.

The example of Bi impurities introducing efficient recombination centers	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							OPEN-CIRCUIT VOLTAGE; HOLE-TRANSPORT LAYERS; P-I-N; SOLAR-CELLS; CH3NH3PBI3 PEROVSKITE; GRAIN-BOUNDARIES; HIGHLY EFFICIENT; IODIDE; LIFETIMES; EVOLUTION	One of the key properties of lead-halide perovskites employed in solar cells is the defect tolerance of the materials, in particular regarding intrinsic point defects, which mainly form shallow traps. Considering that high luminescence yields and photovoltaic performance are obtained by simple solution processing from commercial chemicals, it is commonly anticipated that the defect tolerance - at least to a considerable degree - extends to grain boundaries and extrinsic defects, i.e. impurities, as well. However, the effect of impurities has hardly been investigated. Here, we intentionally introduce small quantities of bismuth (10 ppm to 2%) in solution to be incorporated in the perovskite films based on mixed cation mixed anion compositions. We observe that Bi impurities in the %-regime reduce charge carrier collection efficiency and, more importantly, that the open-circuit voltage decreases systematically with impurity concentration even in the ppm regime. This strong defect intolerance against Bi impurities comes along with reduced electroluminescence yields and charge carrier lifetimes obtained from transient photoluminescence experiments. Calculations based on molecular dynamics and density functional theory predict delocalized (approximate to 0.16 eV) and localized deep (approximate to 0.51 eV) trap states dependent on the structural arrangement of the surrounding atoms. Structural characterization supports the idea of Bi being present as a homogeneously spread point defect, which substitutes the Pb2+ by Bi3+ as seen from XPS and a reduction of the lattice parameter in XRD. Sensitive measurements of the photocurrent (by FTPS) and surface photovoltage (SPV) confirm the presence of tail states. Photoelectron spectroscopy measurements show evidence of a deep state. These results are consistent with the common idea of shallow traps being responsible for the reduced charge collection efficiency and the decreased fill factor, and deeper traps causing a substantial reduction of the open-circuit voltage.

However, its hygroscopic nature has prompted the quest for water-resistant alternatives. Recent studies have suggested that mixing MAPI with lower dimensional, bulky-A-site-cation perovskites helps mitigate this environmental instability. On the other hand, low dimensional perovskites suffer from poor device performance, which has been suggested to be due to limited out-of-plane charge carrier mobility resulting from structural dimensionality and large binding energy of the charge carriers. To understand the effects of dimensionality on performance, we systematically mixed MA-based 3D perovskites with larger A-site cations to produce dimethylammonium, iso-propylammonium, and t-butylammonium lead iodide perovskites. During the shift from MAPI to lower dimensional (LD) PSCs, the efficiency is significantly reduced by 2 orders of magnitude, with short-circuit current densities decreasing from above 20 mA cm(-2) to less than 1 mA cm(-2). In order to explain this decrease in performance, we studied the charge carrier mobilities of these materials using optical-pump/terahertz-probe, time-resolved microwave photoconductivity, and photoluminescence measurements. The results show that as we add more of the low dimensional perovskites, the mobility decreases, up to a factor of 20 when it reaches pure LD perovskites. In addition, the photoluminescence decay fitting is slightly slower for the mixed perovskites, suggesting some improvement in the recombination dynamics. These findings indicate that changes in structural dimensionality brought about by mixing A-site cations play an important role in determining the measured charge carrier mobility, and in the performance of perovskite solar cells.

Photo-annealing is a low-cost, roll-to-roll-compatible process that can be applied to the post-treatment fabrication of sol-gel based metal oxide layers. Here, we fabricate an amorphous titanium oxide electron selective layer at a low temperature in a dry atmosphere using a UV light annealing system and compare it with a thermal annealing process. Active oxygen species are created by using UV light to promote hydrolysis and condense the TiO2 precursor, which removes organic ligands effectively. The photo-annealed TiO2-based perovskite solar cell has a power conversion efficiency of 19.37% without hysteresis.

Herein, for the first time, an efficient model of a hole transport material (HTM) is demonstrated by optimized doping of a conjugated polymer TFB (poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-co-(4,4'-(N-(4-sec-butylphenyl)diphenylamine)]) with a non-hygroscopic p-type dopant F4-TCNQ (2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane) for high-efficiency PSCs. The PSC with the F4-TCNQ doped TFB exhibits the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.46%, which surpasses that of the reference devices, i.e., 16.64 (LiTFSI + TBP-doped Spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM) and 11.01% (LiTFSI + TBP-doped TFB as the HTM). F4-TCNQ doped TFB was believed to favor efficient charge and energy transfer between the perovskite and the hole transport layer and to reduce charge recombination as evidenced by steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) analysis. Moreover, the hydrophobic nature of F4-TCNQ contributed to enhancing the stability of the device under ambient conditions with a RH of 45%. The device reported herein retained ca. 80% of its initial efficiency after 10 days, significantly superior to both LiTFSI + TBP-doped Spiro-OMeTAD (ca. 30%) and LiTFSI + TBP-doped TFB (ca. 10%) based counterparts. This simple yet novel strategy paves the way for demonstrating a promising route for a wide range of highly efficient solar cells and other photovoltaic applications.

Enhanced Nucleation of Atomic Layer Deposited Contacts Improves Operational Stability of Perovskite Solar Cells in Air	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article; Early Access						atomic layer deposition; barrier layer; nucleation; perovskite solar cells; stability testing	WORK FUNCTION; INDUCED DEGRADATION; AL2O3; EFFICIENCY; RESISTANCE; CATION; OXIDE	Metal-halide perovskites show promise as highly efficient solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and other optoelectronic devices. Ensuring long-term stability is now a major priority. In this study, an ultrathin (2 nm) layer of polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE) is used to functionalize the surface of C-60 for the subsequent deposition of atomic layer deposition (ALD) SnO2, a commonly used electron contact bilayer for p-i-n devices. The enhanced nucleation results in a more continuous initial ALD SnO2 layer that exhibits superior barrier properties, protecting Cs(0.25)FA(0.75)Pb(Br0.20I0.80)(3) films upon direct exposure to high temperatures (200 degrees C) and water. This surface modification with PEIE translates to more stable solar cells under aggressive testing conditions in air at 60 degrees C under illumination. This type of "built-in" barrier layer mitigates degradation pathways not addressed by external encapsulation, such as internal halide or metal diffusion, while maintaining high device efficiency up to 18.5%. This nucleation strategy is also extended to ALD VOx films, demonstrating its potential to be broadly applied to other metal oxide contacts and device architectures.

However, most perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) employ thermally deposited charge transport layers (CTLs) on top of perovskite layers. In order to realize low-cost and scalable fabrication of PeLEDs, all-solution process is highly desired, but still remaining great challenges. Here, an efficient all-solution-processed green PeLEDs is reported by incorporating 1,3,5-tris(1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)benzene (TPBi) doped conjugated amino-alkyl substituted polyfluorene poly[(9,9-bis(3 '-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) electron injection layer, achieving a maximum luminance of 9875 cd m(-2), a high current efficiency of 10.41 cd A(-1), and an external quantum efficiency of 3.19%. Since the solvents used for perovskite precursors and PFN are orthogonal, the protected and complete interface of perovskite film and CTL is effectively obtained by solution processes. The doping of TPBi into PFN not only enhances the capability of electron injection, but also significantly suppresses the emission quenching of perovskite films caused by the charge transfer between perovskite and PFN due to the reduced difference in their work functions. This work provides an efficient approach for the development of all-solution-processed PeLEDs.

Here, a novel electron transport material was designed and synthesized by using a simple and facile solvothermal method, which is composed of the core-shell ZnO@SnO2 nanoparticles. Thanks to the good match between the energy level of the SnO2 shell and the high electron mobility of the core ZnO nanoparticles, the PCE of inorganic perovskite solar cells has reached 14.35% (J(SC): 16.45 mA cm(-2), V-OC: 1.11 V, FF: 79%), acting core-shell ZnO@SnO2 nanoparticles as the electron transfer layer. The core-shell ZnO@SnO2 nanoparticles size is 8.1 nm with the SnO2 shell thickness of 3.4 nm, and the electron mobility is seven times more than SnO2 nanoparticles. Meanwhile, the uniform core-shell ZnO@SnO2 nanoparticles is extremely favorable to the growth of inorganic perovskite films. These preliminary results strongly suggest the great potential of this novel electron transfer material in high-efficiency perovskite solar cells.

Spatially Resolved Carrier Dynamics at MAPbBr(3) Single Crystal-Electrode Interface	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						hybrid perovskite; charge transport; interface; electric field; Kelvin probe force microscopy	PROBE FORCE MICROSCOPY; METHYLAMMONIUM-LEAD IODIDE; METAL-HALIDE PEROVSKITES; POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION; ANOMALOUS HYSTERESIS; MIGRATION; TRANSPORT; DEGRADATION; DEFECTS; BARRIER	Despite the rapid progress in organic inorganic halide perovskites (OIHPs) for applications such as solar cells and detectors, knowledge of coupling between electronic and ionic charge carrier dynamics is so far limited. While the presence of dual-conduction channels is widely accepted, the precise physical mechanisms governing the impact of electronic (e.g. electrons and holes) and ionic conduction, especially interface phenomena, remain uncertain. The lack of understanding stems largely from the lack of appropriate tools to capture the electrochemical dynamics on the length scales of the local inhomogeneities present (e.g., interfaces, grain boundaries, space charge regions) and time scales over which the coupled dynamics take place. Here, we implement Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) to explore the charge carrier dynamics at the methylammonium lead tribromide (MAPbBr(3)) single crystal-gold electrode interface. In this work, the temporal dynamics of the electric field and charge carrier distribution at the electrode interface is spatially visualized by time-resolved KPFM mapping. The results demonstrate an interplay of several phenomena, including charge injection, recombination, and ion migration, leading to an unbalanced charge dynamic at MAPbBr(3) single crystal-electrode interface under forward and reverse bias conditions explaining the origin of the current-voltage hysteresis in these devices. We contrast the bias-assisted charge dynamics under both illuminated and dark conditions, providing a comprehensive picture of overall carrier dynamics and interface properties in a MAPbBr(3) single crystal with lateral symmetric Au electrodes. Remarkably, illumination leads to the formation of a wider space charge region due to accumulation of negative charges (both electrons and halide ions) at the positive electrode, which can effectively screen the external electric field leading to lower charge extraction efficiency. The results suggest that the choice of contact or interfacial engineering can control the performance of OIHP devices without requiring modification of the material's bulk properties.

However, the present synthesis of PbS QDs cannot produce highly efficient infrared solar cells. Here, a general synthesis is developed for low-bandgap PbS QDs (0.65-1 eV) via cation exchange from ZnS nanorods (NRs). First, ZnS NRs are converted to superlattices with segregated PbS domains within each rod. Then, sulfur precursors are released via the dissolution of the ZnS NRs during the cation exchange, which promotes size focusing of PbS QDs. PbS QDs synthesized through this new method have the advantages of high monodispersity, ease-of-size control, in situ passivation of chloride, high stability, and a "clean" surface. Infrared solar cells based on these PbS QDs with different bandgaps are fabricated, using conventional ligand exchange and device structure. All of the devices produced in this manner show excellent performance, showcasing the high quality of the PbS QDs. The highest performance of infrared solar cells is achieved using approximate to 0.95 eV PbS QDs, exhibiting an efficiency of 10.0% under AM 1.5 solar illumination, a perovskite-filtered efficiency of 4.2%, and a silicon-filtered efficiency of 1.1%.

However, in general they exhibit low power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) because of the existence of defects. A new all-inorganic perovskite material, CsPbI3:Br:InI3, is prepared by defect engineering of CsPbI3. This new perovskite retains the same bandgap as CsPbI3, while the intrinsic defect concentration is largely suppressed. Moreover, it can be prepared in an extremely high humidity atmosphere and thus a glovebox is not required. By completely eliminating the labile and expensive components in traditional PSCs, the all-inorganic PSCs based on CsPbI3:Br:InI3 and carbon electrode exhibit PCE and open-circuit voltage as high as 12.04% and 1.20 V, respectively. More importantly, they demonstrate excellent stability in air for more than two months, while those based on CsPbI3 can survive only a few days in air. The progress reported represents a major leap for all-inorganic PSCs and paves the way for their further exploration in order to achieve higher performance.

To address this issue, extensive research efforts are dedicated to exploiting all-inorganic PVSCs by using cesium (Cs)-based perovskite materials, such as alpha-CsPbI3. However, the black-phase CsPbI3 (cubic alpha-CsPbI3 and orthorhombic gamma-CsPbI3 phases) is not stable at room temperature, and it tends to convert to the nonperovskite delta-CsPbI3 phase. Here, a simple yet effective approach is described to prepare stable black-phase CsPbI3 by forming a heterostructure comprising 0D Cs4PbI6 and gamma-CsPbI3 through tuning the stoichiometry of the precursors between CsI and PbI. Such heterostructure is manifested to enable the realization of a stable all-inorganic PVSC with a high power conversion efficiency of 16.39%. This work provides a new perspective for developing high-performance and stable all-inorganic PVSCs.

Despite the tremendous efforts of scientists, the progress of integration of a phototransistor, where the built-in electric field separates the photogenerated excitons, and a light-emitting diode, where the radiative recombination can be enhanced by band offset, into a single device remains a challenge. Combining the superior properties of perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) and graphene, here we report a light-emissive, ultrasensitive, ultrafast, and broadband vertical phototransistor that can simultaneously act as an efficient photodetector and light emitter within a single device. The estimated value of the external quantum efficiency of the vertical phototransistor is similar to 1.2 X 10(10)% with a photoresponsivity of >10(9) A W-1 and a response time of <50 mu s, which exceed all the presently reported vertical phototransistor devices. We also demonstrate that the modulation of the Dirac point of graphene efficiently tunes both amplitude and polarity of the photocurrent.

Lead halide perovskites are an emerging class of semiconducting materials that can be patterned via solution-based methods. Here we report an all-benchtop patterning strategy by first generating a patterned surface with contrasting wettabilities to organic solvents that have been used in the perovskite precursor solution and then spin-coating the solution onto the patterned surface. The precursor solution only stays in the area with higher affinity (wettability). We applied sequential sunlight-initiated thiol-ene reactions to functionalize (and pattern) both glass and conductive fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) transparent glass surfaces. The functionalized surfaces were measured with the solvent contact angles of water and different organic solvents and were further characterized by XPS, selective fluorescence staining, and selective DNA adsorption. By simply spin-coating and baking the perovskite precursor solution on the patterned substrates, we obtained perovskite thin-film microarrays. The spin-coated perovskite arrays were characterized by XRD, AFM, and SEM. We concluded that patterned substrate prepared via sequential sunlight-initiated thiol-ene click reactions is suitable to fabricate perovskite arrays via the benchtop process. In addition, the same patterned substrates can be reused several times until a favorable perovskite microarray is acquired. Among a few conditions we have tested, DMSO solvent and modified FTO surfaces with alternatively carboxylic acid and alkane is the best combination to obtain high-quality perovskite microarrays. The solvent contact angle of DMSO on carboxylic acid-modified FTO surface is nearly zero and 65 +/- 3 degrees on an octadecane-modified FTO surface.	[Piecco, Kurt Waldo E.

Tuning, optimization, and perovskite solar cell device integration of ultrathin poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) films via a single-step all-dry process	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							CHEMICAL-VAPOR-DEPOSITION; THIN-FILMS; CHARGE-TRANSPORT; POLYMER; OCVD; GENERATION; CONDUCTION; CHEMISTRY	For semicrystalline poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT), oxidative chemical vapor deposition (oCVD) enables systematic control over the b-axis lattice parameter (pi-pi stacking distance). Decreasing the b-axis lattice parameter increases the charge transfer integral, thus enhancing intracrystallite mobility. To reduce the barrier to intercrystallite transport, oCVD conditions were tailored to produce pure face-on crystallite orientation rather than the more common edge-on orientation. The face-on oriented oCVD PEDOT with the lowest b-axis lattice parameter displayed the highest in-plane electrical conductivity ( sigma(dc) = 2800 S/cm), largest optical bandgap (2.9 eV), and lowest degree of disorder as characterized by the Urbach band edge energy. With the single step oCVD process at growth conditions compatible with direct deposition onto flexible plastic substrates, the ratio sigma(dc)/sigma(op) reached 50. As compared to spun- cast PEDOT:polystyrene sulfonate, integration of oCVD PEDOT as a hole transport layer (HTL) improved both the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and shelf-life stability of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSC).

The precursor materials are typically prepared in solutions and deposited using common evaporative techniques, some that can be adapted to roll-to-roll manufacturing. However, there are some existing challenges that should be overcome to allow for the films to be stable in ambient conditions such that they can be deposited more cost-effectively. In this work, we report on solution engineering that enables deposition of the perovskite materials in an ambient environment using roll-to-roll applicable technologies. These engineered chemistries were also designed to enable rapid post-processing steps to limit the web length within a conventional oven. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the films achieved consistent morphology and crystallinity, and performed well in solar cell devices. Results of several chemistries and processes will be presented.

Here, the solution processing of MAPbI(3) from PbI2 films in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) is investigated. In-situ grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements reveal a sol-gel process involving three PbI2-DMF solvate complexes-disordered (P-0) and ordered (P-1, P-2)-prior to PbI2 formation. When the appropriate solvated state of PbI2 is exposed to MAI (methylammonium Iodide), it can lead to rapid and complete room temperature conversion into MAPbI(3) with higher quality films and improved solar cell performance. Complementary in-situ optical reflectance, absorbance, and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) measurements show that dry PbI2 can take up only one third of the MAI taken up by the solvated-crystalline P-2 phase of PbI2, requiring additional annealing and yet still underperforming. The perovskite solar cells fabricated from the ordered P-2 precursor show higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) and reproducibility than devices fabricated from other cases. The average PCE of the solar cells is greatly improved from 13.2(+/- 0.53)% (from annealed PbI2) to 15.7(+/- 0.35)% (from P-2) reaching up to 16.2%. This work demonstrates the importance of controlling the solvation of PbI2 as an effective strategy for the growth of high-quality perovskite films and their application in high efficiency and reproducible solar cells.

Here, urea treatment of hole transport layer (e.g., poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)) is reported to effectively tune its morphology, conductivity, and work function for improving the efficiency and stability of inverted MAPbI(3) perovskite solar cells (PSCs). This treatment has significantly increased MAPbI(3) photovoltaic performance to 18.8% for the urea treated PEDOT:PSS PSCs from 14.4% for pristine PEDOT:PSS devices. The use of urea controls phase separation between PEDOT and PSS segments, leading to the formation of a unique fiber-shaped PEDOT:PSS film morphology with well-organized charge transport pathways for improved conductivity from 0.2 S cm(-1) for pristine PEDOT:PSS to 12.75 S cm(-1) for 5 wt% urea treated PEDOT:PSS. The urea-treatment also addresses a general challenge associated with the acidic nature of PEDOT:PSS, leading to a much improved ambient stability of PSCs. In addition, the device hysteresis is significantly minimized by optimizing the urea content in the treatment.

However, the issue of poor charge transport in 2D perovskites limits its application. Here, studies on intermediate-controlled crystal growth are reported to improve charge carrier transport in 2D perovskite thin films. It is shown that the coordination strength of solvents with perovskite precursor affects the initial state of intermediate phase formation as well as the subsequent perovskite layer growth. Tuning the solvent composition with a mixture (5:5) of dimethyl formamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) leads to the growth of highly orientated 2D perovskite films with much-improved optoelectronic properties (faster transport by approximate to 50x, longer carrier lifetime by approximate to 4x, and lower defect density by approximate to 30x) than the film prepared with pure DMF. Consequently, perovskite solar cells based on DMF/DMSO (5:5) show >80% efficiency improvement than the devices based on pure DMF.

Lead (Pb) halide perovskites enable highly efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 23%. However, the energy bandgaps of Pb halide perovskites are larger than the optimal bandgap for single junction solar cells, governed by the Shockley-Queisser (SQ) radiative limit. Mixed tin (Sn)-Pb halide perovskites have drawn significant attention, since their bandgap can be tuned to below 1.2 eV, which opens a door for fabricating all-perovskite tandem solar cells that can break the SQ radiative limit. This review summarizes the development of low-bandgap mixed Sn-Pb PSCs and their applications in all-perovskite tandem solar cells. Its aim is to facilitate the development of new approaches to achieve high efficiency low-bandgap single-junction mixed Sn-Pb PSCs and all-perovskite tandem solar cells.

The PCE of PSCs has remarkably increased from 3.8% to 23.7%, but on the other hand, poor stability is one of the main facets that creates a huge barrier in the commercialization of PSCs. Herein, a concise overview of the current efforts to enhance the stability of PSCs is provided; moreover, the degradation causes and mechanisms are summarized. The strategies to improve device stability are portrayed in terms of structural effects, a photoactive layer, hole- and electron-transporting layers, electrode materials, and device encapsulation. Last but not least, the economic feasibility of PSCs is also vividly discussed.

However, there are very few reports on the use of anion substitutions to develop uniform and highly crystalline perovskite films with large grain size and reduced defects. Here, the first report of employing tetrafluoroborate (BF4-) anion substitutions to improve the properties of (FA = formamidinium, MA = methylammonium (FAPbI(3))(0.83)(MAPbBr(3))(0.17)) perovskite films is demonstrated. The BF4- can be successfully incorporated into a mixed-ion perovskite crystal frame, leading to lattice relaxation and a longer photoluminescence lifetime, higher recombination resistance, and 1-2 orders magnitude lower trap density in prepared perovskite films and derived solar cells. These advantages benefit the performance of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs), resulting in an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.16% from 17.55% due to enhanced open-circuit voltage (V-OC) and fill factor. This is the highest PCE for BF4- anion substituted lead halide PVSCs reported to date. This work provides insight for further exploration of anion substitutions in perovskites to enhance the performance of PVSCs and other optoelectronic devices.

Given that a composition meets basic requirements of stoichiometry, steric demands, and charge neutrality, researchers are now able to investigate a wide range of compounds theoretically and, under various experimental conditions, select the constituting fragments of a crystal. One intriguing playground for such materials design is the perovskite structure. While a game of mixing and matching ions has been played successfully for about 150 years within the limits of inorganic compounds, the recent advances in organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite photovoltaics have triggered the inclusion of organic ions. Organic ions can be incorporated on all sites of the perovskite structure, leading to hybrid (double, triple, etc.) perovskites and inverse (hybrid) perovskites. Examples for each of these cases are known, even with all three sites occupied by organic molecules. While this change from monatomic ions to molecular species is accompanied with increased complexity, it shows that concepts from traditional inorganic perovskites are transferable to the novel hybrid materials. The increased compositional space holds promising new possibilities and applications for the universe of perovskite materials.

Perovskite-based solar cells and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in a comparatively short amount of time. As of writing, a certified power conversion efficiency of 22.7% and an external quantum efficiency of over 10% have been achieved for perovskite solar cells and LEDs, respectively. Interfaces and defects have a critical influence on the properties and operational stability of metal halide perovskite optoelectronic devices. Therefore, interface and defect engineering are crucial to control the behavior of the charge carriers and to grow high quality, defect-free perovskite crystals. Herein, a comprehensive review of various strategies that attempt to modify the interfacial characteristics, control the crystal growth, and understand the defect physics in metal halide perovskites, for both solar cell and LED applications, is presented. Lastly, based on the latest advances and breakthroughs, perspectives and possible directions forward in a bid to transcend what has already been achieved in this vast field of metal halide perovskite optoelectronic devices are discussed.

Pb-based halide perovskite solar cells, in particular, currently stand at a record efficiency of approximate to 23%, fulfilling their potential toward commercialization. However, because of the toxicity concerns of Pb-based perovskite solar cells, their market prospects are hindered. In principle, Pb can be replaced with other less-toxic, environmentally benign metals. Sn-based perovskites are thus the far most promising alternative due to their very similar and perhaps even superior semiconductor characteristics. After years of effort invested in Sn-based halide perovskites, sufficient breakthroughs have finally been achieved that make them the next runners up to the Pb halide perovskites. To help the reader better understand the nature of Sn-based halide perovskites, their optical and electrical properties are systematically discussed. Recent progress in Sn-based perovskite solar cells, focusing mainly on film fabrication methods and different device architectures, and highlighting roadblocks to progress and opportunities for future work are reviewed. Finally, a brief overview of mixed Sn/Pb-based systems with their anomalous yet beneficial optical trends are discussed. The current challenges and a future outlook for Sn-based perovskites are discussed.

Both F-TiO2 and TiOF2 have been studied extensively for this purpose. However, fabrication of fluorine doped titanium oxide requires the use of dangerous fluorinated chemicals such as trifluoroacetic acid, hydrofluoric acid and fluorine gas which are both difficult to handle and create significant waste detrimental for the environment. Additionally, current procedures for fabrication of FTiO2 and TiOF2 require long heating times which are inefficient, wasting large amounts of energy. Because of these factors, fabrication of F-TiO2, TiOF2 and of other important fluorine doped metal oxides is expensive and dangerous to make. In this work, two new methods were used to greatly improve the safety and efficiency of synthesis. First, the fluorinated waste was eliminated by using the safe and inert polymer, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), as the fluorine source. Second, microwave (MW) irradiation was used to reduce the time and energy required for synthesis by addition of the MW absorber, graphene, into the precursor material. The results show that when using the PVDF fluorine source with conventional oven heating it results in low levels of F-TiO2 which are dependent on heating temperatures. However, when using microwave irradiation high levels of doping were achieved creating both F-TiO2 and TiOF2 in as little as 6 min compared to several hours. This work has shown that by combining both PVDF and microwave irradiation fabrication of F-TiO2 and TiOF2 can now be done safely and efficiently with greatly reduced environmental impact.

Design of low bandgap tin-lead halide perovskite solar cells to achieve thermal, atmospheric and operational stability	NATURE ENERGY			English	Article							INDUCED DEGRADATION; THIN-FILMS; INTERFACE; GAP; SN	Low bandgap tin-lead iodide perovskites are key components of all-perovskite tandem solar cells, but can be unstable because tin is prone to oxidation. Here, to avoid a reaction with the most popular hole contact, we eliminated polyethylenedioxythioph ene:polystyrenesulfonate as a hole transport layer and instead used an upward band offset at an indium tin oxide-perovskite heterojunction to extract holes. To suppress oxidative degradation, we improved the morphology to create a compact and large-grained film. The tin content was kept at or below 50% and the device capped with a sputtered indium zinc oxide electrode. These advances resulted in a substantially improved thermal and environmental stability in a low bandgap perovskite solar cell without compromising the efficiency. The solar cells retained 95% of their initial efficiency after 1,000 h at 85 degrees C in air in the dark with no encapsulation and in a damp heat test (85 degrees C with 85% relative humidity) with encapsulation. The full initial efficiency was maintained under operation near the maximum power point and near 1 sun illumination for over 1,000h.

However, during the crystal preparation process, there are inevitably generated surface defect states, which seriously affect the charge transport properties of the single crystal. In this article, the MAPbBr(3) single crystal is prepared by the inverse temperature crystallization method, the semiconductor characteristics of the crystal surface defect states are studied by the Seebeck effect method, and the crystal Seebeck coefficient is enhanced. It is confirmed that there are N-type defect states on the surface of the MAPbBr(3) single crystal. Then the organic semiconductor layer and metal surface modified layer are utilized to reduce the concentration of defects and got the enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient of MAPbBr(3) single crystal. At last, the Au/MAPbBr(3)/PFO/Au structure device is designed and prepared to improve the thermoelectric properties of the MAPbBr(3) single crystal. Results show that the thermal voltage keeps increasing, and the Seebeck coefficient is also enhanced.

In this work, Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets are applied as a novel type of electron transport layer (ETL) in low-temperature processed planar-structured perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Interestingly, simple UV-ozone treatment of the metallic Ti3C2Tx that increases the surface Ti-O bonds without any change in its bulk properties such as high electron mobility improves its suitability as an ETL. Improved electron transfer and suppressed recombination at the ETL/perovskite interface results in augmentation of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 5.00% in the case of Ti3C2Tx without UV-ozone treatment to the champion PCE of 17.17%, achieved using the Ti3C2Tx film after 30 min of UV-ozone treatment. As the first report on the use of pure MXene layer as an ETL in PSCs, this work shows the great potential of MXenes to be used in PSCs and displays their promise for applications in photovoltaic technology in general.

Although such hybrid devices with a small area have been proposed, the fabrication of a large-area perovskite solar module (PSM) containing variable series and parallel connecting modes of subcells for the match with the same-size TEG still remain challenging. This work is to demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating a large-area (16 cm(2)) PSM-TEG device by hybridizing a PSM and a TEG in series. With the combination of series and parallel-connected modes of the PSC subcells, an optimal PSM-TEG device affords a highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.7% with an open-circuit voltage of 6.80 V and a maximum power output of 103 mW under the irradiation of 100 mW/cm(2) condition and maintains 85% of its initial PCE after 400 h under continuous illumination.

Conventional strategies to separate photogenerated carriers typically involve the fabrication of a p-n junction by doping and the use of carrier selective charge transport layers. However, these techniques often require high temperature processes or costly materials. In this work, we demonstrate an innovative and simple approach of extracting photogenerated carriers from organometallic halide perovskites utilizing triboelectricity. The triboelectric device can be easily fabricated at low temperature using inexpensive materials on plastic substrates, enabling it to be readily integrated into self-powered optoelectronic devices. As a proof-of-concept, we fabricated a triboelectrics-assisted perovskite photodetector, which enabled us to study the surface charges generated using different electrical contacts and bending conditions performed by the device. With the assistance of a triboelectric charge-induced electric field, the photocurrent and transient photoresponses were significantly enhanced. Furthermore, we integrated the plastic triboelectric device with a flexible photodetector to demonstrate this carrier collection approach in flexible/wearable electronics. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first report of carrier extraction in organometallic halide perovskite photodetector by triboelectric charges, demonstrating a potential use for carrier extraction in other semiconductor-based optoeletronic devices.

Here we show the effects of polarized excited states on photoluminescence and photocurrent in MAPbBr3 thin-film devices. We found optically polarized transition dipoles, oriented paralleled and perpendicular to device built-in field, give rise to significantly different photoluminescence and photocurrent outcomes. It provides a new understanding that controlling domain geometry can further enhance the light-emitting and photovoltaic performance of perovskite-based applications. The observation proves that the anisotropy of photoexcited transition dipoles is existed in the electronic states of MAPbBr3. Particularly, this indicates that photo-induced electronic polarization can be shown as photoinduced dielectric polarization at the dipolar polarization regime, which impacts device performance. We also observed that increasing photoexcitation intensity leads to a decreases on both field-induced photoluminescence quenching and field-induced photocurrent enhancing, which implies a cooperative interaction between transition dipoles of increased density that favors light emission but infavors charge dissociation. This provides a critical understanding on why organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites can function as efficient photovoltaic and light-emitting materials at low and high excitation intensities, respectively. Our estimation shows that, by manipulating the ratio of dipole orientation, the efficiencies of perovskite-based LEDs and solar cells could be improved by 50% and 18%, respectively. Clearly, the polarization effect presents a new insight on further controlling photovoltaic and light-emitting actions by manipulating the polarization of excited states in perovskite optoelectronics.

The promising long-range hole transport capability in DNA make it potential "molecular wire" in optoelectronics. Here, we demonstrate a core-shell heterostructure of perovskite wrapped by cetyltrimethylammonium chloride modified DNA (DNA-CTMA) through a self-assembly process. Such a design results in enhanced extraction and transport of holes in the bio-photovoltaic device and boosts the efficiency to 20.63%. The hydrophobicity of the DNA-CTMA shell surrounding the perovskite grain boundary is also found to enhance the device stability, as the corresponding cell retained over 90% of initial efficiency after long-term ambient exposure. Building upon the hole transport characteristics of DNA-CTMA, a hole-free device is fabricated that exhibits high power conversion efficiency but has 50 000% reduced cost. These results not only demonstrate breakthrough in designing cheap, efficient, and stable bio-photovoltaics but also open the pathway towards the exciting possibility of controlled interaction between living and artificial semiconductors.

In this research, the role of lattice mismatch in the thermal degradation process of cesium-containing perovskite films on Al doped ZnO (AZO) is studied. A Ba(OH)(2) buffer layer on the surface of AZO is employed to release the lattice mismatch and suppress the thermal degradation of perovskite films resulted from ZnO. Consequently, perovskite films with enhanced thermal stability and crystalline properties are obtained. Meanwhile, the Ba(OH)(2) films efficiently passivate the surface trap states and reduce the vacuum level of the AZO surfaces. On this basis, electron transport layer-free perovskite solar cells yield the best efficiency of 18.18% and the thermal stability is obviously improved.

However, CsPbt(2)Br perovskite is sensitive to moisture, which remarkably deteriorates the stability of CsPbt(2)Br perovskite solar cells under the ambient conditions. Here, by using hydrophobic poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) layer in conjunction with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as the hole transporting layer, we develop a stable and high-performance carbon electrode-based CsPbt(2)Br inorganic perovskite solar cell (PSC). The P3HT-MWCNTs composites not only can prevent moisture ingress but also enhance the holes extraction and transport. A conversion efficiency up to 10.01% with a stabilized efficiency of 8.85% is achieved for the champion device. In addition, the as-prepared carbon electrode-based CsPbt(2)Br PSC exhibits an excellent long-term stability which retains similar to 85% of its initial value over 240 h under the ambient conditions (similar to 35% R.H.) without encapsulation.

Our study suggests that the binding energy of MAPI on SnO2 is weak compared to TiO2 and ZnO. However, we show that the strong binding to TiO2 and ZnO deprotonates CH3NH3 molecules which influences the decomposition process. Among the three interfaces studied in this report, TiO2-based interfaces showed the highest charge transfer followed by the interfaces formed on SnO2. We report a possible interfacial recombination mechanism inside MAPI/TiO2 and MAPI/SnO2 devices. Our study concludes that MAPI/SnO2 interfaces provide advantages due to their improved stability for perovskite solar cells.

ZnO has been recognized as the promising electron transport layer (ETL) that may overcome the limitations of the conventional TiO2. However, methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)) perovskite is prone to decomposition at the ZnO surface, which hinders the development of simple one-step deposition of perovskite, resulting in the limited photovoltaic performance. Herein, we report interlayer mediated efficient ETLs for viable flexible PSCs. The utilization of polyethyleneimine ethoxylated layer on ZnO prevents the direct contact between the perovskite and Ells, avoiding the photoactive layer decomposition. Thus, interlayer-mediated PSCs show higher efficiency with enhanced stability by decreasing the electron transport barrier. As a result, the PSC employing tailor-designed ETL interfaces exhibited average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.8%, which was superior by 25.4%	[Lim, Ju Won; Wang, Huan; Choi, Chi Hun; Chung, Kyungwha; Kim, Dong Ha] Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Chem & Nano Sci, 52 Ewhayeodae Gil, Seoul 03760, South Korea; [Lim, Ju Won] Univ Michigan, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Quan, Li Na] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Park, Won-Tae] Dongguk Univ, Dept Energy Mat & Engn, 30 Pildong Ro,1 Gil, Seoul 04620, South Korea; [Chung, Kyungwha] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Energy Sci, Suwon 16419, South Korea; [Wang, Huan] Northeast Petr Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Daqing 163318, Peoples R China; [Noh, Yong-Young] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Dept Chem Engn, 77 Cheongam Ro, Pohang 37673, South Korea	Kim, DH (reprint author), Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Chem & Nano Sci, 52 Ewhayeodae Gil, Seoul 03760, South Korea.	dhkim@ewha.ac.kr	Quan, Lina/AAE-7649-2019; Kim, Dong Ha/B-3778-2008	Quan, Lina/0000-0001-9301-3764; Kim, Dong Ha/0000-0003-0444-0479	National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean GovernmentNational Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government [2017R1A2A1A05022387, 2015M1A2A2058365]; Creative Materials Discovery Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT [2018M3D1A1058536]; Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) of the Republic of Korea [20173010013340]; Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE) of the Republic of Korea [20173010013340]	This work was supported by National Research Foundation of Korea Grants funded by the Korean Government (2017R1A2A1A05022387, 2015M1A2A2058365), by Creative Materials Discovery Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by Ministry of Science and ICT (2018M3D1A1058536) and by the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) and the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE) of the Republic of Korea (No. 20173010013340).		51	2	2	26	26	ELSEVIER	AMSTERDAM	RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS	0378-7753	1873-2755		J POWER SOURCES	J.

In this study, we report efficient perovskite solar cells through suppressed nonradiative charge carrier recombination by a processing additive, aminopropanoic acid. It is found that aminopropanoic acid not only modulates the crystal growth processes but also minimizes the defects of CH3NH3PbI3 thin films. Moreover, the CH3NH3PbI3 thin films processed with the addition of aminopropanoic acid exhibit both enhanced photoluminescence and electroluminescence and elongated charge carrier lifetime, indicating that nonradiative charge carrier recombination within the CH3NH3PbI3 thin films is drastically suppressed. As a result, perovskite solar cells fabricated using the CH3NH3PbI3 thin films processed with the addition of aminopropanoic acid exhibit approximately 15% enhanced efficiency as compared with those made with pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin films. All of these results demonstrate that our findings provide a facile way to improve the efficiency of perovskite solar cells.

To address this limitation, the introduction of Ti3+ defects represents a common strategy to render TiO2 visible-light responsive. Unfortunately, current hurdles in Ti3+ generation technologies impeded the widespread application of Ti3+ modified materials. Herein, we demonstrate a simple and mechanistically distinct approach to generating abundant surface-Ti3+ sites without leaving behind oxygen vacancy and sacrificing one-off electron donors. In particular, upon adsorption of organodiboron reagents onto TiO2 nanoparticles, spontaneous electron injection from the diboron-bound O-2(-) site to adjacent Ti4+ site leads to an extremely stable blue surface Ti3+-O(-center dot)complex. Notably, this defect generation protocol is also applicable to other semiconductor oxides including ZnO, SnO2, Nb2O5, and In2O3. Furthermore, the as-prepared photoelectronic device using this strategy affords 103-fold higher visible light response and the fabricated perovskite solar cell shows an enhanced performance.

A fundamental understanding of the liquid-to-solid transformation mechanism is thus essential to the fabrication of high-quality thin films of halide perovskite crystals for applications such as high-performance photovoltaics and is the topic of this Review. The roles of additives on the evolution of coordination complex species in the precursor solutions and the resulting effect on perovskite crystallization are presented. The influence of colloid characteristics, DMF/DMSO-free solutions and the degradation of precursor solutions on the formation of perovskite crystals are also discussed.

Specifically, a visible PL peaked at 520 nm is observed with the quadratic power dependence by exciting the gap states with CW 980 nm laser excitation, indicating a two-photon up-conversion PL occurring in quasi-2D perovskite films. Decreasing the gap states by reducing the n value leads to a dramatic decrease in the two-photon up-conversion PL signal. This confirms that the gap states are indeed responsible for generating the two-photon up-conversion PL in quasi-2D perovskites. Furthermore, mechanical scratching indicates that the different-n-value nanoplates are essentially uniformly formed in the quasi-2D perovskite films toward generating multi-photon up-conversion light emission. More importantly, the two-photon up-conversion PL is found to be sensitive to an external magnetic field, indicating that the gap states are essentially formed as spatially extended states ready for multi-photon excitation. Polarization-dependent up-conversion PL studies reveal that the gap states experience the orbit-orbit interaction through Coulomb polarization to form spatially extended states toward developing multi-photon up-conversion light emission in quasi-2D perovskites.

However, their low device stability limits further advancement. Hygroscopic lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li+TFSI-) and metal electrode are the main causes of the device instability. In this work, the redox reaction between lithium-ion endohedral fullerenes and 2,2',7,7'-tetrakis (N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9'-spirobi-fluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) was controlled to optimize the amount of oxidized spiro-MeOTAD and antioxidizing neutral endohedral fullerenes. Application of this mixture to metal-free carbon nanotube (CNT)-laminated perovskite solar cells resulted in 17.2% efficiency with a stability time of more than 1100 h under severe conditions (temperature = 60 degrees C, humidity = 70%). Such high performance is attributed to the uninhibited charge flow, no metal-ion migration, and the enhanced antioxidizing activity of the devices.

Charge-Carrier Recombination in Halide Perovskites	CHEMICAL REVIEWS			English	Review							LEAD-IODIDE PEROVSKITE; OPEN-CIRCUIT VOLTAGE; RADIATIVE RECOMBINATION; NONRADIATIVE LOSSES; QUANTUM EFFICIENCY; BAND-GAP; N-TYPE; LIFETIME; ELECTRON; GAAS	The success of halide perovskites in a host of optoelectronic applications is often attributed to their long photoexcited carrier lifetimes, which has led to charge-carrier recombination processes being described as unique compared to other semiconductors. Here, we integrate recent literature findings to provide a critical assessment of the factors we believe are most likely controlling recombination in the most widely studied halide perovskite systems. We focus on four mechanisms that have been proposed to affect measured charge carrier recombination lifetimes, namely: (1) recombination via trap states, (2) polaron formation, (3) the indirect nature of the bandgap (e.g., Rashba effect), and (4) photon recycling. We scrutinize the evidence for each case and the implications of each process on carrier recombination dynamics. Although they have attracted considerable speculation, we conclude that multiple trapping or hopping in shallow trap states, and the possible indirect nature of the bandgap (e.g., Rashba effect), seem to be less likely given the combined evidence, at least in high-quality samples most relevant to solar cells and light-emitting diodes. On the other hand, photon recycling appears to play a clear role in increasing apparent lifetime for samples with high photoluminescence quantum yields. We conclude that polaron dynamics are intriguing and deserving of further study. We highlight potential interdependencies of these processes and suggest future experiments to better decouple their relative contributions. A more complete understanding of the recombination processes could allow us to rationally tailor the properties of these fascinating semiconductors and will aid the discovery of other materials exhibiting similarly exceptional optoelectronic properties.

Interference between the atomic displacement patterns of oppositely charged (bi)polarons generates a short-range repulsion which impedes their recombination, significantly enhancing efficiencies of energy conversion devices, e.g., perovskite solar cells. A large-(bi)polaron's atomic vibrations are softened by the relaxation of its self-trapped electronic carriers. Scattering of impinging ambient phonons by large-bipolarons' softened vibrations generates distinctive transport. Coherence between the softened atomic vibrations of large-bipolarons generates a phonon-assisted mutual attraction which facilitates their condensation into a liquid. A large-bipolaron liquid's superconducting Bose condensate is characterized by coherent zero-point atomic vibrations which decrease positron annihilation and increase ion channeling. Imposed disorder can trigger electronic charge carriers' collapse into small polarons. The back-and-forth Arrhenius hopping of a small polaron softens the associated atoms' vibrations thereby increasing their entropy. This effect explains the empirically observed Meyer-Neldel compensation effect. In particular, the temperature-independent factor of the jump rate increases exponentially in proportion to its activation energy.

The ferrocene redox couple (Fc(+)/Fc(0), E-0 = -4.9 eV vs vacuum) has now been used as a model redox relay system to investigate photocatalytic properties of CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals. The photocatalytic reduction of ferrocenium (Fc(+)) to ferrocene (Fc(0)) with CsPbBr3 nanocrystals was dictated by the surface interactions. Whereas a rapid quenching and subsequent recovery of CsPbBr3 emission is seen at low Fc(+) concentrations, the quenched emission was sustained at higher Fc(+) concentrations. The photoinduced interfacial electron transfer between CsPbBr3 and ferrocenium (Fc(+)) studied using transient absorption spectroscopy occurred with a rate constant of 1.64 X 10(10) s(-1). Better understanding of interfacial processes using redox probes can lead to the improvement in photocatalytic performance of perovskite nanocrystals.

Anharmonicity Extends Carrier Lifetimes in Lead Halide Perovskites at Elevated Temperatures	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article							DEPENDENT PHOTOLUMINESCENCE; QUANTUM DOTS; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; SOLAR-CELLS; ENERGY-GAP; NANOCRYSTALS; DIFFUSION; CSPBBR3; RECOMBINATION; RELAXATION	Lead halide perovskites constitute a very promising class of materials for a broad range of solar and optoelectronic applications. Perovskites exhibit many unusual properties, and recent experiments demonstrate an unusual temperature dependence of charge carrier lifetimes. Focusing on the all-inorganic CsPbBr3, and using a combination of ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics and time-domain density functional theory, we demonstrate that the unconventional behavior arises because of a highly anharmonic nature of atomic motions in perovskites. As temperature increases, perovskite structure undergoes a notable deformation, reflected in tilting of octahedral units, and experiences large-scale anharmonic movements away from the equilibrium geometry. As a result, the electronic energy gap increases, and phonon-induced loss of coherence within the electronic subsystem accelerates. These two factors slow down nonradiative electron-hole recombination, which constitutes the main limitation on efficiencies of perovskite solar, optical, and electronic devices. The increase of charge carrier lifetimes with temperature is particularly beneficial in applications, because materials heat up, for instance, from sunlight during solar energy harvesting. The behavior of the all-inorganic halide perovskite investigated here is different from that of hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites, which exhibit additional disorder associated with reorientations of the asymmetric organic cations. The reported simulations generate an in-depth understanding of the unusual properties of inorganic perovskites, relevant for photocatalytic, photovoltaic, electronic, and optical applications.

Herein, it is found that the unsatisfactory performance of planar heterojunction (PHJ) f-PSCs can be attributed to the undesirable morphology of electron transport layer (ETL), which results from the rough surface of the flexible substrate. Precise control over the thickness and morphology of ETL tin dioxide (SnO2) not only reduces the reflectance of the indium tin oxide (ITO) on polyethylene 2,6-naphthalate (PEN) substrate and enhances photon collection, but also decreases the trap-state densities of perovskite films and the charge transfer resistance, leading to a great enhancement of device performance. Consequently, the f-PSCs, with a structure of PEN/ITO/SnO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag, exhibit a power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 19.51% and a steady output of 19.01%. Furthermore, the f-PSCs show a robust bending resistance and maintain about 95% of initial PCE after 6000 bending cycles at a bending radius of 8 mm, and they present an outstanding long-term stability and retain about 90% of the initial performance after >1000 h storage in air (10% relative humidity) without encapsulation.

Unveiling the Photo- and Thermal-Stability of Cesium Lead Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals	CHEMPHYSCHEM			English	Article						degradation; lead halide perovskites; photostability; semiconductor nanocrystals; single crystal luminescence	ANION-EXCHANGE; PHOTOLUMINESCENCE BLINKING; CSPBBR3 NANOCRYSTALS; SURFACE PASSIVATION; QUANTUM DOTS; HIGH-QUALITY; SOLAR-CELLS; LUMINESCENCE; CSPBX3; EMISSION	Lead halide perovskites possess unique characteristics that are well-suited for optoelectronic and energy capture devices, however, concerns about their long-term stability remain. Limited stability is often linked to the methylammonium cation, and all-inorganic CsPbX3 (X=Cl, Br, I) perovskite nanocrystals have been reported with improved stability. In this work, the photostability and thermal stability properties of CsPbX3 (X=Cl, Br, I) nanocrystals were investigated by means of electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis coupled with FTIR (TGA-FTIR), ensemble and single particle spectral characterization. CsPbBr3 was found to be stable under 1-sun illumination for 16 h in ambient conditions, although single crystal luminescence analysis after illumination using a solar simulator indicates that the luminescence states are changing over time. CsPbBr3 was also stable to heating to 250 degrees C. Large CsPbI3 crystals (34 +/- 5 nm) were shown to be the least stable composition under the same conditions as both XRD reflections and Raman bands diminish under irradiation; and with heating the gamma (black) phase reverts to the non-luminescent delta phase. Smaller CsPbI3 nanocrystals (14 +/- 2 nm) purified by a different washing strategy exhibited improved photostability with no evidence of crystal growth but were still thermally unstable. Both CsPbCl3 and CsPbBr3 show crystal growth under irradiation or heat, likely with a preferential orientation based on XRD patterns. TGA-FTIR revealed nanocrystal mass loss was only from liberation and subsequent degradation of surface ligands. Encapsulation or other protective strategies should be employed for long-term stability of these materials under conditions of high irradiance or temperature.

Unfortunately, it has been challenging to achieve high-quality films over large areas using scalable methods under realistic ambient conditions. Herein, we investigated the coupling between the fluid dynamics and the structural evolution during controlled film formation for ambient scalable fabrication of CsPbl(2)Br perovskite films using blade coating. We simultaneously overcame the negative influences of moisture attack and the Benard-Marangoni instability in the drying ink and achieved an ideal sequential crystallization with changing halide composition during the film formation. As a result, we produced highly crystalline, uniform, and pinhole-free CsPbl(2)Br films with superior photophysical and transport properties. High-performance solar cells are fabricated to achieve power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 14.7% for small-aperture-area (0.03 cm(2)) devices and 12.5% for the large-aperture-area (1.0 cm(2)) ones, the highest PCE reported to date for large-area all-inorganic perovskite solar cells.

Among the various types of nanostructures, silicon NPs, which support Mie modes and have lower losses compared with metallic particles with plasmon resonances, exhibit the best improvement for standard methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3))-based solar cells. Herein, not only the optical problem of solar cell optimization with silicon nanoantennas is studied, but also the effects related to charge carrier transport in the presence of NPs are considered. In particular, it is theoretically shown that the silicon nanoantennas can be further optimized by p-doping. The experimental verification is conducted for MAPbI(3)-based solar cells by p-doped silicon NPs in a hole transport layer (Spiro-OMeTAD). The improved generation rate of charge carriers and hole transport through the doped silicon NPs leads to improved efficiency of the device.

We demonstrate that incorporation of GUA forms electronic and ionic accumulation regions at the interface of the electron transporting layer and perovskite absorber layer. Our electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results prove that the formed accumulation region is associated with the enhanced surface charge capacitance and photovoltage. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the influence of the GUA ions on the enhanced interfacial and bulk electronic properties due to more efficient charge transfer between the bulk and interfaces and the reduced electronic defect energy levels.

Moreover, combining the use of their porous nature with tailored reactivity at the metal struts and organic linkers provides valuable tools for energy-related applications. An exciting new research area that is expected to be highly beneficial for energy-related MOF use is the control of MOF morphology to develop nanosheets, nanorods and nanocrystals. Nanoscale MOFs offer larger external surface areas, easier access to functional groups, and close contact with other materials in hybrid structures that result in faster electron and ion transfer, in addition to ease of fabrication into thin films. This review provides an overview of the recent development of nanoscale MOFs as pristine materials or as a component in hybrid structures for solar energy conversion, supercapacitors, batteries and fuel cells.

ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						perovskite solar cells; hole-transporting materials; titanyl phthalocyanines; nonperipheral substituents; power conversion efficiency	ELECTRON; PERFORMANCE; RECOMBINATION; ABSORPTION; SURFACE; LAYERS	We demonstrate a molecular design strategy to enhance the efficiency of phthalocyanine (Pc)-based hole-transporting materials (HTMs) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, two titanyl phthalocyanine (TiOPc) derivatives are designed and applied as dopant-free HTMs in planar n-i-p-structured PSCs. The newly developed TiOPc compounds possess eight n-hexylthio groups attached to either peripheral (P-SC6-TiOPc) or nonperipheral (NP-SC6-TiOPc) positions of the Pc ring. Utilizing these dopant-free HTMs in PSCs with a mixed cation perovskite as the light absorbing material and tin oxide (SnO2) as the electron-transporting material (ETM) results in a considerably enhanced efficiency for NP-SC6-TiOPc-based devices compared to PSCs using P-SC6-TiOPc. Hence, all of the photovoltaic parameters, including power conversion efficiency (PCE), fill factor, open-circuit voltage, and short-circuit current density, are remarkably improved from 5.33 +/- 1.01%, 33.34 +/- 3.45%, 0.92 +/- 0.18 V, and 17.33 +/- 2.08 mA cm(-2) to 15.83 +/- 0.44%, 69.03 +/- 1.59%, 1.05 +/- 0.01 V, and 21.80 +/- 0.36 mA cm(-2), respectively, when using the nonperipheral-substituted TiOPc derivative as the HTM in a PSC. Experimental and computational analysis suggests more compact molecular packing for NP-SC6-TiOPc than P-SC6-TiOPc in the solid state due to stronger pi-pi interactions, leading to thin films with better quality and higher performance in hole extraction and transportation. PSCs with NP-SC6-TiOPc also offer much higher long-term stability than P-SC6-TiOPc-based devices under ambient conditions with a relative humidity of 75%.

Surface Science and Colloidal Stability of Double-Perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 Nanocrystals and Their Superlattices	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							HALIDE PEROVSKITES; SOLAR-CELLS; LEAD; ABSORPTION; EMISSION; EXCHANGE; LIGANDS; BINDING; PHASE; BR	Capping ligand bonding and the thermal and colloidal stability of Cs2AgBiBr6 nanocrystals were studied. Oleylamine and oleic acid bonding to Cs2AgBiBr6 nanocrystals was studied with H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy. Both molecules are present in the ionic metathesis synthesis reaction, but only oleylamine remains bound to the nanocrystals after purification. Oleic acid is not a capping ligand; however, the synthesis requires it, and its concentration determines the yield of the reaction while oleylamine primarily affects the uniformity of the sample. Substitution of oleic acid in the reaction with diisooctylphosphinic acid still yielded nanocrystals with similar size, cuboidal shape, uniformity, cubic double-perovskite crystal structure, and optical properties. Nanocrystals were assembled into superlattices and heated in air. Grazing incidence small-angle and wide-angle X-ray scattering showed that the nanocrystals sinter at 250 degrees C, but the crystal structure and preferred crystal orientation on the substrate does not change. When nanocrystals were dispersed in hexane and exposed to light, they precipitated within 24 h. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the aggregated nanocrystals still retained their initial size and shape and had not coalesced.

These values were consistent with the reported values of ionic conduction in thin-film perovskite solar cells. We monitored an electrochemical impedance response arising from ionic conductivity through MAPbI(3) and a methylammonium selective layer. We could fit this complex impedance response to an intuitive circuit model, which revealed an ionic species moving on a ms time scale. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) revealed direct chemical evidence of methylammonium diffusion into the ion-selective layer. We found no experimental evidence indicating the mobility of lead ions or protons, suggesting that the mobile species observed under illumination is likely methylammonium.

Such a gradient structure allows for the integrated capture of visible photons and directs them to the energetically low-lying iodide rich region. Annealing gradient halide perovskite films at temperatures ranging from 50 degrees C to 90 degrees C causes the films to homogenize into mixed halide perovskites. The movement of halide ions during the homogenization process was elucidated using UV-Visible absorbance and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The halide ion movement in CsPbBr3-xIx gradient films was tracked via absorbance changes in the visible region of the spectrum that enabled us to measure the temperature dependent rate constant and energy of activation (74.5 kJ/mol) of halide ion homogenization. Excited state processes of both gradient and homogenized films probed through transient absorption spectroscopy showed the direct flow of charge carriers and charge recombination in both films.

The crystal structure comprises perovskite-like layers separated by organic cation spacers. Here two Ruddlesden-Popper compounds with a conjugated cation, 2-(4-biphenyl)ethylammonium (BPEA) prepared by solvothermal and solvent evaporation techniques are reported. The structures of the two compounds: (BPEA)(2)PbI4 and (BPEA)(2)(CH3NH3)Pb2I7, were solved by X-ray crystallography. The aromatic rings of the BPEA groups are well-separated in the organic layers leading to optical properties comparable to n = 1 and 2 hybrid halide Ruddlesden-Popper compounds with simpler alkyl ammonium cations. The ambient stability of both compounds over time was also confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction. Finally, the transient photoconductance, measured by time-resolved microwave conductivity, show that the compounds have maximum yield-mobility products respectively of 0.07 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) and 1.11 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) for (BPEA)(2)PbI4 and (BPEA)(2)(CH3NH3)Pb2I7, both slightly enhanced over what has been measured for compounds with n-butylammonium spacer cations.

However, commonly used tin-based narrow-bandgap perovskites have shorter carrier diffusion lengths and lower absorption coefficient than lead-based perovskites, limiting the efficiency of perovskite-perovskite tandem solar cells. In this work, we discover that the charge collection efficiency in tin-based PSCs is limited by a short diffusion length of electrons. Adding 0.03 molar percent of cadmium ions into tin-perovskite precursors reduce the background free hole concentration and electron trap density, yielding a long electron diffusion length of 2.72 +/- 0.15 mu m. It increases the optimized thickness of narrow-bandgap perovskite films to 1000 nm, yielding exceptional stabilized efficiencies of 20.2 and 22.7% for single junction narrow-bandgap PSCs and monolithic perovskite-perovskite tandem cells, respectively. This work provides a promising method to enhance the optoelectronic properties of narrow-bandgap perovskites and unleash the potential of perovskite-perovskite tandem solar cells.

Nonradiative electron-hole recombination is the main source of charge and energy losses, limiting material efficiency. Experiments show that edge states in 2D halide perovskites accelerate exciton dissociation into long-lived charge carriers, improving performance. Using a combination of nonadiabatic molecular dynamics and time-domain density functional theory, we demonstrate that unsaturated chemical bonds of iodine atoms at perovskite edges is the main driving force for hole localization. Chemically unsaturated Pb atoms confine electrons to a much lesser extent, because they more easily support different oxidation states and heal chemical defects. This difference between defects associated with metals and nonmetals is general to many nanoscale systems. Thermal atomic fluctuations play important roles in charge localization, even in the bulk region of 2D perovskite films, a phenomenon that is different from polaron formation. Charge localization at edges is robust to thermal excitation at ambient conditions. The separated charges live a long time, because the nonadiabatic coupling between the excited and ground states is small, under 1 meV, and quantum coherence is short, less than 10 fs. The calculations agree very well with the time-resolved optical measurements on both luminescence lifetime and line width. The detailed understanding of the excited state dynamics in the 2D halide perovskites generated by the simulations highlights the unique chemical properties of these materials, and provides guidelines for design of efficient and inexpensive solar energy materials.

Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of a stable Sn (II)-based two-dimensional perovskite featuring a pi-conjugated oligothiophene ligand, namely (4Tm)(2)SnI4, where 4Tm is 2-(3''',4'-dimethyl-[2,2' :5',2 '' :5 '',2'''-quaterthiophen]-5-yl) ethan-1-ammonium. The conjugated ligands facilitate formation of micrometer-size large grains, improve charge injections, and stabilize the inorganic perovskite layers. Thin film field-effect transistors based on (4Tm)(2)SnI4 exhibit enhanced hole mobility up to 2.32 cm(2) V(-1)s(-1) and dramatically improved stability over the previous benchmark material (PEA)(2)SnI4. Stabilization mechanisms were investigated via single-crystal structure analysis as well as density functional theory calculations. It was found that the large conjugated organic layers not only serve as thick and dense barriers for moisture and oxygen but also increase the crystal formation energy via strong intermolecular interactions. This work demonstrates the great potential of molecular engineering for organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite materials toward applications in high-performance electronics and optoelectronics.

In this work, we present a halogen element (chlorine) doping strategy to design low-cost perovskite-type electrocatalysts with enhanced IRR activity and stability. The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) assembled by the LaFeO2.965-delta Cl0.035 cathode delivers an attractive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.4% with a remarkable PCE enhancement factor of 23% compared with Pt, which is higher than most of the reported non-Pt DSSC cathodes. Attractively, LaFeO2.965-delta Cl0.035 displays superior IRR activity/stability and structural stability in the I-3(-)/I--based electrolyte compared to pristine LaFeO3 because chlorine doping facilitates the creation of oxygen vacancies (active sites) and enhances surface acidity simultaneously. This study provides a new way for designing outstanding IRR electrocatalysts, which could be applied to many redox couple-mediated photo/electrochemical devices.

Understanding the interaction between layers inside a cell and how they react with the environment is important to achieve optimum manufacturing processes, and improve efficiency of perovskite solar cells. Here, we probe a hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite cell structure formed by a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), cassiterite (SnO2), mixed halide perovskite, Spiro-OMeTAD and silver layers. We have demonstrated a power conversion efficiency (PCE) greater than 19% and aV(oc) of more than 1.1 V for a wide-band gap (1.6 eV) perovskite solar cell. (c) 2019 Author(s).

Achieving High-Quality Sn-Pb Perovskite Films on Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor-Compatible Metal/Silicon Substrates for Efficient Imaging Array	ACS NANO			English	Article						low-band-gap perovskites; Sn-Pb-based perovskites; photodiodes; near-infrared imaging; room-temperature crystallization; CMOS-compatible metal/silicon substrates	SOLAR-CELLS; PHOTODETECTORS; ENERGY; NOISE; LIGHT	Although Sn-Pb perovskites sensing nearultraviolet-visible-near-infrared light could be an attractive alternative to silicon in photodiodes and imaging, there have been no clear studies on such devices constructed on metal/silicon substrates, hindering their direct integration with complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) and silicon electronics. Typically, high surface roughness and severe pinholes of Sn-rich binary perovskites make it difficult for them to fulfill the requirements of efficient photodiodes and imaging. These issues cause inherently high dark current and poor (dark and photo-) current uniformity. Herein, we propose and demonstrate the room-temperature crystallization in the Sn-rich binary perovskite system to effectively control film crystallization kinetics. With experimental and theoretical studies of the crystallization mechanism, we successfully tune the density and location of nanocrystals in precursor films to achieve compact nanocrystals, which coalesce into high-quality (smooth, dense, and pinhole-free) perovskites with intensified preferred orientation and decreased trap density. The high-quality perovskites reduce dark current and improve (dark and photo-) current uniformity of perovskite photodiodes on CMOS-compatible metal/silicon substrates. Meanwhile, self-powered devices achieve a high responsivity of 0.2 A/W at 940 nm, a large dynamic range of 100 dB, and a fast fall time of 2.27 mu s, exceeding those of most silicon-based imaging sensors. Finally, a 6 x 6 pixel integrated photodiode array is successfully demonstrated to realize the imaging application. The work contributes to understanding the fundamentals of the crystallization of Sn-rich binary perovskites and advancing perovskite integration with Si-based electronics.

Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been extensively used as an ETL in PSCs; however, high temperature thermal annealing requirement impedes its integration with flexible polymer substrates for roll to roll fabrication. Herein, we have demonstrated that SnO2 is a potential ETL candidate when fabricated at low temperature (180 degrees C) using spin coating technique. XRD and XPS analysis revealed synthesis of rutile SnO2 tetragonal phase. TEM micrographs with SAED pattern proved formation of nanosized (3 to 4 nm) crystals of SnO2 with polycrystalline phase. FESEM analysis revealed the SnO2 nanocrystals fully covered the FTO surface and elemental mapping confirmed the uniformly distribution tin (Sn) and (O) elements throughout the surface. In addition to this, transmission analysis confirmed that SnO2 film exhibited good transmission property. PSCs were fabricated in ambient air (relative humidity ranges from 55% to 65%) with concentrated SnO2 colloidal solution and diluted SnO2 with different concentrations (1:1 v/v, 1:2 v/v, 1:4 v/v and 1:6 v/v). It was found that 1:4 v/v based diluted colloidal solution of SnO2 in DI water film exhibited the highest PSC performance of 8.51% in ambient conditions. Thus, low temperature solution processed SnO2 is an efficient ETL and well-suited for low cost automated fabrication of PSCs at large scale.

However, obtaining a detailed understanding of interfacial mechanism at the 2D/3D heterojunction, for example, the ligand-chemistry-dependent nature of the 2D/3D heterojunction and its influence on charge collection and the final photovoltaic outcome, is not yet fully developed. Here we demonstrate the underlying 3D phase templates growth of quantum wells (QWs) within a 2D capping layer, which is further influenced by the fluorination of spacers and compositional engineering in terms of thickness distribution and orientation. Better QW alignment and faster dynamics of charge transfer at the 2D/3D heterojunction result in higher charge mobility and lower charge recombination loss, largely explaining the significant improvements in charge collection and open-circuit voltage (V-OC) in complete solar cells. As a result, 2D/3D solar cells with a power-conversion efficiency of 21.15% were achieved, significantly higher than the 3D counterpart (19.02%). This work provides key missing information on how interfacial engineering influences the desirable electronic properties of the 2D/3D hierarchical films and device performance via ligand chemistry and compositional engineering in the QW layer.

Interfacial charge-transfer doping of metal halide perovskites for high performance photovoltaics	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; ANOMALOUS HYSTERESIS; ELECTRON-AFFINITY; CARRIER LIFETIME; EFFICIENT; PHOTOLUMINESCENCE; IMPACT; CRYSTALLIZATION; CONDUCTIVITY; COLLECTION	The remarkable optoelectronic properties of metal halide perovskites have generated intense research interest over the last few years. The ability to control and manipulate the crystallisation and stoichiometry of perovskite thin-films has allowed for impressive strides in the development of highly efficient perovskite solar cells. However, being able to effectively modify the interfaces of metal halide perovskites, and to controllably p- or n-type dope the surfaces, may be key to further improvements in the efficiency and long-term stability of these devices. In this study, we use surface doping of the mixed-cation, mixed-halide perovskite FA(0.85)MA(0.15)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)(3) (FA - formamidinium; MA - methylammonium) to improve the hole extraction from the perovskite solar cell. By treating the surface of the perovskite film with a strongly oxidizing molybdenum tris(dithiolene) complex, we achieve a shift in the work function that is indicative of p-doping, and a twofold increase in the total conductivity throughout the film. We probe the associated interfacial chemistry through photoelectron and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies and confirm that charge-transfer occurs between the perovskite and dopant complex. The resulting p-doped interface constitutes a homojunction with increased hole-selectivity. With charge-selective layers, we show that this surface doping enhances the device performance of perovskite solar cells resulting in steady-state efficiencies approaching 21%. Finally, we demonstrate that a surface treatment with this dopant produces the same effect as the commonly employed additive 4-tert butylpyridine (tBP), allowing us to achieve "tBP-free" devices with steady-state efficiencies of over 20%, and enhanced thermal stability as compared to devices processed using tBP. Our findings therefore demonstrate that molecular doping is a feasible route to tune and control the surface properties of metal halide perovskites.

We investigated the mechanical fracture behavior of polycrystalline perovskite films by varying the substrate thickness and applying the neutral plane concept. This enabled us to fabricate a crack-free perovskite film on an ultra-thin substrate (similar to 2.5 mu m) and to demonstrate ultra-flexible solar cells with high efficiency (17.03%) with unprecedented flexibility sustained after 10 000 cycles of bending at a 0.5 mm radius. This represents a high efficiency of 13.6% for large-area flexible perovskite solar cells (1.2 cm(2)), fabricated by using a hybrid transparent electrode composed of a metal mesh grid and conducting polymer. Using a protective layer to achieve the neutral plane concept, our ultra-flexible perovskite solar cells are demonstrated to be durable even after 100 crumpling cycles. Our approach paves the way to fabricate flexible perovskite solar cells for portable power sources.

But most of research studies focused on the pristine hybrid perovskite CH3NH3PbI3. In this study, we utilize a newly developed CH3NH3PbI3:xNd(3+) (x = 0.5 mol %) thin film, where Pb2+ is partially substituted by a heterovalent Nd3+ cation, as the photoactive layer for solution-processed perovskite photodetectors. It is found that the resultant CH3NH3PbI3:xNd(3+) (x = 0.5 mol %) thin film possesses superior thin film morphology, enhanced and balanced charge carrier mobilities, and suppressed trap density, resulting in enhanced photocurrent and reduced dark current for perovskite photodetectors by the CH3NH3PbI3:xNd(3+) (x = 0.5 mol %) thin film. Thus, operated at room temperature, solution-processed perovskite photodetectors exhibit over 10(14) cm Hz(1/2) W-1 photodetectivity in a spectrum range from 350 to 800 nm, a linear dynamic range over 100 dB, and fast response time. All these results indicate that high-performance solution-processed perovskite photodetectors can be realized by novel hybrid perovskite materials, where Pb2+ is partially substituted by heterovalent Nd3+ cations.

However, a machine learning (ML) approach to guide the development of high-performing PSCs is still lacking. In this paper ML is used to optimize material composition, develop design strategies, and predict the performance of PSCs. The ML models are developed using 333 data points selected from about 2000 peer reviewed publications. These models guide the design of new perovskite materials and the development of high-performing solar cells. Based on ML guidance, new perovskite compositions are experimentally synthesized to test the practicability of the model. The ML model also shows its ability to predict underlying physical phenomena as well as the performance of PSCs. The PSC model matches well with the theoretical prediction by the Shockley and Queisser limit, which is almost impossible for a human to find from an ensemble of data points. Moreover, strategies for developing high-performing PSCs with different bandgaps are also derived from the model. These findings show that ML is very promising not only for predicting the performance, but also for providing a deeper understanding of the physical phenomena associated with the PSCs.

Here, we establish a two-round pressure-assisted solvent-engineering (TPS) strategy to achieve remarkable enhancement in grain size (similar to 400 mu m(2)), crystallinity, orientation and, especially, boundary fusion. Crystal growth and boundary welding of MAPbI(3) grains are mainly attributed to pressure-enhanced ion diffusion and defect elimination, which facilitates lateral enlargement of grains and formation of ultra-smooth film. Dramatic diminution of trap density determines long carrier lifetime and improved lateral charge transport, as demonstrated by the superior performance of MAPbI(3)-based photodetectors, e.g. ultrahigh on/off ratio (similar to 10(6)), good stability, fast response, high responsivity and high detectivity (1.3 x 10(14) Jones). When upconversion nanoparticles are uniformly assembled on the high-quality MAPbI(3) films, interestingly, the hybrid device exhibits dominantly elevated photoelectric capability in near infrared range (NIR, 980 nm) with long-term stability in ambient air. The results and method pave a novel way for ongoing fabrication of efficient and stable optoelectronic devices based on high-quality perovskite films.

Among the reported highly efficient devices, most were fabricated in a well-controlled inert environment. However, large-scale manufacturing requires ambient processing, which affects the crystallization process of OHP. Recently, considerable attention has been drawn to developing air-processed OHP solar cells, in terms of scientific understanding of the crystallization process and developing processes compatible with large volume manufacturing. This review article summarizes the recent progress made in air-processed OHP solar cells. Specifically, we focus on (1) the microscopic understanding of the impact of the ambient environment on the crystallization process of OHP composites, (2) the approaches to control the crystallization and morphology of OHP in ambient air, and (3) the fabrication processes to achieve highly efficient air-processed OHP solar cells. Finally, we will discuss the challenges and pathways toward commercialization of low-cost air-processed OHP solar cells.

Tunable internal quantum well alignment in rationally designed oligomer-based perovskite films deposited by resonant infrared matrix-assisted pulsed laser evaporation	MATERIALS HORIZONS			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; ENHANCED PHOSPHORESCENCE; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; CHARGE GENERATION; ENERGY-TRANSFER; EFFICIENT; TRANSPORT	Hybrid perovskites incorporating conjugated organic cations enable unusual charge carrier interactions among organic and inorganic structural components, but are difficult to prepare as films due to disparate component chemical/physical characteristics (e.g., solubility, thermal stability). Here we demonstrate that resonant infrared matrix-assisted pulsed laser evaporation (RIR-MAPLE) mitigates these challenges, enabling facile deposition of lead-halide-based perovskite films incorporating variable-length oligothiophene cations. Density functional theory (DFT) predicts suitable organic and inorganic moieties that form quantum-well-like structures with targeted luminescence or exciton separation/quenching. RIR-MAPLE-deposited films enable confirmation of these predictions by optical measurements, which further display excited state behavior transcending traditional quantum-well models-i.e., with appropriate selection of specially synthesized organic/inorganic moieties, intercomponent carrier transfer efficiently converts excitons from singlet to triplet states in organics for which intersystem crossing cannot ordinarily compete with recombination. These observations demonstrate the uniquely versatile excited-state behavior in hybrid perovskite quantum wells, and the value of integrating DFT, organic synthesis, RIR-MAPLE and spectroscopy for screening/preparing rationally devised complex structures.

However, the stability of PSCs is still a challenge due to the degradation of the perovskite layer caused by the high-energy ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Inspired by the luminescent down converting ability for UV blocking and conversion as well as energy transfer between suitable rare earth (RE) ions, a planar CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cell using Sm3+ and Eu3+ co-doped TiO2 electron transfer layer was designed. By optimizing the Sm3+ and Eu3+ doping concentration, the REs co-doped TiO2 ETL combines the advantages of high electron extraction and lower interfacial recombination caused by REs introduction, a power conversion efficiency of 19.01% was obtained. In addition, benefit from the enhanced ability to convert UV light into visible light of the co-doped ETL, the PSCs can sustain higher than at least 80% of the original efficiency over 25 days of full sunlight irradiation or after 100 h of UV illumination. Moreover, since the low-temperature pulsed laser deposition was adopted in ETL fabrication process, the large area (225 mm(2)) and flexibility devices were further explored, with PCEs of 12.60% and 15.48%, respectively. This work indicates that Sm3+ and Eu3+ co-doped ETLs are effective and promising method to enhance the photovoltaic performance and UV stability of PSCs, which can be further applied in other PSCs with different ETLs and co-doping types.

Enhanced power conversion efficiency and preferential orientation of the MAPbI(3) perovskite solar cells by introduction of urea as additive	ORGANIC ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Perovskite; Power conversion efficiency; Crystallization dynamics; Solar cells	HIGHLY EFFICIENT; PERFORMANCE; CRYSTALLIZATION; LIGHT; SIZE	In this investigation, urea (NH2CONH2) was added into the perovskite precursor solution with Pb(CH3COO)(3) as precursor. The effects of the urea content in the solution on the crystallization dynamics and the orientation of the perovskite films, and their photovoltaic properties were investigated. The results showed that the optimal annealing duration for the perovskite film increased with the urea content in the solution. An interaction between the urea and the source materials was observed. As a result, urea addition in the Pb(CH3COO)(3) based solution has an effect on the crystallization rate and the grain size of the perovskite phase. We found that the suitable amount of urea in the solution was beneficial for the formation of highly (110)-oriented perovskite films and this resulted in the corresponding solar cells with enhanced power conversion efficiency of nearly 17%.

The electronic structure, surface composition and morphology of perovskite film have been changed through the interaction between CsPbBr3 NCs and perovskite film. The band can be shifted upward by in incorporation of CsPbBr3 NCs and it is independent of the concentration of CsPbBr3 NCs. The surface component and its distribution can be adjusted by changing the concentration of CsPbBr3 NCs and the proper concentration of CsPbBr3 NCs would improve the stoichiometric ratio of perovskite film.

Implementing perovskites as the front cell requires an inverted (p-i-n) architecture; this architecture is particularly effective at harnessing high-energy photons and is compatible with ionic-dopant-free transport layers. Here, a power conversion efficiency of 21.6% is reported, the highest among inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Only by introducing a secondary amine into the perovskite structure to form MA(1-)(x)DMA(x)PbI(3) (MA is methylamine and DMA is dimethylamine) are defect density and carrier recombination suppressed to enable record performance. It is also found that the controlled inclusion of DMA increases the hydrophobicity and stability of films in ambient operating conditions: encapsulated devices maintain over 80% of their efficiency following 800 h of operation at the maximum power point, 30 times longer than reported in the best prior inverted PSCs. The unencapsulated devices show record operational stability in ambient air among PSCs.

The optical transparency and electric properties of DMD and its role as a top electrode of PSCs were studied by changing the thickness of the MoOx layer. Although the MoOx thickness was shown to have a negligible effect on the sheet resistance of DMD, the transmittance of visible light, selective carrier transport capability, and long-term stability of a device considerably depend on this factor. The sandwich structure of a 20-nm-thick MoOx, 7-nm-thick Ag, and 20-nm-thick MoOx exhibits a high transmittance and large photon-electron conversion rate of PSCs. In addition, PSCs using the DMD top electrode maintain 92% of their initial current density after 24 h of continuous operation owing to a UV light cut-off of the top illumination. Moreover, the overall structure of DMD blocks the diffusion of water and oxygen molecules from real environmental conditions. At the same time, the underlying/upper MoOx layer retards the degradation through a chemical reaction between Ag and the halide ions inside the cells, as well as foreign ions from outside the polluted atmosphere.

For commercial applications, these materials' requirements include easy synthesis, high hole mobility, and highly tuned and compatible electronic energy levels. Here, we present a systematic study of a recently discovered, easy-to-synthesize class of spiro[fluorene-9,9 '-xanthene]-based organic hole transport materials. Systematic side group functionalization allows us to control the HOMO energy and charge carrier mobility. Analysis of the bulk simulations enables us to derive design rules for mobility enhancement. We show that larger functional groups (e.g. methyl) decrease the conformational disorder due to steric effects and thus increase the hole mobility. Highly asymmetric or polar side groups (e.g. fluorine), however, increase the electrostatic disorder and thus reduce the hole mobility. These generally applicable design rules will help in the future to further optimize organic hole transport materials.

Sulfur-fused perylene diimide electron transport layers allow >400 h operational lifetime of methylammonium lead iodide photovoltaics	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							PEROVSKITE SOLAR-CELLS; RECENT PROGRESS; EFFICIENT; HALIDE; PHOTOLUMINESCENCE; PERFORMANCE; HYSTERESIS; STABILITY; FILMS	Hybrid organic inorganic perovskite (HOIP) semiconductors can be used to fabricate thin film solar cells with high solar power conversion efficiencies. The stability of HOIP solar cells depends strongly on the hole and electron transport layers that encapsulate the semiconductor and prevent reactions with metallic electrodes. A series of fused perylene diimide-based compounds with varying degrees of sulfur annulation (2PDI, 2PDI-2S, 2PDI-3S, and 2PDI-4S) were examined as electron transport layers in methyl ammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)) solar cells. The sulfur annulation alters not only the electron affinity of the ETL, but also the chemical interaction with the MAPbI(3) layer, resulting in unusually long lifetimes for this class of devices. Devices with 2PDI-4S, which contain two disulfide bridges, as an ETL show little degradation of the power conversion efficiency after 400 hours during solar illumination at the maximum power point, thus exceeding the performance of fullerene ETLs under long time operation.

Consequently, the small and large grains serve, respectively, as passivation agents and light-emitting centers, enabling self-passivation on the defects located on the surfaces of light-emitting large grains. Furthermore, the light-emitting states become linearly polarized with maximal polarization of 30.8%, demonstrating a very stable light emission (49,119 cd/m(2) with EQE = 11.31%) and a lower turn-on bias (1.9 V) than the bandgap (2.25V) in the perovskite LEDs (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbBr(3)/TPBi[50 nm]/LiF[0.7 nm]/Ag). Therefore, mixing large/small grains with the configuration of attaching small grains on the surfaces of large grains by mixing two precursor solutions presents a new strategy to develop high-performance perovskite LEDs.

It was demonstrated that the interfacial layer plays an important role in device performance of perovskite solar cells. In this study, we report utilization of a photoinitiation-crosslinked zwitterionic polymer, namely dextran with carboxybetaine modified by methacrylate (Dex-CB-MA), as an interfacial layer to improve the film morphology of the CH3NH3PbI3 photoactive layer and the interfacial contact between the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hole extraction layer and CH3NH3PbI3 photoactive layer. It is found that the Dex-CB-MA thin layer forms a better band alignment between the PEDOT:PSS hole extraction layer and CH3NH3PbI3 photoactive layer, and improves the crystallization of the CH3NH3PbI3 photoactive layer, resulting in efficient charge carrier transport. As a result, perovskite solar cells with the PEDOT:PSS/Dex-CB-MA hole extraction layer exhibit more than 30% enhancement in efficiency and dramatically boosted stability as compared with that with the PEDOT:PSS hole extraction layer. Our studies provide an effective and facile way to fabricate stable perovskite solar cells with high power conversion efficiency.

Herein, high-quality Cs(x)FA(1-x)PbI(3) perovskite films with different compositions (x = 0, 5, 10, and 15) are achieved by controlling the amount of cesium chloride (CsCl) in the respective FAPbI(3) precursor solution. The effects of CsCl addition on the morphological and optoelectronic properties of the resulting perovskite films and on the performance of the corresponding devices are systematically studied. Introduction of CsCl into FAPbI(3) shows a great potential to stabilize the alpha-FAPbI(3) perovskite phase by forming Cs(x)FA(1-x)PbI(3) films with improved morphology and carrier lifetimes. With an optimal 10 mol% CsCl additive, the average power conversion efficiency (PCE) is increased from 16.83 +/- 0.30% for the reference FAPbI(3)-based PSCs to 18.87 +/- 0.25% (with a steady-state PCE of 18.89%). Moreover, the optimized device performance is more stable after 20 days than the controlled one under approximate to 40% humidity in air.

There remain several great and lingering challenges to be addressed regarding device efficiency and stability. The photovoltaic efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) depends drastically on the charge-carrier dynamics. This complex process includes charge-carrier generation, extraction, transport and collection, each of which needs to be modulated in a favorable manner to achieve high performance. Two-dimensional materials (TDMs) including graphene and its derivatives, transition metal dichalcogenides (e.g., MoS2, WS2), black phosphorus (BP), metal nanosheets and two-dimensional (2D) perovskite active layers have attracted much attention for application in perovskite solar cells due to their high carrier mobility and tunable work function properties which greatly impact the charge carrier dynamics of PSCs. To date, significant advances have been achieved in the field of TDM-based PSCs. In this review, the recent progress in the development and application of TDMs (i.e., graphene, graphdiyne, transition metal dichalcogenides, BP, and others) as electrodes, hole transporting layers, electron transporting layers and buffer layers in PSCs is detailed. 2D perovskites as active absorber materials in PSCs are also summarized. The effect of TDMs and 2D perovskites on the charge carrier dynamics of PSCs is discussed to provide a comprehensive understanding of their optoelectronic processes. The challenges facing the PSC devices are emphasized with corresponding solutions to these problems provided with the overall goal of improving the efficiency and stability of photovoltaic devices.

Adsorption of Formic Acid on CH3NH3PbI3 Lead-Halide Organic-Inorganic Perovskites	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							INITIO MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; GENERALIZED GRADIENT APPROXIMATION; TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; AB-INITIO; SOLAR-CELLS; SURFACE; BEAM; DEGRADATION; KINETICS; ALKANES	The adsorption kinetics of formic acid (HCOOH) was studied under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) on lead-halide organic-inorganic perovskites (CH3NH3PbI3) supported on indium-doped tin oxide (ITO). The thin film samples were made at ambient pressure using the common liquid-phase synthesis, but samples were degassed under UHV. We studied real-world samples which do have some carbon impurities. Adsorption and decomposition kinetics were characterized with thermal desorption spectroscopy. Furthermore, samples' composition (including impurities) were inspected under UHV with Auger electron spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Accordingly, formic acid adsorbs molecularly at 100 K but decomposed above 600 K. On ITO or thermally decomposed perovskite samples, formic acid adsorbs only molecularly. The gas-phase species detected are consistent with a decomposition mechanism via the formation of formate (HCOO) and formyl (HCO) intermediates. The perovskite itself also decomposed thermally, but it is stabilized to some extent by the adsorbed formic acid. In addition, density functional theory calculations (DFT) were used to characterize the molecular adsorption pathway of HCOOH as well as the adsorption of various decomposition fragments. Accordingly, molecular formic acid adsorption is facilitated by a Pb-O bond formation between a 5-fold coordinated Pb atom on the surface of the perovskite and the carbonyl O atom of formic acid. Residual water and CO2, present due to the ambient pressure sample synthesis, stabilize molecular formic acid by forming a strong complex with water and weaker bonds with CO2.	[Nayakasinghe, M.

Here, PSCs with four different types of ETLs, such as SnO2, amorphous-Zn2SnO4 (am-ZTO), am-ZTO/SnO2, and SnO2/am-ZTO, are successfully synthesized. The interface recombination behavior and the charge transport properties of the devices affected by four types of ETLs are systematically investigated. For dual am-ZTO/SnO2 ETLs, compact am-ZTO ETL prepared by the pulsed laser deposition method provides a dense physical contact with FTO than the spin coating films, decreasing leakage current and improving charge collection at the interface of ETL/FTO. Moreover, dual am-ZTO/SnO2 ETLs lead to large free energy difference (Delta G), improving electron injection from perovskite to ETLs. One additional electron pathway from perovskite to am-ZTO is formed, which can also improve electron injection efficiency. A power conversion efficiency of 20.04% and a stabilized efficiency of 19.17% are achieved for the device based on dual am-ZTO/SnO2 ETLs. Most importantly, the devices are fabricated at a low temperature of 150 degrees C, which offers a potential method for large-scale production of PSCs, and paves the way for the development of flexible PSCs. It is believed that this work provides a strategy to design ETLs via controlling Delta G and interface contact to improve the performance of PSCs.

Despite intense research leading to increasing power conversion efficiency, a major problem concerning CsPbI3 lies in the long term stability and interconversion between different CsPbI3 polymorphs, a subject barely studied from the thermodynamic perspective. We report the formation enthalpies of two CsPbI3 polymorphs, alpha and delta CsPbI3 , using a combination of room temperature solution calorimetry in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and differential scanning calorimetry. We show that both polymorphs are stable with respect to their binary halides and confirm that the alpha-phase is a high temperature polymorph, metastable under ambient conditions. This work sheds light on patterns in polymorphism, possible decomposition reactions, materials stability, and compatibility within halide perovskites and related systems. Thermodynamic instability near ambient temperature of functional perovskites may be a general phenomenon related to their vibrational density of states.

Enabling Flexible All-Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells	JOULE			English	Article							LEAD HALIDE PEROVSKITES; IMPROVED STABILITY; PHOTOVOLTAICS; FORMAMIDINIUM	Multijunction all-perovskite solar cells offer a route toward efficiencies of III-V materials at low cost by combining the advantages of low thermalization loss in multijunction architectures with the beneficial properties of perovskitesnamely, low processing cost, high-throughput fabrication, and compatibility with flexible substrates. However, there are two main challenges for enabling high-efficiency tandems: (1) design of a recombination layer to efficiently combine two perovskite subcells while also preventing bottom cell damage during top cell processing and (2) achieving high open-circuit voltage of the widegap subcell. Herein, we overcome both of these challenges. First, we demonstrate a nucleation layer consisting of an ultra-thin polymer with nucleophilic hydroxyl and amine functional groups for nucleating a conformal, low-conductivity aluminum zinc oxide layer by atomic layer deposition (ALD). This method enables ALD-grown recombination layers that reduce shunting as well as solvent degradation from solution processing on top of existing perovskite active layers. Next, we demonstrate a band-gap tuning strategy based on A-site cations of mismatched size (dimethylammonium and cesium) to enable a 1.7 eV perovskite with high, stable voltages. By combining these advances, we fabricate two-terminal all-perovskite tandem solar cells with 23.1% power conversion efficiency on rigid substrates and 21.3% on flexible plastic substrates.

A TiO2 compact layer for the growth of TiO2 NR array via spin-coating cannot meet the requirements for efficient NR-based PSCs. Herein, we have developed and demonstrated the insertion of a bifunctional extrathinTiO(2) interlayer (5 nm) by atomic layer deposition (ALD) at the interface of the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/TiO2 compact layer to achieve alleviated electron exchange and a reduced energetic barrier. Thus, an accelerated extraction of electrons fromTiO(2) NR arrays via the compact layer and their transfer to the FTO substrate can improve the PSC efficiency. The thickness of the spin-coatedTiO(2) compact layer on the ALD-deposited TiO2 layer is spontaneously optimized. Finally, an outstanding efficiency of 20.28% has been achieved from a champion PSC with negligible hysteresis and high reliability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the superiority of TiO2 -NR-based PSCs withstanding the dry heat and thermal cycling tests. The results are of great importance for the preparation of efficient and durable PSCs for real-world applications.

However, their power-conversion efficiency (PCE) still lags behind that of the PSCs using hybrid halide perovskite and how to increase the corresponding PCE is still a challenge.

Through careful adjustments, a CsPbIBr2 film with a pure phase, full coverage, and high crystallinity with preferable (100) orientation was successfully obtained by introducing diethyl ether as the antisolvent followed by guanidinium surface passivation. The optimal CsPbIBr2 film was composed by a large grain with an average size of 950 nm, few grain boundaries, and higher hydrophobic property. Planer PSC using the optimal CsPbIBr2 film and electron-beam-deposited TiO2 compact layer exhibits a PCE of 9.17%, which ranks among the highest PCE range of the reported CsPbIBr2 PSCs. Besides, the designed CsPbIBr2 PSC exhibited good long-term stability, which could maintain 90% of the initial PCE in 40% humidity ambient, which remained constant after heat treatment at 100 degrees C for 100 h. Based on the optimal CsPbIBr2 film, the flexible and large-area (up to 225 mm(2)) PSCs were further fabricated. The adopted film improvement methods were further extended to other kinds of full-organic PSCs, which demonstrated the universality of this strategy.

In this study, high-performance perovskite solar cells with bulk heterojunction device structures where CH3NH3PbI2.55Br0.45 is blended with an n-type high-electron-mobility Zn2SnO4 nanoparticle as the photoactive layer are reported. Systematic studies indicate that the CH3NH3PbI2.55Br0.45:Zn2SnO4 bulk heterojunction thin film possesses enhanced and balanced charge carrier mobilities, superior film morphology with enlarged crystal sizes, and suppressed trap density. Photoluminescence and time-resolved photoluminescence studies further demonstrate that there is an efficient photoinduced charge carrier transfer between CH3NH3PbI2.55Br0.45 and Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles. Thus, bulk heterojunction perovskite solar cells by the CH3NH3PbI2.55Br0.45:Zn2SnO4. thin film exhibit over 21.07% power conversion efficiency, which is more than 12% enhancement as compared to that (18.74%) observed from planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells by the pristine CH3NH3PbI2:55Br0.45 thin film. Moreover, bulk heterojunction perovskite solar cells possess significantly suppressed photocurrent hysteresis, dramatically enhanced device stability, and reproducibility. All these results demonstrate that high-performance perovskite solar cells can be realized through bulk heterojunction device structures.

These compounds have the same structure except for the ester substituent, which was varied from methyl to phenyl to thienyl and to pyridyl. The three latter derivatives performed better than PC61BM in PSCs, mainly attributed to the specific interactions of the fullerenes with the perovskite layer, as evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (SS- and TRPL) measurements. The experimental results were fully supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which showed that the strongest interactions were exhibited by the compound possessing the pyridyl substituent.

Extending light absorption beyond 800 nm into the NIR should increase photocurrent generation and further improve photovoltaic efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a simple and facile approach is reported to incorporate a NIR-chromophore that is also a Lewis-base into perovskite absorbers to broaden their photoresponse and increase their photovoltaic efficiency. Compared with pristine PSCs without such an organic chromophore, these solar cells generate photocurrent in the NIR beyond the band edge of the perovskite active layer alone. Given the Lewis-basic nature of the organic semiconductor, its addition to the photoactive layer also effectively passivates perovskite defects. These films thus exhibit significantly reduced trap densities, enhanced hole and electron mobilities, and suppressed illumination-induced ion migration. As a consequence, perovskite solar cells with organic chromophore exhibit an enhanced efficiency of 21.6%, and substantively improved operational stability under continuous one-sun illumination. The results demonstrate the potential generalizability of directly incorporating a multifunctional organic semiconductor that both extends light absorption and passivates surface traps in perovskite active layers to yield highly efficient and stable NIR-harvesting PSCs.

Interface studies by simulation on methylammonium lead iodide based planar perovskite solar cells for high efficiency	SOLAR ENERGY			English	Article						Perovskite solar cells; Interface engineering; Energy band alignment; High efficiency; CH3NH3PbI3; Absorber band gap	CHARGE-TRANSPORT; PERFORMANCE; PARAMETERS; MORPHOLOGY; SCAFFOLD; LIGHT; BAND	Perovskite solar cells gained importance in the recent years due to high power conversion efficiency and low-cost fabrication methods. Suitable solar cell properties can be obtained by fine tuning process parameters. Charge transport, optical band gap of perovskite absorber and energy band discontinuity on either side of absorber are an important factor in determining cell efficiency. In this work, theoretical studies on cell efficiency were performed as a function of absorber band gap since it determines band discontinuity. Band alignment investigation was performed to minimize band discontinuity between interfaces. Our results show that, valance band discontinuity at HTL/absorber interface (Delta E-v1) increases from 0.01 eV to 0.42 eV as the absorber band gap increases from 1.20 eV to 1.65 eV. On the other hand, valance band discontinuity at absorber/ETL interface (Delta E-v2) decreases from 2.07 eV to 1.62 eV. Conduction band discontinuity on both sides of absorber interface is almost constant and independent of absorber band gap. The increase in Delta E-v1 restricts holes collection which in turn affects cell efficiency. Depending upon Delta E-v1, cell efficiency increased from 24.96% to 29.40% and then decreased to 26.27%. This is due to the fact that maximum acceptable limit for Delta E-v1 is 0.20 eV and holes can reach back electrode when Delta E-v1 <= 0.20 eV. For the absorber band gap of 1.40 eV with Delta E-v1 of 0.17 eV, a high efficiency of 29.40% has been obtained with J(sc) of 28.70 mA/cm(2), V-oc, of 1.24 V, and FF of 82.60%.

However, two major issues of: (i) Structural ambient stability, and (ii) Toxicity, caused by the presence of Pb content, are the pivotal obstacles for the commercialization of environmental friendly PSC. In this regard, we are introducing a highly ambient stable PSC through the incorporation of barium (Ba) with successful ultrashort annealing through intense pulsed light (IPL). The ambient stability of Ba doped perovskite thin films was explored in the humidity range of 35-68%. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of fabricated devices were found to be 8.99, 7.39, 6.94, 6.60, 5.98 and 3.82% for pristine, 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 mol% Ba doping, respectively. Afterwards, fabricated devices were kept in ambient environment under dark for 20 days. With systematic photovoltaic analysis, it was observed that the 2.0 mol% Ba doped PSC exhibited 8.0% efficiency drop (from 6.94 to 6.38%), whereas the PCE of pristine based devices decreased from 8.99 to 2.60%, demonstrating an almost 71.0% drop. Our photovoltaic results demonstrated a great improvement within the ambient stability of PSC without any encapsulation which can indicate Ba doping as highly promising approach for the fabrication of PSC with higher ambient stability.

The distinctive variety of electronic, optical, and magnetic properties (i.e., accessible electronic transitions, high dielectric constants, wide bandgaps, tunable electrical and thermal conductivities) often encountered in metal oxides are clearly due to the unique nature of their outer d-electrons. Given all conceivable metal oxide combinations, we may find that it is possible to yield structures with unique metallic (i.e., ReO3, RuO2, LaNiO3), semiconducting (i.e., ZnO, TiO2), and insulating (i.e., BaTiO3, Al2O3, SiO2) properties. Strongly correlated metal oxides may also undergo metal-to-insulator phase transitions (i.e., V2O3, VO2, La1-xSrxVO3) which allow us to further tune their electronic properties. Strongly correlated metal oxides may also demonstrate charge density wave (i.e., K0.3MoO3), defect ordering (i.e., Ca2Mn2O5, Ca2Fe2O5), ferromagnetism (i.e., Fe3O4, CrO2, La0.5Sr0.5MnO3), and antiferromagnetism (i.e., NiO, LaCrO3) properties. Given their versatile optical and electronic activity, metal oxides have been extensively investigated as key components in optics, electrochemistry, photocatalysis, plasmonics, and photovoltaics. Understanding the structural, morphological, and optoelectronic properties of either naturally occurring or synthetically fabricated metal oxides provides a pathway for the development of novel metal oxides with properties that can be tuned to fulfill the efficiency demands of a particular application. Here, we present a comprehensive review of the synthesis, characterization tools, and applications of metal oxide nanostructures and their thin films. We will also discuss the synthesis, characterization, and applications of metal oxide heterostructures. We have wittingly narrowed the scope of this review to only include the use of metal oxides for energy conversion applications. Finally, we will provide our fair assessment on the outlook, challenges, and opportunities we foresee in metal oxides research and applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Light-Induced Defect Generation in CH3NH3PbI3 Thin Films and Single Crystals	SOLAR RRL			English	Article						CH3NH3PbI3; light-induced defect generation; low temperature; perovskite; single crystal	PEROVSKITE SOLAR-CELLS; METHYLAMMONIUM LEAD IODIDE; EFFICIENT	In a period of only a few years, the power conversion efficiency of organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells has surpassed a value of 24.2%. However, a major drawback is the lack of long-term stability, which is partially related to the dissociation of organic cations under prolonged illumination. This degradation mechanism is not limited to ambient temperatures. At low temperatures (T = 5 K), illumination of methyl ammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) thin films with a photon energy of E-ph = 3.4 eV results in the formation of localized trap states located about 100 meV within the bandgap. These light-induced defects are metastable, and annealing at T >= 15 K removes the localized states. Defect creation is not limited to polycrystalline perovskites but is also observed in single-crystal CH3NH3PbI3. The experimental data are discussed in terms of a two-level model where the metastable state is separated from the annealed state by an energy barrier.

Improved performance of inverted perovskite solar cells due to the incorporation of zirconium acetylacetonate buffer layer	SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS			English	Article						Perovskite; Alcohol-soluble; Cathode-buffer layer	EFFICIENT; OXIDE	We demonstrated the use of an additional cathode layer of zirconium acetylacetonate (ZAC) prepared in IPA for Perovskite solar cells (PSC) and achieved a power conversion efficiency of 15.2%, which is about 25% higher when compared to a control device with only PCBM. Our results indicated that IPA was the best alcohol-based solvent to obtain a smooth film and also prevented any corrosion of the underlying layers. We investigated the surface effects of adding the layer and also realized an optimized concentration of 1.5 mg/ml was best for device efficiency as well as reduced the RMS to 3 nm. Dark-current time-resolved photoluminescence measurements were used to understand the effect of the thickness and concentration of the ZAC layer on the performance of the device.

J	Zhou, X; Wang, YY; Li, CY; Wu, T				Zhou, Xue; Wang, Yanying; Li, Chunya; Wu, Tsunghsueh			Doping amino-functionalized ionic liquid in perovskite crystal for enhancing performances of hole-conductor free solar cells with carbon electrode	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL			English	Article						Ionic liquid; Perovskite; Solar cell; Carbon electrode	EFFICIENT; CRYSTALLIZATION; STABILITY	Amino group functionalized hydrophobic ionic liquid, 1-ethylamine hydrobromide-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (ILPF6) ionic liquid, was employed as the functional monomer to fabricate a carbon-based hole-conductor-free perovskite solar cells with high performances. The photoactive perovskite layer was facilely acquired by one-step spin-coating the precursor solution on a TiO2/FTO electrode surface, and subsequently annealed at an initial annealing at 60 degrees C for 3 min followed by annealing at 100 degrees C for 10 min to crystallize. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by mixing ILPF6 ionic liquid and methylammonium iodide with an equal molar ratio of PbI2. In the optimized conditions, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) was enhanced from 10.08% to 13.01% by doping ILPF6 into the perovskite crystal film. This study demonstrates the multifaceted functions of ILPF6 ionic liquid in improving the efficiency and stability of PSCs. First, ILPF6 can react with PbI2 to form perovskite and can also play a role of the controlling and crosslinking reagent to obtain large grain size and minimize defects. Secondly, ILPF6 can improve the loading amount of perovskite crystals on the TiO2 film. Third, ILPF6 can promote the transport rate of the photogenerated carriers in the perovskite crystal layer. Lastly, ILPF6 ionic liquid with its high hydrophobicity creates a moisture barrier to improve the stability of PSCs effectively. The PSCs were stored under dark in a low relative humidity atmosphere (RH of 20%) at 25 degrees C without sealing. After 840 h, the PSC can maintain 94% of its initial PCE under the identical intensity illumination. This study demonstrates an excellent strategy to break through the bottleneck of the traditional PSCs and the enhanced effect of ionic liquid for carbon-based PSCs.

Here, we investigated the interfacial charge transfer and diffusion in the CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM film by ultrafast transient absorption (TA) and transient reflection (TR) spectroscopies. A subpicosecond CT coupled with carrier diffusion and hot carrier cooling is observed, which is almost independent of temperature. It is also found that the interfacial CT is slowed down to 11 ps in a thinner perovskite film. A diffusion-based model is further built to fit the TR dynamics, and we find that the more significant surface recombination in thinner films can compete with interfacial CT, which lowers CT efficiency.

This study presents a fundamental step-by-step systematic analysis of the deposition of a rather complex molecule, the [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), with seemingly infinite orientational configurations, on the (110) surface of methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) perovskite in a solvated environment. We employed the adaptive biasing force (ABF) method in conjunction with classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to determine the potential of mean force (PMF) and corresponding configurations of deposited PCBM in the presence of chlorobenzene (CB) and vacuum. Our calculations underscore the impact of solvent on the energetics of deposition and the resulting configurations of deposited PCBM. In the presence of solvent, the most energetically favorable configuration occurs when the carbonyl oxygen (CO) of PCBM is attached with a Pb atom of perovskite surface with the fullerene (C60) pointing away from the surface. The corresponding binding energy between PCBM and perovskite is 12.9 kcal/mol at 325 K and increases with increasing temperature. In contrast, in a vacuum, the most energetically favorable configuration occurs when both C60 moiety and the CO atom of PCBM are associated with the perovskite surface resulting in a stronger binding energy of 23.6 kcal/mol due to the absence of solvent screening. We investigated the different energetic contributions that govern the overall deposition process. In solvated systems, the deposited configurations are stabilized primarily by entropic contribution due to loss of solvent structure around both perovskite surface and PCBM during deposition.

Now that lab-fabricated perovskite devices rival the efficiency of silicon PVs, the next challenge of scalable mass manufacturing of large perovskite PV panels remains to be solved. For that purpose, it is still unclear which manufacturing method will provide the lowest processing cost and highest quality solar cells. Vapor deposition has been proven to work well for perovskites as a controllable and repeatable thin-film deposition technique but with processing speeds currently too slow to adequately lower the production costs. Addressing this challenge, in the present work, we demonstrate a high-speed vapor transport processing technique in a custom-built reactor that produces high-quality perovskite films with unprecedented deposition speed exceeding 1 nm/s, over 10x faster than previous vapor deposition demonstrations. We show that the semiconducting perovskite films produced with this method have excellent crystallinity and optoelectronic properties with 10 ns charge carrier lifetime, enabling us to fabricate the first photovoltaic devices made by perovskite vapor transport deposition. Our experiments are guided by computational fluid dynamics simulations that also predict that this technique could lead to deposition rates on the order of micrometers per second. This, in turn, could enable cost-effective scalable manufacturing of the perovskite-based solar technologies.

However, it is extremely difficult to prepare a pure alpha-FAPbI(3) phase because of its easy transformation into a nondesirable delta-FAPbI(3) phase. In the present study, a "perovskite" template (MAPbI(3)-FAI-PbI2-DMSO) structure is used to avoid and suppress the formation of delta-FAPbI(3) phases. The perovskite structure is formed via postdeposition involving the treatment of colloidal MAI-PbI2-DMSO film with FAI before annealing. In situ X-ray diffraction in vacuum shows no detectable delta-FAPbI(3) phase during the whole synthesis process when the sample is annealed from 100 to 180 degrees C. This method is found to reduce defects at grain boundaries and enhance the film quality as determined by means of photoluminescence mapping and Kelvin probe force microscopy. The perovskite solar cells (PSCs) fabricated by this method demonstrate a much-enhanced short-circuit current density ( J(sc)) of 24.99 mA cm(-2) and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.24%, which is the highest efficiency reported for pure FAPbI(3), with great stability under 800 h of thermal ageing and 500 h of light soaking in nitrogen.

However, poor thermal stability of perovskites on ZnO and interfacial traps introduced during processing are obstacles to achieve a good device performance. Here, we demonstrate perovskite solar cells using aluminum doped zinc oxide (AZO) nanoparticles for the ETL having a better thermal stability compared with ZnO. However, the device shows a lower short circuit current density and a large photocurrent hysteresis, which are attributed to the poor interfacial properties between the ETL and the perovskite layer. To address this issue, a thin interfacial modification layer of phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) was employed. The resulting device shows the efficiency is improved from 13 to 17% along with a significant reduction in hysteresis. Results from our thermal admittance spectroscopy show that the interface defect states are significantly reduced with the PCBM passivation layer.

J	Zhang, JZ				Zhang, Jin Zhong			A "Cocktail" Approach to Effective Surface Passivation of Multiple Surface Defects of Metal Halide Perovskites Using a Combination of Ligands	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article							LIGHT-EMITTING-DIODES; SOLAR-CELLS; IMPROVED STABILITY; ANION-EXCHANGE; QUANTUM DOTS; NANOCRYSTALS; FILMS; BR; CL; PHOTOLUMINESCENCE	Surface passivation of metal halide perovskites (MHPs) is essential for their stability and various properties as well as functionalities, including optical and electronic. Passivation is important for both stabilizing intrinsic defects and preventing extrinsic damaging species from reaching the perovskite (PVK), such as water and oxygen. Because of the ternary nature of their chemical composition, multiple surface defects exist for both bulk and nanostructured PVKs, with the latter particularly prominent because of their extremely large surface-to-volume ratio. To effectively passivate the different surface defects, a multitude of different ligands are necessary because each type of defect likely requires a different ligand for optimal passivation, as has been successfully demonstrated in a number of systems in essentially a "cocktail" approach. Characteristics of the ligands that affect effectiveness of passivation include size, shape, charge and charge distribution, orientation, conductivity, and interligand interaction. Examples of ligands for MHPs include both cationic and anionic or zwitterionic species with varied valences. The challenge is to identify the most effective ligand for each type of defect, and addressing this will require further experimental and theoretical study.

J	Shang, QY; Piercy, BD; Losego, MD; Lian, TQ				Shang, Qiongyi; Piercy, Brandon D.; Losego, Mark D.; Lian, Tianquan			Effect of Surface Ligand on Charge Separation and Recombination at CsPbI3 Perovskite Quantum Dot/TiO2 Interfaces	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							LEAD HALIDE PEROVSKITES; ULTRAFAST ELECTRON-TRANSFER; RU POLYPYRIDYL COMPLEXES; ANION-EXCHANGE; NANOCRYSTALS; EFFICIENCY; INJECTION; DOTS; BR; CL	CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dot (QD) solar cells are a promising device platform for further development due to their improved stability compared to bulk materials. The fabrication of these devices often involves postsynthetic washing of colloidal QDs to remove surface ligands. Herein, we investigate how this postsynthetic treatment affects the charge separation (CS) and charge recombination (CR) processes at the interface of CsPbI3 QDs and the TiO2 electron extraction layer. The CS time constant at QD/TiO2 interface decrease from 457 +/- 4 ps for QDs directly deposited on TiO2 to 288 +/- 1 ps for QDs that were washed twice by methyl acetate, increasing the ET efficiency from 89.9 +/- 0.3% to 98.3 +/- 0.01%. Interestingly, this treatment also lengthens the average charge recombination time constants from 346 +/- 18 ns to 1180 +/- 60 ns, which is also beneficial for reducing charge recombination loss. This result demonstrates the pronounced effect of QD washing by methyl acetate (MeOAc) on interfacial charge transfer processes, suggesting the important effect of postsynthesis modification of colloidal perovskite QDs on solar cell efficiencies.

The integration of two different functional groups (i.e., formyl and amino groups) in one simple pyrene molecule affords a bifunctional building block: 1,6-bis(4-formylphenyl)-3,8-bis(4-aminophenyl)pyrene (BFBAPy). Highly crystalline and porous Py-COFs can be easily prepared by the self-condensation of BFBAPy in various solvents, such as CH2Cl2, CHCl3, tetrahydrofuran, methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, and dimethylacetamide, etc. The current work, to the best of our knowledge, is a rare case of COF synthesis that exhibits excellent solvent adaptability. Highly crystalline Py-COF thin films have been facilely fabricated on various substrates and exhibit potential applications in hole transporting layers for perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, the versatility of this two-in-one strategy was also verified by two additional examples. The current work dramatically reduces the difficulty of COF synthesis, and such two-in-one strategy is anticipated to be applicable for the synthesis of other COFs constructed by different building blocks and linkages.

Impact of Titanium Dioxide Surface Defects on the Interfacial Composition and Energetics of Evaporated Perovskite Active Layers	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						hybrid perovskite; vacuum deposition; stoichiometry; titanium dioxide; surface defects; defect passivation; interface chemistry; energetics	SOLAR-CELLS; PHOTOELECTRON-SPECTROSCOPY; ADSORPTION; ENERGY; PHASE; STOICHIOMETRY; DEGRADATION; EFFICIENT; ALIGNMENT; TIO2	This investigation elucidates critical Bronsted and Lewis acid-base interactions at the titanium dioxide (TiO2) surface that control the interfacial composition and, thus, the energetics of vacuum-processed methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)) perovskite active layers (PALs). In situ photoelectron spectroscopy analysis shows that interfacial growth, chemical composition, and energetics of co-deposited methylammonium iodide (MAI)/PbI2 thin films are significantly different on bare and (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES)-functionalized TiO2 surfaces. Mass spectroscopy analysis indicates that MAI dissociates into hydrogen iodide and methylamine in the gas phase and suggests that MAPbI(3) nucleation is preceded by adsorption and coupling of these volatile MAI precursors. Prior to MAPbI(3) nucleation on the bare TiO2 surface, we suggest that high coverages of methylamine adsorbed to surface defect sites (e.g., undercoordinated Ti atoms and hydroxyls) promote island-like growth of large, PbI2-rich nuclei that inhibit nucleation and lead to a thick substoichiometric interface layer that impedes charge transport and collection energetics. APTES functional groups passivate TiO2 surface defects and facilitate more conformal growth of small, PbI2-rich nuclei that enhance MAPbI(3) nucleation and significantly improve interfacial energetics for charge transport and extraction. This work highlights the considerable influence of TiO2 surface chemistry on PAL composition and energetics, which are critical factors that impact the performance and long stability of these materials in emerging photovoltaic device technologies.

Increasing the crystal grain size in perovskite films is an effective method to reduce the trap-state density. Here, we have added NH4SCN into perovskite precursor solution to obtain perovskite films with an increased crystal grain size. The perovskite with increased crystal grain size shows a much lower trap-state density compared with reference perovskite films, resulting in an improved photovoltaic performance in PSCs. The champion photovoltaic device has achieved a power conversion efficiency of 19.36%. The proposed method may also impact other optoelectronic devices based on perovskite films.

To avoid the weakness of using only scientific papers or patents to study the development trends of emerging technologies, this paper proposes a framework that uses scientific papers and patents as data resources and integrates the text mining and expert judgment approaches to identify technology evolution paths and forecast technology development trends within the short term. The perovskite solar cell technology is selected as a case study. In this case, the text mining and expert judgment methods are applied to analyze the technology evolution path, and gaps analysis between science and technology is used to forecast the technology development trend. This paper will contribute to the technology forecasting and foresight methodology, and will be of interest to solar photovoltaic technology R&D experts.

The present work demonstrates the oxidation states of perovskite layers formed by (i) one-step deposition, (ii) solvent-to-solvent extraction, (iii) hot casting, and (iv) mixed-cation solution processing. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is used to investigate the compositional changes due to oxygen, and the spectra confirm the diffusion of oxygen in the perovskite layer. Mixed-cation perovskites show the most promising results among the four deposition techniques. The best photovoltaic performance is achieved by an SnO2-based mixed-cation perovskite solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of 18.75%. A power conversion efficiency of 16.74% is obtained by a TiO2-based mixed-cation perovskite solar cell when the optimum thickness of the TiO2 blocking layer is 60-65 nm.

In this work, we studied the effect of Mg doping on CuCrO2 (CCO) nanoparticles and their performance as HTLs in OSCs and PSCs. CCO and Mg doped CCO (Mg:CCO) nanoparticles were hydrothermally synthesized. The nanoparticles were characterized by various experimental techniques to study the effect of Mg doping on structural, chemical, morphological, optical, and electronic properties of CCO. We found that Mg doping increases work function and decreases particle size. We demonstrate CCO and Mg:CCO as efficient HTLs in a variety of OSCs, including the first demonstration of a non-fullerene acceptor bulk heterojunction, and CH3NH3PbI3 PSCs. A small improvement of average short-circuit current density with Mg doping was found in all systems.	[Zhang, Boya; Thampy, Sampreetha; Xu, Weijie; Hsu, Julia W.

Using a time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) study, this work explores the role that the central organic cation plays in defining the optoelectronic and physical properties of metal perovskites. Cubic phases of CH3NH3PbI3, CH3NH3PbCl3, CH3NH3PbICl2, and CH3NH3PbI2Cl perovskite structures are investigated using TDDFT with Gaussian 16. Electronic and optical properties, including transition energy, band gap, IR and absorption spectra and vibrational frequencies are examined. It is observed that the organic cation reduces the unit cell volume of the outer metal halide structure from approximately 9-20% for different perovskite materials. The peak optical absorption also correspondingly decreases by a significant margin, ranging from about 40-60%.

Herein, it is reported that using the block copolymer F127 as the passivation reagent in conjunction with the solvent annealing process can efficiently improve the performance and stability of corresponding organic-inorganic PSCs. It is anticipated that the hydrophilic poly(ethylene oxide) tails of F127 polymers connect with contiguous perovskite crystals and passivate defects at perovskite grain boundaries, whereas the dangling hydrophobic poly(phenyl oxide) centers suppress perovskite decomposition caused by moisture and heat. After the optimization of the F127 additive, planar PSCs with champion power conversion efficiencies of 21.01% and 18.71% are achieved on rigid and flexible substrates, respectively. The F127 passivation strategy provides an effective approach for fabricating high-efficiency and stable PSCs.

The rapid advancement in PSCs technology is because of favorable properties of perovskite materials and addition of charge selective layers. Here, we report lithium-doped SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL) to improve electrons extraction from the perovskite absorbing layer. The lithium-doped SnO2 not only shows relatively higher conductivity, reduced oxygen-deficient regions, improved oxidation state, but also induces a larger grain size of perovskite films. This leads to an improvement in all related photovoltaic parameters of the methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)) planar heterojunction PSCs. The champion device yields a power conversion efficiency of 19.09%. The simple solution and lower annealing processed ETLs are compatible with almost all substrates used in PSCs and other perovskite-based devices.

Carrier-gas assisted vapor deposition for highly tunable morphology of halide perovskite thin films	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS			English	Article							OPEN-CIRCUIT VOLTAGE; SOLAR-CELLS; GRAIN-BOUNDARIES; EFFICIENT; PERFORMANCE; GROWTH; RECOMBINATION; MECHANISMS; MOBILITIES; UNIFORM	We demonstrate carrier-gas assisted vapor deposition (CGAVD) as a promising synthesis technique for high-quality metal halide perovskite thin films. Wide tunability of film microstructure and morphology are accesible with CGAVD via the combination of several independently controllable experimental variables. Here, we examine in detail the material transport mechanisms in CGAVD and develop analytical expressions for deposition rates for the halide perovskite precursors MABr, MAI, SnBr2, and SnI2 as a function of experimentally tunable temperatures, pressures, and flow rates. The method is then applied to systematically control the growth of MASnBr(3) thin films via co-deposition across a range of stoichiometries and morphologies. In varying source material temperature, carrier gas flow rate, dilution gas flow rate, substrate temperature, and chamber pressure, corresponding changes are realized in the degree of crystallinity, grain orientation, and average grain size (from similar to 0.001 to >0.7 mu m(2)). Thin films of MASnI(3) and MASnBr(3) deposited using CGAVD show resistivities of 0.6 omega cm and 7 x 10(4) omega cm, respectively, broadly consistent with previous reports.

Beyond single junction devices, low-temperature solution processability, and bandgap tenability make the metal halide perovskites ideal candidates for fabricating tandem solar cells. Tandem solar cells combining a wide-bandgap perovskite top cell and a low-bandgap bottom cell based on mixed tin (Sn)-lead (Pb) perovskite or a dissimilar material such as silicon (Si) or copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) offer an extraordinary opportunity to achieve PCEs higher than Shockley-Queisser (SQ) radiative efficiency limits (similar to 33%) for single junction cells. In this review, we will summarize recent research progress on the fabrication of wide- (1.7 to 1.9 eV) and low-bandgap (1.1 to 1.3 eV) perovskite single-junction cells and their applications in tandem cells. Key challenges and issues in wide- and low-bandgap single-junction cells will be discussed. We will survey current state-of-the-art perovskite tandem cells and discuss the limitations and challenges for perovskite tandem cells. Lastly, we conclude with an outlook for the future development of perovskite tandem solar cells.

Here, we report that MAPbI(3-x)Cl(x)-based photodetectors (PDs) show a response in the ultraviolet spectrum as well as yield very fast photoresponse speed (<80 mu s/90 mu s) and excellent detectivity (10(12) Jones with 365nm lamp) with very low driving voltage (0.3V). The results demonstrate the enhancement of photoelectric performance of the PDs in the ultraviolet spectrum is because the doping of Cl in MAPbI(3) increases the bandgap and the crystalline grain size of MAPbI(3-x)Cl(x) film. Moreover, 10%PbCl2-MAPbI(3-x)Cl(x)-based flexible photodetectors displays remarkable mechanical flexibility.

J	Yao, Z; Qu, DL; Guo, YX; Huang, H				Yao, Zhuo; Qu, Dianli; Guo, Yuxiang; Huang, Hong			Flexible, stable and indium-free perovskite solar cells using solution-processed transparent graphene electrodes	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article							EFFICIENT; LAYERS; STABILITY; FILM	With the dramatic advances in performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in the recent years, the flexible PSCs have triggered huge attention to distributed generation. Due to the fragility of traditional indium-based transparent electrodes, the alternatives such as graphene have been widely investigated and used in the flexible devices. However, the lack of a solution-processed method to prepare large-area and low-cost graphene electrode limits the future production via the roll-to-roll process. Here, with the assistance of ethyl cellulose, we demonstrate a highly dispersed graphene composite transparent electrode which satisfies the demand of conductivity and transmittance for flexible PSCs. Moreover, the excellent mechanical flexibility and diffusive transmittance of the graphene electrode show a great improvement in flexible PSCs, resulting in a best efficiency of 15.71%. With this strategy, the solution-processed G:EC could greatly reduce the cost of electrode in wearable and foldable electronics. The G:EC shows promising possibility to replace the indium-based transparent electrodes in the future.

However, power conversion efficiency of carbon-based CsPbBr3 perovskite solar cells is still unsatisfactory up to now, as the direct contact of the CsPbBr3 with carbon is plagued with interfacial recombination sites and undesirable hole extraction barrier. Here, we report an effective strategy that employs poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) to modify the CsPbBr3/carbon interface in carbon-based CsPbBr3 perovskite solar cells and enable higher efficiency. The systematic tests and analyses demonstrate that the P3HT interlayer can remarkably suppress the charge recombination and enhance the hole extraction capability via formation of favorable energy level alignment between CsPbBr3 film and carbon electrode, and passivation of the surface defect states of CsPbBr3 film. As a result, the carbon-based CsPbBr3 perovskite solar cell with P3HT interlayer achieves a high conversion efficiency of 6.49%, exhibiting an increase by 27% compared to pristine device. Moreover, the carbon-based CsPbBr3 perovskite solar cells with P3HT interlayer exhibits excellent stability in ambient air with almost no change in the power conversion efficiency of the unsealed device over 40 days.

The tolerance factor has limited the choice of cations (A) in 3D lead iodide perovskites (APbI(3)), an intriguing class of semiconductors for high-performance photovoltaics and optoelectronics. Here, we show the tolerance factor requirement is relaxed in 2D Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) perovskites, enabling the incorporation of a variety of larger cations beyond the methylammonium (MA), formamidinium, and cesium ions in the lead iodide perovskite cages for the first time. This is unequivocally confirmed with the single-crystal X-ray structure of newly synthesized guanidinium (GA)-based (n-C6H13NH3)(2) (GA)Pb2I7, which exhibits significantly enlarged and distorted perovskite cage containing sterically constrained GA cation. Structural comparison with (n-C6H13NH3)(2) (MA)Pb2I7 reveals that the structural stabilization originates from the mitigation of strain accumulation and self-adjustable strain-balancing in 2D RP structures. Furthermore, spectroscopic studies show a large A cation significantly influences carrier dynamics and exciton-phonon interactions through modulating the inorganic sublattice. These results enrich the diverse families of perovskite materials, provide new insights into the mechanistic role of A-site cations on their physical properties, and have implications to solar device studies using engineered perovskite thin films incorporating such large organic cations.

The efficiency improvement in the perovskite cells is related to repeated recycling between photons and electron-hole pairs, reduced recombination losses, and increased carrier lifetimes. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach toward augmenting the perovskite solar cell efficiency by invoking the Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) mechanism. FRET occurs in the near-field region as the bacteriorhodopsin (bR) protein, and perovskite has similar optical gaps. Titanium dioxide functionalized with the bR protein is shown to accelerate the electron injection from excitons produced in the perovskite layer. FRET predicts the strength of long-range excitonic transport between the perovskite and bR layers. Solar cells incorporating TiO2/bR layers are found to exhibit much higher photovoltaic performance as compared to baseline cells without bR. These results open the opportunity to develop a new class of bioperovskite solar cells with improved performance and stability.

Mitigating Measurement Artifacts in TOF-SIMS Analysis of Perovskite Solar Cells	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						TOF-SIMS; PSC; HPSC; cation migration; interface; interface chemistry; passivating additive; degradation	ION MIGRATION	Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) is one of the few techniques that can specifically distinguish between organic cations such as methylammonium and formamidinium. Distinguishing between these two species can lead to specific insight into the origins and evolution of compositional inhomogeneity and chemical gradients in halide perovskite solar cells, which appears to be a key to advancing the technology. TOF-SIMS can obtain chemical information from hybrid organic- inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in up to three dimensions, while not simply splitting the organic components into their molecular constituents (C, H, and N for both methylammonium and formamidinium), unlike other characterization methods. Here, we report on the apparently ubiquitous A-site organic cation gradient measured when doing TOF-SIMS depth-profiling of PSC films. Using thermomechanical methods to cleave perovskite samples at the buried glass/transparent conducting oxide interface enables depth profiling in a reverse direction from normal depth profiling (backside depth profiling). When comparing the backside depth profiles to the traditional front side profiled devices, an identical slight gradient in the A-site organic cation signal is observed in each case. This indicates that the apparent A-site cation gradient is a measurement artifact due to beam damage from the primary ion beam causing a continually decreasing ion yield for secondary ions of methylammonium and formamidinium. This is due to subsurface implantation and bond breaking from the 30 keV bismuth primary ion beam impact when profiling with too high of a data density. Here, we show that the beam-generated artifact associated with this damage can mostly be mitigated by altering the measurement conditions. We also report on a new method of depth profiling applied to PSC films that enables enhanced sensitivity to halide ions in positive measurement polarity, which can eliminate the need for a second measurement in negative polarity in most cases.

In this essay, three important questions are explored: Do GBs affect: 1) recombination and thus open-circuit voltage? Not dramatically, if at all; 2) current-voltage hysteresis? Most studies show that hysteresis is dominated by defects at GBs; and 3) long-term durability? Yes, GBs definitely help increase the rate of perovskite degradation.

Remarkably, the optoelectronic properties of HOIP are tunable by changing the chemical components of their building blocks. Recently, the HOIP spintronic properties and their applications in spintronic devices have attracted substantial interest. Here the impact of the chemical component diversity in HOIPs on their spintronic properties is studied. Spin valve devices based on HOIPs with different organic cations and halogen atoms are fabricated. The spin diffusion length is obtained in the various HOIPs by measuring the giant magnetoresistance (GMR) response in spin valve devices with different perovskite interlayer thicknesses. In addition spin lifetime is also measured from the Hanle response. It is found that the spintronic properties of HOIPs are mainly determined by the halogen atoms, rather than the organic cations. The study provides a clear avenue for engineering spintronic devices based on HOIPs.

In this work, the effect of an external force in different directions on the photocurrent of a lateral structure of an indium tin oxide (ITO)-MAPbI(3)-ITO photodetector is investigated. The photodetector is fabricated by using the capillary motion of a solution containing the perovskite precursor on a microchannel. The structure is characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and atomic force microscopy. The current-voltage characteristics and current transient responses are measured under different conditions of dark and light. Additionally, an apparent piezo-photocurrent modulation is observed under both normal and transverse forces on MAPbI(3) by testing the device under normal forces and bending conditions (inward and outward). In the highest state, the photocurrent is increased by 97% when 340 kPa normal force is applied to the device. At this state, the device shows a I-ph/I-dark of 3250 at 2.0 V bias with a photocurrent of approximate to 6.9 mu A and responsivity of 14.56 mA W-1. These results promise utilizing MAPbI(3) in piezotronic applications and hybrid energy harvesters.

A window of constant growth per cycle is found between 185 and 200 degrees C at 0.12 nm/cycle, among the highest reported for ALD NiO. For films deposited at 200 degrees C, grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction indicates a randomly oriented polycrystalline cubic NiO phase. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows good agreement with bulk NiO reference spectra and no detectable impurities. Atomic force microscopy reveals low root mean square roughness of 0.6 nm for an 18 nm thick film. The refractive index of 2.36 and an electronic bandgap of 3.78 eV, as determined by variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry, are close to reported values for bulk and thin film NiO. Finally, fabricated Ag/NiO/n-Si/In heterojunction diodes show a current-voltage asymmetry of 1.27 x 10(4) at 2.3 V and an ideality factor of 3.5, confirming the intrinsic p-type semiconducting behavior of transparent NiO.

Here, we studied size-dependent charge separation (CS) and charge recombination (CR) between CsPbI3 QDs and rhodamine B (RhB) molecules, using transient absorption spectroscopy. When the average size decreases from 11.8 nm to 6.5 nm, the average intrinsic CS time constant decreases from 872 +/- 52 ps to 40.6 +/- 4.3 ps and the corresponding charge recombination time constant decreases from 3829 +/- 51 ns to 1384 +/- 54 ns. The observed trend of size-dependent CS and CR rates can be well explained by Marcus theory using the theoretically calculated CS and CR driving forces (Delta G(CS) and Delta G(CR)), molecular reorganization energy (lambda(RhB)), and electronic coupling strength between QD and RhB (H-CS and H-CR). Unlike the extensively studied more strongly quantum confined Cd chalcogenide QDs, the CsPbI3 QDs are in a weak quantum confinement regime in which size-dependent coupling strength plays a dominant role in the size-dependent charge transfer properties.

Herein, we report a novel dopant-free HTM featuring a dithieno[3,2-b:2 ',3 '-d]pyrrole core flanked with two-fold triphenylamine arm substituted thiophene bridges. This star-shaped molecule shows a suitable ionization potential (5.13 eV), good thermal stability (high glass-transition temperature of 120.3 degrees C) and a high hole mobility (6.50 x 10(-5) cm(2) V-1 s(-1)). The molecule is more hydrophobic than reference spiro-OMeTAD in a film. By capping our dopant-free HTM on the perovskite layer, the fabricated n-i-p device can achieve a maximum power conversion efficiency of 19.42%, which is comparable to the device based on doped spiro-OMeTAD (19.59%). This star-shaped dithieno[3,2-b:2 ',3 '-d]pyrrole based molecule is thus a promising candidate HTM for upscaling the commercial manufacture of PVSCs.

Melanin absorbs sunlight and transforms it into heat, which is crucial for avoiding damage to skin cells. Light absorption produces excited electrons, which could either fall back to ground states by releasing the heat (photothermal effect) and/or light (photoluminescence), or stay at higher energy levels within its lifetime period, which can be captured through external electronic circuitry (photovoltaic effect). In this study, it is demonstrated that the combination of melanin with halide perovskite light absorber in the form of a composite exhibits high absorbance from the UV to NIR region in the solar spectrum. And the composite displays significantly reduced photoluminescence and minimized density of residual excited states (verified by photovoltaic measurement) owing to the significantly enhanced nonradiant quenching by the melanin. As a result, the composite shows an ultrahigh solar-thermal quantum yield of 99.56% and solar-thermal conversion efficiency of approximate to 81% under one-sun illumination (AM1.5), which is superior to typical carbon materials such as graphene (approximate to 70%). By coating the photothermal composite film on the hot-side of thermoelectric devices, a 7000% increase in output power as compared to the blank device under illumination is observed.

However, some challenges are still present for cheap mass fabrication in commercial applications. Herein, efficient Zn-SnOx electron transport layers (ETLs) are used by the low-temperature (100 degrees C) electron beam (E-beam) method. Doping Zn2+ in SnO2 improves conductivity, suppresses charge recombination, and optimizes the energy level structure of SnO2, leading to an improved PCE from 18.95% to 20.16%. More importantly, the PCE of the modified device is more than 80% of its initial values for 800 h in ambient air with a relative humidity of approximate to 40%. The flexible device exhibits a PCE of 15.25% and remains at an initial PCE of 83% after 100 bending cycles. The efficient and flexible PSCs are potentially used as wearable energy power sources. The low-temperature preparation of ETL and the excellent performance of devices present great commercial potential for future applications.

We report herein two dithieno[3,2-b:2 ',3 '-d]pyrrole (DTP) cored molecular semiconductors prepared through pi-conjugation extension and an N-alkylation strategy. The as-prepared conjugated molecules exhibit a highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of -4.82 eV and a hole mobility up to 2.16x10(-4) cm(2) V-1 s(-1). Together with excellent film-forming and over 99 % photoluminescence quenching efficiency on perovskite, the DTP based semiconductors work efficiently as hole-transporting materials (HTMs) for n-i-p structured PVSCs. Their dopant-free MA(0.7)FA(0.3)PbI(2.85)Br(0.15) devices exhibit a power conversion efficiency over 20 %, representing one of the highest values for un-doped molecular HTMs based PVSCs. This work demonstrates the great potential of using a DTP core in designing efficient semiconductors for dopant-free PVSCs.

Poor stability towards moisture, ultraviolet irradiation, heat, and a bias voltage of the perovskite layer and its various device interfaces limits the commercial feasibility of this material for outdoor applications. Herein, we investigate the role of hydrogen bonding interactions induced when metal halide perovskite crystals are crosslinked with alkyl or pi-conjugated boronic acid small molecules (-B(OH)(2)). The crosslinked perovskite crystals are investigated under continuous light irradiation and moisture exposure. These studies demonstrate that the origin of the interaction between the alkyl or pi-conjugated crosslinking molecules is due to hydrogen bonding between the -B(OH)(2) terminal group of the crosslinker and the I of the [PbI6](4-) octahedra of the perovskite layer. Also, this interaction influences the stability of the perovskite layer towards moisture and ultraviolet light irradiation. Morphology and structural analyses, as well as IR studies as a function of aging under both dark and light conditions show that pi-conjugated boronic acid molecules are more effective crosslinkers of the perovskite crystals than their alkyl counterparts thus imparting better stability towards light and moisture degradation.

Despite the electronic charge transport, phenomena regarding the spin-polarized electronic transport in OIHPs-based spintronic devices and the role of ferromagnet/OIHP spinterfaces remain unclear. In this work, the spin injection, accumulation, transport, and detection at room temperature for a vertical perovskite spin valve (PeSV) consisting of Ni/CH3NH3PbI3-xClx/Ni is reported. An in-plane anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) and a PeSV related magnetoresistance (MR) show remarkable magnetic switching behaviors due to the formation of Ni/CH3NH3PbI3-xClx spinterfaces, and the ferromagnetic coupling between two spin quantization axes of the spinterfaces. With assists of capacitance-frequency (C - - f) measurements under magnetic fields, the spin accumulation that occurs at the Ni/CH3NH3PbI3-xClx interface can be detected at the spin parallel (up arrow up arrow) and antiparallel (up arrow down arrow) configurations. Owing to a strong orbital interaction at the Ni/CH3NH3PbI3-xClx hybrid interface, the spin-sensitive electron paramagnetic spectroscopy (EPR) reveals significant change of the magnetic moment (mu). It is believed that the solution processed CH3NH3PbI3-xClx and the formation of the Ni/CH3NH3PbI3-xClx spinterface may hold an exceptionally important role for future hybrid optospintronic applications.

To achieve these impressive numbers, the PSC scientific community is working to improve the perovskite optoelectronic properties. Imaging and mapping characterization techniques have been widely used to understand the fundamental properties that allow lead halide perovskites to achieve high performance. In this review, these techniques are evaluated, from simple tools, such as electron microscopy, to more complex systems that include atomic force microscopy, synchrotron-based X-ray mapping, and ultrafast and photoluminescence mapping. These tools have helped understand lead halide perovskites and their impressive optoelectronic properties, which make them outstanding materials for solar cell applications.

Two-Dimensional Dion-Jacobson Hybrid Lead Iodide Perovskites with Aromatic Diammonium Cations	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							ORGANIC-INORGANIC PEROVSKITES; LIGHT-EMITTING-DIODES; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; 2D; EXCITONS; CESIUM; ENERGY; LAYERS	Two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites have extraordinary optoelectronic properties and structural tunability. Among them, the Dion-Jacobson phases with the inorganic layers stacking exactly on top of each other are less explored. Herein, we present the new series of 2D Dion-Jacobson halide perovskites, which adopt the general formula of A'A(n-1)Pb(n)I(3n+1) (A' = 4-(aminomethyl)pyridinium (4AMPY), A = methylammonium (MA), n = 1-4). By modifying the position of the CH2NH3+ group from 4AMPY to 3AMPY (3AMPY = 3-(aminomethyl)pyridinium), the stacking of the inorganic layers changes from exactly eclipsed to slightly offset. The perovskite octahedra tilts are also different between the two series, with the 3AMPY series exhibiting smaller bandgaps than the 4AMPY series. Compared to the aliphatic cation of the same size (AMP = (aminomethyl)piperidinium), the aromatic spacers increase the rigidity of the cation, reduce the interlayer spacing, and decrease the dielectric mismatch between inorganic layer and the organic spacer, showing the indirect but powerful influence of the organic cations on the structure and consequently on the optical properties of the perovskite materials. All A'A(n-1)Pb(n)I(3n+1) compounds exhibit strong photoluminescence (PL) at room temperature. Preliminary solar cell devices based on the n = 4 perovskites as absorbers of both series exhibit promising performances, with a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.20% for (3AMPY)(MA)(3)Pb4I13-based devices, which is higher than the (4AMPY)(MA)(3)Pb4I13 and the corresponding aliphatic analogue (3AMP)(MA)(3)Pb4I13-based ones.

In this work, cesium lead triiodide (CsPbI3) QDs are synthesized with a stable cubic phase and efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are fabricated using the ligand exchange technique. Monolayer graphene is grown by chemical vapor deposition technique and a dry process to transfer graphene on top of the device is developed. Based on this approach, an efficient inverted PSC is demonstrated with a high average visible transmittance (AVT). After optimization, PSCs based on silver and graphene electrodes with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 9.6% and 6.8% are achieved, respectively. Additionally, by tuning the thickness of the active layer, a PSC with PCE of 4.95% and AVT of 53% is demonstrated, indicating the potential of CsPbI3 QDs for the fabrication of semitransparent devices applicable in windows.

Controlling Solvate Intermediate Growth for Phase-Pure Organic Lead Iodide Ruddlesden-Popper (C4H9NH3)(2)(CH3NH3)(n-1)PbnI3n+1 Perovskite Thin Films	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							CHARGE-CARRIER DYNAMICS; HYBRID PEROVSKITE; SOLAR-CELLS; QUASI-2-DIMENSIONAL PEROVSKITE; CRYSTALLIZATION; PERFORMANCE; EFFICIENCY; LIGHT; STABILITY; COORDINATION	The growth of Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite thin films of organic lead halides is complicated by the existence of multiple crystallization pathways available to precursors in solution. During thin-film growth processes, such as spin-coating or blade-coating, solvents can evaporate too quickly to clearly resolve different reaction intermediates and products that form during crystallization. Here, we resolve multiple reaction products and intermediates that form during growth of (C4H9NH3)(2)(CH3NH3)(n-1)PbnI3n+1 Ruddlesden-Popper compounds by studying drop-cast precursor solutions through the evolution of X-ray diffraction, photoluminescence, and optical micrographs in situ over long timescales in a thin-film geometry. We found that methylammo- nium-rich solvate intermediates play a crucial role in directing the bulk optical properties of the films and form simultaneously with smaller regions of Ruddlesden-Popper phases during growth. The microstructure and optical properties of these sub- phases were characterized during growth and after annealing, revealing that discrepancies between thin-film and single-crystal optical properties originate from solvate intermediates. These lower-band-gap minority phases dominate the optical emission spectrum by means of rapid energy migration and contribute to sub-band-gap electronic states in photovoltaic devices. Processing routes to yield thin films with optical properties similar to single crystals of Ruddlesden-Popper phases were developed by tuning the precursor stoichiometry and deposition kinetics.

Wide-bandgap perovskite photovoltaic cells for indoor light energy harvesting are presented with the 1.63 and 1.84 eV devices that demonstrate efficiencies of 21% and 18.5%, respectively, under indoor compact fluorescent lighting, with a champion open-circuit voltage of 0.95 V in a 1.84 eV cell under a light intensity of 0.16 mW cm(-2). Subsequently, a wireless temperature sensor self-powered by a perovskite indoor light-harvesting module is demonstrated. Three perovskite photovoltaic cells are connected in series to create a module that produces 14.5 mu W output power under 0.16 mW cm(-2) of compact fluorescent illumination with an efficiency of 13.2%. This module is used as an external power source for a battery-assisted radio-frequency identification temperature sensor and demonstrates a read range by of 5.1 m while maintaining very high frequency measurements every 1.24 s. The combined indoor perovskite photovoltaic modules and backscatter radio-frequency sensors are further discussed as a route to ubiquitous sensing in buildings given their potential to be manufactured in an integrated manner at very low cost, their lack of a need for battery replacement, and the high frequency data collection possible.

Here nonconjugated multi-zwitterionic small-molecule electrolytes (NSEs) are introduced, which act not only as charge-extracting layers for barrier-free charge collection at planar triple cation PSC cathodes but also passivate charged defects at the perovskite bulk/interface via a spontaneous bottom-up passivation effect. Implementing these synergistic properties affords NSE-based planar PSCs that deliver a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 21.18% with a maximum V-OC = 1.19 V, in combination with suppressed hysteresis and enhanced environmental, thermal, and light-soaking stability. Thus, this work demonstrates that the bottom-up, simultaneous interfacial and bulk trap passivation using NSE modifiers is a promising strategy to overcome outstanding issues impeding further PSC advances.

With cyclic voltammetry and XPS results, the absence of pinholes on the SP-TiO2 compact films was indicated, and AFM and SEM results confirmed the SP-TiO2 compact films had lower surface roughness and more compact particle connectivity, offering a decent interface between the perovskite active layer and the adjacent TiO2 films. The performance of the SP-PSCs using the SP-TiO2 compact films was 7.06%, which was 3 times higher than that of the SC-PSCs. V-oc decay measurement also confirmed that such pinhole-free and improved film interfaces of SP-TiO2 compact films contributed to elongating electron lifetime in PSCs by the enhanced hole blocking effect of the SP-TiO2 compact films.

Herein, we introduce a facile synthetic route of thiazole-modified carbon nitride with 1.5 nm thick nanosheets which can be processed to a homogeneous, metal-free ETL for inverted perovskite solar cells. We show that thiazole-modified carbon nitride enables electronic interface enhancement via suppression of charge recombination, achieving 1.09 V in V-oc and a rise to 20.17 mA/cm(2) in J(sc). Hence, this report presents the successful implementation of a carbon-nitride-based structure to boost charge extraction from the perovskite absorber toward the electron transport layer in p-i-n devices.

However, the existence of oxygen vacancies fundamentally causes photoexcited carrier trapping and large leakage current. Therefore, it is still challenging to limit oxygen vacancies while maintaining low bandgap and high ferroelectricity. Here, an efficient charge compensation strategy by finely adjusting the ion ratio on the A-site to obtain an oxygen-vacancy-free relaxer ferroelectric is demonstrated in the system of NaxBiyTiO3-BaTi0.5Ni0.5O3, where y > x. It is found that the oxygen-vacancy-free composition still yields strong visible-near-infrared-light-absorbing and enhanced photoresponse, in which the photocurrent density doubles from approximate to 0.16 to approximate to 0.32 mu A cm(-2). A new bandgap tuning mechanism is proposed according to the local structural information of Ni ions obtained via extended X-ray absorption fine structure. Moreover, this work succeeds in establishing the relationship between the concentration of oxygen vacancies and ferroelectric/piezoelectric properties of NaxBiyTiO3-BaTi0.5Ni0.5O3. This research points out a promising route to the material design of bandgap engineered ferroelectrics with controlled defects, which is expected to benefit a wide range of functional energy conversion devices.

Interface Molecular Engineering for Laminated Monolithic Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells with 80.4% Fill Factor	ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS			English	Article						density functional theory; lamination; molecular dynamics; monolithic tandem; perovskite; silicon; transparent-conductive-adhesive	OPTICAL-ABSORPTION; PEDOT; CONDUCTIVITY; POLYMER; PSS; ELECTRODES; EFFICIENCY; TRANSPORT; POLARONS; MODULES	A multipurpose interconnection layer based on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), and d-sorbitol for monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells is introduced. The interconnection of independently processed silicon and perovskite subcells is a simple add-on lamination step, alleviating common fabrication complexities of tandem devices. It is demonstrated experimentally and theoretically that PEDOT:PSS is an ideal building block for manipulating the mechanical and electrical functionality of the charge recombination layer by controlling the microstructure on the nano- and mesoscale. It is elucidated that the optimal functionality of the recombination layer relies on a gradient in the d-sorbitol dopant distribution that modulates the orientation of PEDOT across the PEDOT:PSS film. Using this modified PEDOT:PSS composite, a monolithic two-terminal perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell with a steady-state efficiency of 21.0%, a fill factor of 80.4%, and negligible open circuit voltage losses compared to single-junction devices is shown. The versatility of this approach is further validated by presenting a laminated two-terminal monolithic perovskite/organic tandem solar cell with 11.7% power conversion efficiency. It is envisioned that this lamination concept can be applied for the pairing of multiple photovoltaic and other thin film technologies, creating a universal platform that facilitates mass production of tandem devices with high efficiency.

These capping lead oxysalt thin layers enhance the water resistance of the perovskite films by forming strong chemical bonds. The wide-bandgap lead oxysalt layers also reduce the defect density on the perovskite surfaces by passivating undercoordinated surface lead centers, which are defect-nucleating sites. Formation of the lead oxysalt layer increases the carrier recombination lifetime and boosts the efficiency of the solar cells to 21.1%. Encapsulated devices stabilized by the lead oxysalt layers maintain 96.8% of their initial efficiency after operation at maximum power point under simulated air mass (AM) 1.5 G irradiation for 1200 hours at 65 degrees C.

Here a facile and efficient solution-phase method is demonstrated to synthesize lead-free Cs2SnX6 (X = Br, I) with a well-defined crystal structure, long-term stability, and high yield. Based on the systematic experimental data and first-principle simulation results, Cs2SnX6 displays excellent stability against moisture, light, and high temperature, which can be ascribed to the unique vacancy-ordered defect-variant structure, stable chemical compositions with Sn4+, as well as the lower formation enthalpy for Cs2SnX6. Additionally, photodetectors based on Cs2SnI6 are also fabricated, which show excellent performance and stability. This study provides very useful insights into the development of lead-free double perovskites with high stability.

Herein, PbI2 was thermally deposited at high-vacuum conditions onto CVD-grown monolayer MoS2 flakes in a vdW epitaxial manner to form 3D-2D heterojunctions, which are promising for vdW epitaxial growth of perovskite films. X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, Raman, and atomic force microscopy measurements reveal the structural properties of the high-quality heterojunctions. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements reveal that the PL emissions from the bottom MoS2 flakes are greatly quenched compared to their as-grown counterparts, which can be ascribed to the band alignment-induced distinct interfacial charge-transfer behaviors. Strong interlayer excitons can be detected at the PbI2/MoS2 interface, indicating an effective type II band alignment, which can be further confirmed by ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy measurements. The results provide a new material platform for the application of the vdW heterojunctions in electronic and optoelectronic devices.

Detection of Rashba spin splitting in 2D organic-inorganic perovskite via precessional carrier spin relaxation	APL MATERIALS			English	Article							PHASE-TRANSITIONS; SOLAR-CELLS; EXCITON; DYNAMICS; CRYSTALS; MOBILITY; LENGTHS; TIN	The strong spin-orbit interaction in the organic-inorganic perovskites tied to the incorporation of heavy elements (e.g., Pb and I) makes these materials interesting for applications in spintronics. In conjunction with a lack of inversion symmetry associated with distortions of the metal-halide octahedra, surfaces and interfaces, or the application of a bias, the Rashba effect (used in spin field-effect transistors and spin filters) has been predicted to be much larger in these materials than in traditional III-V semiconductors such as GaAs. Evidence of strong Rashba coupling has been observed in both 3D (bulk) and 2D perovskites, with the relative role of bulk and surface Rashba contributions in the former case under active debate. The varying size of the reported spin splittings points to the need for more experimental studies of Rashba effects in the organic-inorganic perovskite family of materials. Here, we apply time-resolved circular dichroism techniques to the study of carrier spin dynamics in a 2D perovskite thin film [(BA)(2)MAPb(2)I(7); BA = CH3(CH2)(3)NH3, MA = CH3NH3]. Our findings confirm the presence of a Rashba spin splitting via the dominance of precessional spin relaxation induced by the Rashba effective magnetic field (also known as D'yakonov Perel spin relaxation). The size of the Rashba spin splitting in our system was extracted from simulations of the measured spin dynamics incorporating LO-phonon and electron-electron scattering, yielding a value of 10 meV at an electron energy of 50 meV above the band gap, representing a 20 times larger value than in GaAs quantum wells.

Here, the underlying reasons for ease of processing are revealed. It is found that halide and cation engineering leads to a systematic widening of the anti-solvent processing window for the fabrication of high-quality films and efficient solar cells. This window widens from seconds, in the case of single cation/halide systems (e.g., MAPbI(3), FAPbI(3), and FAPbBr(3)), to several minutes for mixed systems. In situ X-ray diffraction studies reveal that the processing window is closely related to the crystallization of the disordered sol-gel and to the number of crystalline byproducts; the processing window therefore depends directly on the precise cation/halide composition. Moreover, anti-solvent dripping is shown to promote the desired perovskite phase with careful formulation. The processing window of perovskite solar cells, as defined by the latest time the anti-solvent drip yields efficient solar cells, broadened with the increasing complexity of cation/halide content. This behavior is ascribed to kinetic stabilization of sol-gel state through cation/halide engineering. This provides guidelines for designing new formulations, aimed at formation of the perovskite phase, ultimately resulting in high-efficiency perovskite solar cells produced with ease and with high reproducibility.

In particular, PSCs have demonstrated rapid degradation under illumination, the driving mechanism of which is yet to be understood. It is shown that elevated device temperature coupled with excess charge carriers due to constant illumination is the dominant force in the rapid degradation of encapsulated perovskite solar cells under illumination. Cooling the device to 20 degrees C and operating at the maximum power point improves the stability of CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells over 100x compared to operation under open circuit conditions at 60 degrees C. Light-induced strain originating from photothermal-induced expansion is also observed in CH3NH3PbI3, which excludes other light-induced-strain mechanisms. However, strain and electric field do not appear to play any role in the initial rapid degradation of CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells under illumination. It is revealed that the formation of additional recombination centers in PSCs facilitated by elevated temperature and excess charge carriers ultimately results in rapid light-induced degradation. Guidance on the best methods for measuring the stability of PSCs is also given.

J	Khanal, R; Ayers, N; Banerjee, S; Choudhury, S				Khanal, Rabi; Ayers, Nicholas; Banerjee, Soumik; Choudhury, Samrat			Atomic structure and electronic properties of lead and tin based hybrid halide perovskite surface for photovoltaic applications	AIP ADVANCES			English	Article							TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; SOLAR-CELLS; 1ST-PRINCIPLES; CH3NH3PBI3; EFFICIENCY; TERMINATION; MOBILITIES; INSIGHT	Organic-inorganic hybrid halide perovskites are emerging as one of the potential materials in the photovoltaic community due to its attractive power conversion efficiency and cost-effective device fabrication. The photovoltaic performance of hybrid halide perovskite is linked to its atomic and electronic structure at the surface. Here we have used electronic structure calculations to determine the structural and electronic properties at the surface of MABX(3) (MA = CH3NH3; B = Sn or Pb; X= I, Br, or Cl) perovskites. Next, we compared calculated electronic properties of the surface with the corresponding bulk values. Our results reveal that the structural properties like B-X distances, B-X-B angles, and orientation of MA are different between bulk to perovskite surface. Such changes in structural features at the perovskite surface lead to change in the band gap between surface and bulk perovskite. Both structural features and the band gap at the surface are found to be dependent on the crystal symmetry and chemistry of the perovskite. Further, for all perovskite compositions investigated, no midgap surface electronic states were observed. (C) 2019 Author(s).

CH3NH3PbBr3 films deposited without Ag+ exhibit only a weakly preferred (011) orientation. Compositional maps and depth profiles from time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) reveal Ag+ segregated to grain boundaries and interfaces. In photovoltaic devices (PVs), addition of Ag+ to MAPBr films resulted in poorer device performance, most likely because of the observed Ag+ segregation in the films.

More importantly, a series of reactions within an ITO/hybrid perovskite/Au device can be electrochemically induced near room temperature by applied cathodic voltages as low as -1.2 V. Cyclic voltammetry in this range leads to eventual In3+ leaching into the perovskite layer in the form of InI3, unambiguously identified by a binding energy signature of 445.9-446.3 eV measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Furthermore, the etching is exacerbated by defects generated by O-2-plasma treatment of the ITO compared to UV-ozone cleaning, lowering the reaction potential and the electrochemical stability window of an ITO/MAPbI(3)/Au device. Low-temperature, electrochemical reactivity at this interface has implications on operational stability, fundamental studies of hybrid perovskite materials, electron (or hole) transport layer free perovskite devices, reverse bias degradation, and other applications where ITO/hybrid perovskite contact is possible.

One effective strategy for the production of materials satisfying these requirements is to adjust their band structure and corresponding bandgap energy by introducing oxygen vacancies. A simple chemical reduction method that can systematically generate oxygen vacancies in barium stannate (BaSnO3 (BSO)) crystal is introduced, which thus allows for precise control of the bandgap energy. A BSO photoanode with optimum oxygen-vacancy concentration (8.7%) exhibits high light-absorption and good charge-separation capabilities. After deposition of FeOOH/NiOOH oxygen evolution cocatalysts on its surface, this photoanode shows a remarkable photocurrent density of 7.32 mA cm(-2) at a potential of 1.23 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode under AM1.5G simulated sunlight. Moreover, a tandem device constructed with a perovskite solar cell exhibits an operating photocurrent density of 6.84 mA cm(-2) and stable gas production with an average solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 7.92% for 100 h, thus functioning as an outstanding unbiased water-splitting system.

Moreover, the synthesized NiO contains surface defects acting as trapping sites at the NiO/perovskite interfaces, resulting in poor charge extraction, hysteresis and light soaking. In this manuscript, we developed a non-toxic methodology for NiO precursor solution by using a simple mixture of NiO powder and HCl in an air environment. In addition, a new hot-casting technique was developed to successfully fabricate densely-packed, less defective NiO films. Interestingly, the hot-casting temperature was found to significantly affect morphology, film coverage and surface defects of NiO films. When a hot-casting temperature was below 100 degrees C, non-uniform NiO films were sparsely formed on the FTO surface and were characterized by defects in the form of hydroxyl groups and water on the surface. Such defective NiO films resulted in severe hysteresis and light soaking effect due to the trapped charges at the defective NiO/perovskite interface of perovskite solar cells. In contrast, when the hot-casting temperature was 120 degrees C, the NiO film formed densely-packed morphologies, covering the FTO surface. Furthermore, this film exhibited an ordered chemistry with strong Ni-O octahedral bonding and facilitated charge extraction at NiO/perovskite interface, resulting in a negligible hysteresis and light soaking. Finally, this non-toxic and simple method of fabricating NiO film will assist further development of perovskite solar cells.

However, the cell efficiency in all-inorganic perovskite solar cells is still far below that in organic inorganic hybrid perovskite-based devices. Here, we develop a new strategy to mediate the CsPbI2Br crystallization by directly doping copper(II) bromide (CuBr2) into a perovskite precursor. The incorporation of CuBr2 played a role in retarding the crystallization dynamics process of CsPbI2Br film, resulting in a high-quality all-inorganic perovskite film with enlarged grain size, improved carrier mobilities, and reduced trap states. The fabricated perovskite solar cells delivered a champion power conversion efficiency of 16.15%, which is the highest efficiency in CsPbI2Br based all-inorganic perovskite solar cells and largely higher than 13.24% for pristine CsPbI2Br based device. The developed doping method paves a new route to fabricate high-performance all-inorganic perovskite solar cells.

However, Auger recombination, one of the key processes that limit their performance, remains poorly understood in CsPbX3 2D NPLs and 1D NRs. We show that the biexciton Auger lifetimes of CsPbBr3 NPLs (NRs) scale linearly with the NPL lateral area (NR length) and deviates from the "universal volume scale law" that has been observed for QDs. These results are consistent with a model in which the Auger recombination rate for 1D NRs and 2D NPLs is a product of binary collision frequency in the nonquantum confined dimension and Auger probability per collision. Comparisons of Auger recombination in CsPbBr3 NCs of different dimensionalities and similar band gaps suggest that Auger probability increases in NCs with a higher number of confined dimensions. Compared to CdSe and PbSe NCs with the same dimensionalities and similar sizes, Auger recombination rates in OD-2D CsPbBr3 NCs are over 10-fold faster. Fast Auger recombination in CsPbBr3 NCs shows their potentials for Auger-assisted up-conversion and single photon source, while suppressing Auger recombination may further enhance their performances in LED and lasing applications.

Efficient perovskite solar cells usually incorporate the ionic dopants within the charge transfer material to secure their electrical conductivity. Typical ionic dopants are hygroscopic, resulting in significant moisture adsorption and accelerated perovskite degradation. Herein, we report a nonionic dopant, Sc3N@C-80, consisting of a hydrophobic fullerene cage that encapsulates the metal salt to achieve a moisture resistive and highly electrically conductive hole transfer layer (HTL). The direct electronic transaction between Sc3N@C-80 and spiro-OMeTAD renders a drastically improved conductivity and a lower Fermi-level of the HTL to minimize the Schottky barrier. The hydrophobicity of Sc3N@C-80 also decreases the moisture wettability. Perovskite solar cells using the Sc3N@C-80-doped HTL exhibit an efficiency surge from 18.15 to 20.77% (champion cell exhibiting 21.09%) and improved device stability (survival efficiency over 17% after continuous illumination for 800 h). The bifunctional hydrophobic Sc3N@C-80 dopant provides a pathway toward efficient and stable perovskite photovoltaics.

Rapid Charge-Transfer Cascade through SWCNT Composites Enabling Low-Voltage Losses for Perovskite Solar Cells	ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							PHOTOLUMINESCENCE; RECOMBINATION; EXTRACTION; EFFICIENT; DYNAMICS; NANOTUBE; LIMIT	Good charge selective contacts are vital to achieving efficient perovskite solar cells. The selectivity of such a contact is determined by its energetic offset or alignment with the bands of the perovskite absorber and, most importantly, by its interfacial recombination losses. In this study, we use single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) as a high-mobility hole extraction layer at the interface with a perovskite absorber. When employed as a charge-transfer cascade-like structure with a low-mobility hole-selective contact, this configuration can suppress the interfacial recombination through the rapid removal of holes from the interface region. Reducing these recombination losses in turn results in very low voltage losses of less than 340 mV in n-i-p perovskite solar cells.

Enhanced Open-Circuit Voltage of Wide-Bandgap Perovskite Photovoltaics by Using Alloyed (FA(1-x)Cs(x))Pb(I1-xBrx)(3) Quantum Dots	ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							LEAD HALIDE PEROVSKITES; DETAILED BALANCE LIMIT; ANION-EXCHANGE; ALPHA-CSPBI3 PEROVSKITE; PHASE SEGREGATION; SOLAR-CELLS; NANOCRYSTALS; EFFICIENCY; STABILITY; CSPBX3	We report a detailed study on APbX(3) (A = formamidinium (FA(+)), Cs+; X = I-, Br-) perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) with combined A- and X-site alloying that exhibits both a wide bandgap and high open-circuit voltage (V-oc) for the application of a potential top cell in tandem junction photovoltaic (PV) devices. The nanocrystal alloying affords control over the optical bandgap and is readily achieved by solution-phase cation and anion exchange between previously synthesized FAPbI(3) and CsPbBr3 PQDs. Increasing only the Br- content of the PQDs widens the bandgap but results in shorter carrier lifetimes and associated V-oc losses in devices. These deleterious effects can be mitigated by replacing Cs+ with FA(+), resulting in wide-bandgap PQD absorbers with improved charge-carrier mobility and PVs with higher V-oc. Although further device optimization is required, these results demonstrate the potential of FA(1-x)Cs(x)Pb(I1-xBrx)(3) PQDs for wide-bandgap perovskite PVs with high V-oc.

The change in halide composition in these two similar to 130 nm thick films occurs concurrently with Br- diffusing toward the MAPbI(3) film and I- diffusing toward the MAPbBr(3) film. The diffusion of these halide species, which is tracked through changes in the absorption, offers a direct measurement of thermally activated halide diffusion in perovskite films. The increase in the rate constant of halide diffusion with increasing temperature (from 8.3 x 10(-6) s(-1) at 23 degrees C to 3.7 x 10(-4) s(-1) at 140 degrees C) follows an Arrhenius relationship with activation energy of 51 kJ/mol. The thermally activated halide exchange shows the challenges of employing layers of different metal halide perovskites in stable tandem solar cells.

However, the effectiveness of this approach is limited by the intrinsically low solid-solubility of Cs in bulk FAPbI(3). To circumvent this issue, we demonstrate a method that entails solution-deposition of high-Cs-content Cs(1-x)FA(x)PbI(3) alloy quantum dots (QDs) onto a bulk Cs-lean FAPbI(3)-based thin film. This results in a thin film with a Cs-rich QD surface layer, which stabilizes the thin film against the ambient environment. Stable, efficient perovskite solar cells based on these new thin-film structures are demonstrated.

In this work, the side chain of a polymeric HTM is engineered by partially introducing diethylene glycol (DEG) groups in order to simultaneously optimize the properties of both the bulk of the HTM layer and the HTM/perovskite interface. The intermolecular pi-pi stacking interaction in the HTM layer is unexpectedly weakened after the incorporation of DEG groups, whereas the lamellar packing interaction is strengthened. A doubled hole mobility is obtained when 3% of the DEG groups replace the original alkyl side chains, and a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.19% (certified: 20.10%) is then achieved, which is the first report of values over 20% for dopant-free organic HTMs. The device maintains 92.25% of its initial PCE after storing at ambient atmosphere for 30 d, which should be due to the enhanced hydrophobicity of the HTM film.

Detailed-balance analysis of Yb3+:CsPb(Cl1-xBrx)(3) quantum-cutting layers for high-efficiency photovoltaics under real-world conditions	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							TANDEM SOLAR-CELLS; PEROVSKITE NANOCRYSTALS; DOWN-CONVERSION; CRYSTALLINE SILICON; LIMIT; ENHANCE; YIELDS; FILMS	Yb3+-Doped lead-halide perovskites (Yb3+:CsPb(Cl1-xBrx)(3)) have emerged as unique materials combining strong, tunable broadband absorption with near-infrared photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) approaching 200% at ambient temperature. These remarkable properties make Yb3+:CsPb(Cl1-xBrx)(3) an extremely promising candidate for spectral shaping in high-efficiency photovoltaic devices. Previous theoretical assessments of such "downconversion" devices have predicted single-junction efficiencies up to 40%, but have been highly idealized. Real materials like Yb3+:CsPb(Cl1-xBrx)(3) have practical limitations such as constrained band-gap and PL energies, non-directional emission, and an excitation-power-dependent PLQY. Hence, it is unclear whether Yb3+:CsPb(Cl1-xBrx)(3), or any other non-ideal quantum-cutting material, can indeed boost the efficiencies of real high-performance PV. Here, we examine the thermodynamic, detailed-balance efficiency limit of Yb3+:CsPb(Cl1-xBrx)(3) on different existing PV under real-world conditions. Among these, we identify silicon heterojunction technology as very promising for achieving significant performance gains when paired with Yb3+:CsPb(Cl1-xBrx)(3), and we predict power-conversion efficiencies of up to 32% for this combination. Surprisingly, PL saturation does not negate the improved device performance. Calculations accounting for actual hourly incident solar photon fluxes show that Yb3+:CsPb(Cl1-xBrx)(3) boosts power-conversion efficiencies at all times of day and year in two representative geographic locations. Predicted annual energy yields are comparable to those of tandem perovskite-on-silicon technologies, but without the need for current matching, tracking, or additional electrodes and inverters. In addition, we show that band-gap optimization in real quantum cutters is inherently a function of their PLQY and the ability to capture that PL. These results provide key design rules needed for development of high-efficiency quantum-cutting photovoltaic devices based on Yb3+:CsPb(Cl1-xBrx)(3).

Electromodulation and Transient Absorption Spectroscopy Suggest Conduction Band Electron Lifetime, Electron Trapping Parameters, and CH(3)NH(3)Pbl(3) Solar Cell Fill Factor Are Correlated	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							PEROVSKITE FILMS; CHARGE-TRANSFER; CH3NH3PBI3 PEROVSKITE; INFRARED-ABSORPTION; CARRIER DYNAMICS; EFFECTIVE-MASS; LEAD; RECOMBINATION; EXCITON; STATES	While lead halide perovskite solar cells have shown a steady increase in power conversion efficiencies over the past several years, it is well-known that minor variations in film fabrication conditions have a major impact on solar performance. In comparing devices assembled with either a 1-step or 2-step CH3NH3PbI3 film fabrication, we observe an increased fill factor and decreased subgap photocurrent in devices made with the 1-step method. These subgap states correlate with bleaching in NIR transient absorption measurements. We also observe induced absorptions in this region which we attribute to overlapping signals from photoexcited conduction band (E-1/2u -> F-1/2u) and valence band (F-3/2g -> E-1/2g) carrier transitions. This assignment is consistent with electromodulation spectroscopy under cathodic and anodic charge accumulation conditions, where we observed an absorption onset at a higher energy under electron accumulation (850 nm) compared to that of hole accumulation (1050 nm). Global target analysis of our time-resolved spectra suggests that the temporal evolution of photogenerated conduction band electrons and trap state bleaching dynamics are correlated. We modeled the kinetics of the species-associated spectra based on free charge extraction, bimolecular recombination, charge trapping, and Auger recombination processes and found that longer electron lifetimes correlate with decreased trap state density and improved device efficiency resulting from higher fill factors. The AC nature of our spectroelectrochemical detection also allows us to virtually eliminate the film degradation that has plagued DC electrochemical studies of halide perovskite materials. Our results provide fundamental insight into the impact of charge carrier dynamics on photovoltaic device performance.

Band Gaps and Stability of CsSiX3 Halides	PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI A-APPLICATIONS AND MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article						band structure; halides; metastability; Si-based	SOLAR-CELLS; PEROVSKITE	There is a great current interest in lead-free halide perovskites. While Sn based and Ge based compounds of this type have already been demonstrated experimentally, Si based ones have not. In this paper, the authors consider the possibility of CsSiX3 halide perovskites. While previous work for cubic CsSiI3 found the band gap to close or in fact become inverted and to lead to a topological insulator, the authors show here that in the rhombohedrally distorted structure that occurs because of Si off-centering, the band gap becomes larger than 1.5 eV and possibly of interest for photovoltaics. On the other hand, even in the cubic structure at high temperature, fluctuations of the Si position, will lead to a sizable gap. The total energy calculations, show that the materials are unstable toward 3CsSiI(3) -> Si2I6 + 3CsI + Si and 2CsSiI(3) -> SiI4 + 2CsI + Si and are thus above the convex hull. Similar results are presented for halogens: I, Br, Cl.	[Radha, Santosh K.; Lambrecht, Walter R.

The large exciton binding energy and natural quantum well structure not only make these materials ideal platforms to study light-matter interactions but also render them suitable for fabrication of various functional optoelectronic devices. Nanoscale structuring and morphology control have led to semiconductors with enhanced functionalities. Nanowires of semiconducting materials are extensively used for important applications like lasing and sensing. However, catalyst and template-free scalable growth of nanowires of 2D perovskites has remained elusive. In this paper, a facile approach for morphology-controlled growth of nanowires of 2D perovskite, (BA)(2)PbI4, is demonstrated. Additionally, it is shown that the photoluminescence (PL) from the nanowires is highly polarized with a polarization ratio as large as approximate to 0.73, which is one of the largest reported for perovskites. It is further shown that the photocurrent from the hybrid nanowire/graphene device is also sensitive to the polarization of the incident light with the photocurrent anisotropy ratio of approximate to 3.62 (much larger than the previously reported value of 2.68 for perovskites), thus demonstrating the potential of these nanowires as highly efficient photodetectors for polarized light.

To accelerate the degradation process, the PSCs are exposed to concentrated sunlight of 2 suns with different illumination duration under the short-circuited condition. Compared to under the open-circuited condition, the PSCs presented here show a slightly more obvious decrease of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and a more distinct hysteresis with the time of light exposure. We infer that, under the short-circuited condition, the more dramatic migration of ions induced by photocurrents should result in greater ohmic dissipation and more trap states. But the weak degradation effects indicate that the devices still exhibit an unexpected photochemical stability against light exposure. Most importantly, there is a self-healing behavior to partly recover the degradation with the light exposure time of more than 8 h, which can be ascribed to the modification from the Cu electrode and the charge transport layers of PTAA and Bphen. Being wrapped tightly in these coverlayers, the possible volatile decomposition products are restrained inside of the MAPbI(3) layers and converted back to MAPbI(3) with a great probability.

Carrier concentration can be controlled, ranging from 10(19) to 10(14) cm(-3). Films deposition is performed at 200 degrees C, a relatively low temperature that enables the use of glass as substrate. Experimental band diagrams for n-type NiO are obtained for the first time. Finally, a NiO homojunction is demonstrated by introducing a low carrier concentration layer in between n- and p(+)-type NiO layers. Layers are deposited in situ, preventing contamination and improving the interface quality, as observed by TEM. The Ni:O ratio for each layer was also obtained by analytical TEM measurements, demonstrating the impact of the oxygen partial pressure on the films' stoichiometry and the simplicity of our process to control carrier type and carrier concentration in oxide semiconductors.

However, its band gap of about 1.55 eV is out of the best range from 1.1 to 1.4 eV for an optimal single-junction solar cell, which is adverse to further improve the power conversion efficiency. To obtain the perovskite with the suitable band gaps and tunable electronic structures, cubic (Li3O)M(BH4)(3-x)Br-x (M = Ge, Sn and Pb; x = 0-3) perovskites are systematically studied by employing density functional theory based first principles calculations. The calculated results show that the (Li3O)M(BH4)(3-x)Br-x perovskites have suitable tolerance factors and negative formation energies, tunable direct band gap from 0.97 to 2.42 eV, and small electron effective masses as well as the different charge densities for conduction band minimum and valence band maximum states. The calculated results also suggest that cubic (Li3O)Ge(BH4)Br-2 and (Li3O)Pb(BH4)(2)Br perovskites can show the power conversion efficiency of 23.12% for the loss-inpotential of 0.5 eV. Interestingly, the power conversion efficiencies of the (Li3O)M(BH4)(3-x)Br-x perovskites are first increased then decreased with the increase of Br atom.

The key to realizing those functionalities is essentially the fabrication of conductive electrodes with desirable mechanical properties. Conductive polymers (CPs) of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) have emerged to be the most promising flexible electrode materials over rigid metallic oxides and play a critical role in these unprecedented devices as transparent electrodes, hole transport layers, interconnectors, electroactive layers, or motion-sensing conductors. Here, the current status of research on PEDOT:PSS is summarized including various approaches to boosting the electrical conductivity and mechanical compliance and stability, directly linked to the underlying mechanism of the performance enhancements. Along with the basic principles, the most cutting edge-progresses in devices with PEDOT:PSS are highlighted. Meanwhile, the advantages and plausible problems of the CPs and as-fabricated devices are pointed out. Finally, new perspectives are given for CP modifications and device fabrications. This work stresses the importance of developing CP films and reveals their critical role in the evolution of these next-generation devices featuring wearable, deformable, printable, ultrathin, and see-through characteristics.

Morphology of X-ray detector Cs2TeI6 perovskite thick films grown by electrospray method	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; DEPOSITION	For the purpose of developing Cs2TeI6 based X-ray detectors and imaging devices, Cs2TeI6 thick films were prepared using the electrospray method under ambient conditions. The effects of spraying parameters on the morphology of the films were investigated. During the electrospray process, we observed that Cs2TeI6 microdroplets changed to a steady cone jet and then to an unstable multi-jet model as the electrical bias increased from 6 kV to 12 kV, resulting in variable film morphologies. Five representative solvent systems with different evaporation rates and contact angles on the FTO/double-TiO2 substrates were studied. We find a strong correlation of the contact angle with the speed of primary nucleation, growth mode and subsequent film morphology. Moreover, the crystalline quality has been improved with the rise of substrate temperature. Finally, a dense and uniform Cs2TeI6 film was obtained with an electrical bias of 10 kV using dimethyl formamide (DMF) as the solvent at a substrate temperature of 160 degrees C. The resulting Cs2TeI6 films have resistivity on the order of 10(10) Omega cm, which indicates potential applications in X-ray detection and imaging. The films show a strong photoresponse to visible light based on the Cs2TeI6 thick film devices, and an on-off ratio of 22 under 425 nm light (similar to 65 mW cm(-2)). The sensitivity of the assembled Cs2TeI6 perovskite-based detectors can be 2.4 nC R-1 cm(-2) under illumination of 60 kVp X-rays.

However, due to the toxic element (Pb2+), environmentally friendly white-light emissions are difficult to achieve, thus limiting their practical applications. Herein, high-quality Mg2+-alloyed CsPb1-xMgxX3 (up to 20%) nanocrystals (NCs) are synthesized. The structural and optical properties are investigated. The application of these NCs in white-light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is also demonstrated. The incorporation of Mg2+ into CsPb1-xMgxX3 NCs results in a lattice contraction without a change in structure and morphology, blue-shifts in the photoluminescence emission, and increased bandgap. Then, the tunable emission (approximate to 408-650 nm) is obtained by adjusting the compositions of different halides (for 20% Mg2+). Most importantly, for the first time, 3D printed thin color conversion layers for different color emitting NCs (green, yellow, and red) are stacked on top of the blue-LEDs to achieve high-quality white light emission. A bright neutral white-light with a correlated-color temperature of 5806 K, a high color-rendering index of 89, CIE coordinates of (0.32, 0.33), a small D-uv (<0.003), and high luminous efficacy of radiation of 280 lm W-1 is achieved.

However, the low charge separation efficiency due to quantum confinement still remains a critical obstacle toward higher-performance perovskite CQD photovoltaics. Available strategies employed in the conventional CQD devices to enhance the carrier separation, such as the design of type-II core-shell structure and versatile surface modification to tune the electronic properties, are still not applicable to the perovskite CQD system owing to the difficulty in modulating surface ligands and structural integrity. Herein, a facile strategy that takes advantage of conjugated small molecules that provide an additional driving force for effective charge separation in perovskite CQD solar cells is developed. The resulting perovskite CQD solar cell shows a power conversion efficiency approaching 13% with an open-circuit voltage of 1.10 V, short-circuit current density of 15.4 mA cm(-2), and fill factor of 74.8%, demonstrating the strong potential of this strategy toward achieving high-performance perovskite CQD solar cells.

Here, a high-performance tandem ST-PV with selected absorption in the desirable regions of the solar spectrum is demonstrated. An ultralarge-bandgap perovskite film (FAPbBr(2.43)Cl(0.57), E-g approximate to 2.36 eV) is first developed to fulfil efficient selective absorption in the UV region. After optimization, the corresponding ST single junction (SJ) PV exhibits an averaged transmittance (AVT) of approximate to 68% and an efficiency of approximate to 7.5%. By sequentially reducing the visible absorbing component in a low-bandgap organic bulk-heterojunction layer, an ST-PV with selective absorption in the NIR is achieved with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.9% and a high AVT of 62%. The energy loss associated with the SJ ST-PVs is further reduced with a tandem architecture, which affords a high PCE of 10.7%, an AVT of 52.91%, and a light utilization efficiency up to 5.66%. These results represent the best balance of AVT and PCE among all ST-PVs reported so far, and this design should pave the road for solar windows of high performance.

Ongoing efforts to improve the stability of halide perovskites in ambient air has yielded promising results. However, the presence of toxic heavy element lead (Pb) remains a major concern requiring further attention. Herein, we report three new Pb-free hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite-type halides based on gold (Au), (CH3NH3)AuBr4 center dot H2O (1), (CH3NH3)AuCl2 center dot H2O (2), and (CH3NH3)AuCl4 (3). Hydrated compounds 1 and 2 crystallize in a brand-new structure type featuring perovskite-derived 2D layers and 1D chains based on pseudo-octahedral AuX6 building blocks. In contrast, the novel crystal structure of the solvent-free compound 3 shows an exotic non-perovskite quasi-2D layered structure containing edge- and corner-shared AuCl6 octahedra. The use of Au metal instead of Pb results in unprecedented low band gaps below 2.5 eV for single-layered metal chlorides and bromides. Moreover, at room temperature the three compounds show a weak blue emission due to the electronic transition between Au-6s and Au-5d, in agreement with the density function theory (DFT) calculation results. These findings are discussed in the context of viability of Au-based halides as alternatives for Pb-based halides for optoelectronic applications.

Improving the Stability and Monodispersity of Layered Cesium Lead Iodide Perovskite Thin Films by Tuning Crystallization Dynamics	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; CH3NH3PBI3 PEROVSKITE; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; BASE ADDUCT; EFFICIENCY; PHASE; LENGTHS; GROWTH; STABILIZATION; COORDINATION	Assembling halide perovskites into layered structures holds promise for addressing chemical and phase stability challenges; however, several other challenges need to be addressed to create efficient and stable halide perovskite devices. Layered halide perovskites (LHPs) suffer from a broad distribution of layer thicknesses and band gaps within thin films. Reducing polydispersity could substantially improve charge transport within LHP films and the performance of LHP-based solar cells. Herein, we focused on layering alpha-CsPbI3 ((C4H9NH3)(2)Csn-1,PbnI3n+1) thin films. We found that (C4H9NH3)(2)Cs(n-1)Pb(n)I3(n+1) with nominal layer thicknesses of n = 1, 2, 3, and 4 can be deposited at temperatures as low as 100 degrees C, substantially below the phase-transition temperature of bulk alpha-CsPbI3. Furthermore, we demonstrated that incorporating solvents with high complexation strength into the precursor solution promotes the formation of intermediate phases within the thin film, slowing down LHP crystallite nucleation, eventually resulting in improved phase purity. By reducing decomposition rates through combined use of solvent complexes and thermal processing methods, we fabricated (C4H9NH3)(2)CsPb2I7 films that had improved phase purity, crystallinity, and film morphology. We also demonstrate that the improved phase purity resulted in photoluminescence with a maximum intensity corresponding to the targeted n = 2 phase. This work represents a step toward highly stable LHP thin films with narrow site-energy distribution.

Covalent Attachment and Characterization of Perylene Monolayers on Si(111) and TiO2 for Electron-Selective Carrier Transport	LANGMUIR			English	Article							PEROVSKITE SOLAR-CELLS; DIIMIDES SYNTHESIS; ULTRATHIN FILMS; TIN OXIDE; LAYER; EFFICIENT; FULLERENE; STABILITY; SPECTROSCOPY; PERFORMANCE	We functionalized chemically oxidized Si(111) and TiO2 surfaces with covalently attached rylene molecules and demonstrated further chemical conversion of the attached species. Base-catalyzed activation of perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) preceded reaction with phenyl-aminosilane-terminated surfaces, yielding surface-bound perylene via an imide linkage. Transflection infrared (IR) spectroscopy of the carbonyl vibrational region elucidated the presence of anhydride, imide, and ester species following each reaction stage. The presence of both anhydride and imide IR features following reaction with PTCDA validates successful perylene attachment. Subsequent functionalization of the surface-attached perylenes yielded IR spectra with little or no detectable anhydride features that indicate successful conversion to ester or imide species based on respective reactions with alkyl bromides or aryl amines. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy quantified fractional coverages of surface-attached perylene species following a post-deposition derivatization with fluorine-containing alkyl bromides and with anilines. Overlayer model interpretation of the photoelectron results determined a perylene surface coverage of similar to 15% relative to the surface density of Si(111) atop sites and a similar to 10% surface coverage of imideterminated perylene species. The interpreted coverage data yield an approximate conversion efficiency for the anhydride-toimide derivatization at surface-attached perylenes of similar to 66%. We discuss the present results in terms of possible coverage and packing on oxide-free silicon surfaces and the utilization of covalently attached rylene species as electron-transporting and hole blocking connecting layers in molecular electronics and tandem-junction photovoltaic designs.

The imperfections in OIHP materials play an important role in the process of charge recombination and ion migration in perovskite solar cells (PSC), which heavily influences the resulting device energy conversion efficiency and stability. Here we review the recent advances in passivation of imperfections and suppressing ion migration to achieve improved efficiency and highly stable perovskite solar cells. Due to the ionic nature of OIHP materials, the defects in the photoactive films are inevitably electrically charged. The deep level traps induced by particular charged defects in OIHP films are major non-radiative recombination centers; passivation by coordinate bonding, ionic bonding, or chemical conversion have proven effective in mitigating the negative impacts of these deep traps. Shallow level charge traps themselves may contribute little to non-radiative recombination, but the migration of charged shallow level traps in OIHP films results in unfavorable band bending, interfacial reactions, and phase segregation, influencing the carrier extraction efficiency. Finally, the impact of defects and ion migration on the stability of perovskite solar cells is described.

On understanding bandgap bowing and optoelectronic quality in Pb-Sn alloy hybrid perovskites	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							DETAILED BALANCE LIMIT; DENSITY-OF-STATES; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; SOLAR-CELLS; LEAD; TIN; FORMAMIDINIUM; EFFICIENT; STABILITY	High quality small-bandgap hybrid perovskites (AMX(3) with M = Pb1-xSnx) are pivotal for all-perovskite multi-junction photovoltaics. The bandgap of these alloys significantly deviates from the linear interpolation between the bandgaps of APbI(3) and ASnI(3) for all A-site cations examined thus far. This non-linearity of the bandgap with composition is referred to as bandgap bowing. Here, we explore a wide-range of A-site compositions to understand bandgap bowing and identify the optimal Pb-Sn alloy composition. Optical and structural investigations of different APb(1-x)Sn(x)I(3) alloys reveal that the bandgap bowing is correlated with the extent of microstrain in their respective APbI(3) compounds. We discover that bandgap bowing in APb(1-x)Sn(x)I(3) alloys is primarily due to local structural relaxation effects (changes in bond angles and lengths) that result from the size, shape, and charge distribution of the cations on the A-site, and that these effects are intimately coupled with chemical effects (intermixing of atomic orbitals) that result from changes in the M-site. The choice of X-site also impacts bandgap bowing because of the X-site anions' influence on local structural relaxation and chemical effects. Further, we extend these results to provide a general rationale for the origin and modulation of bandgap bowing in HP alloys. Subsequently, using high-throughput combinational spray coating and photoluminescence analysis, we find that ternary combinations of methylammonium (MA), formamidinium (FA), and cesium (Cs) are beneficial to improve the optoelectronic quality of APb(1-x)Sn(x)I(3) alloys. The optimal composition, (MA(0.24)FA(0.61)Cs(0.15))(Pb0.35Sn0.65I3)I-3 has a desirable low bandgap (1.23 eV) and high optoelectronic quality (achieving 86% of the detailed balance limit quasi-Fermi level splitting). This study provides valuable insights regarding bandgap evolution in HP alloys and the optimal small-bandgap absorber composition desired for next-generation HP tandems.

By examining the concurrent evolution of ionic distribution and spontaneous polarization of CsFAMA under light illumination using dynamic-strain-based scanning probe microscopy, strong linear piezoelectricity arising from photoenhanced polarization is observed, while ionic migration is found to be not significantly increased by lightening. Nanoscale photocurrents are mapped under a series of biases using conductive atomic force microscopy, revealing negligible difference between forward and backward scans, and local IV curves reconstructed from principal component analysis show minimal hysteresis of just 1%. These observations at the nanoscale are confirmed in a macroscopic perovskite solar cell made of CsFAMA, exhibiting a high efficiency of 20.11% and with hysteresis index as small as 3%. Ionic migration, polarization, and photocurrent hysteresis are thus directly correlated at the nanoscale, and photoenhanced polarization in triple-cation mixed-halide perovskites is established, which does not contribute to the photovoltaic hysteresis.

Excitonic effects in this material have been subject to debate both for experiment and theory, indicating a need for better understanding of the screening mechanisms that act upon the electron-hole interaction. Here, we use cutting-edge first-principles theoretical spectroscopy, based on density-functional and many-body perturbation theory, to study atomic geometries, electronic structure, and optical properties of three MAPbI(3) polymorphs and find good agreement with earlier results and experiment. We then study the influence of free electrons on the electron-hole interaction and show that this explains consistently smaller exciton-binding energies, compared to those in the material without free electrons. Interestingly, we also find that the absorption line shape strongly resembles that of the spectrum without free electrons up to high free-electron concentrations. We explain this unexpected behavior by formation of Mahan excitons that dominate the absorption edge, making MAPbI(3) robust against free-electron-induced changes observed in other semiconductors.

Phase Stability and Diffusion in Lateral Heterostructures of Methyl Ammonium Lead Halide Perovskites	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						halide perovskite; mixed halide; diffusion; phase diagram; heterostructure; halide substitution; diffusion couple	SOLAR-CELLS; IODIDE; LIGHT; SEGREGATION; EFFICIENT; PERFORMANCE; NANOCRYSTALS; TRANSITIONS; CONVERSION; MANAGEMENT	Mixed halide hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites have band gaps that span the visible spectrum making them candidates for optoelectronic devices. Transport of the halide atoms in methyl ammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)) and its alloys with bromine has been observed in both dark and under illumination. While halide transport upon application of electric fields has received much attention, less is known regarding bromide and iodide interdiffusion down concentration gradients. This work provides an upper bound on the bromide iodide interdiffusion coefficient D-i in thin films of MAPb(BrxI1-x)(3) using a diffusion couples of lateral heterostructures. The upper bound of D-i was extracted from changes in the interface profiles of the heterostructures upon exposure to heat. The stability of thoroughly heated interfacial profiles suggests that the miscibility gap extends to higher temperatures and to a higher fractional composition of bromine than predicted by theory. The results of this work provide guidance for compositions of thermally stable heterostructures of hybrid halide perovskites.

For established narrow-band-gap CIGS thin-film bottom cells, a challenge is to develop highly efficient polycrystalline wide-band-gap top cells. Here, we demonstrate a 1.68-eV (FA(0.65)MA(0.20)Cs(0.15))Pb(I0.8Br0.2)(3) wide-band-gap perovskite solar cell with an efficiency of similar to 20% enabled by using PEAI and Pb(SCN)(2) complementary additives in the perovskite precursor. The coupling of PEA(+) and SCN- provides a synergistic effect that overcomes growth challenges with either additive individually and improves perovskite film quality with enhanced crystallinity, reduced formation of excess PbI2 (in comparison to using Pb(SCN)(2) additive alone), lower defect density and energetic disorder, and an improved carrier mobility (similar to 47 cm(2)V(-1)s(-1)) and lifetime (similar to 2.9 mu s). When coupling a semi-transparent 1.68-eV perovskite top cell fabricated by this approach with a 1 .1 2-eV CIGS bottom cell, we achieve 25.9%-efficient polycrystalline perovskite/CIGS 4-terminal thin-film tandem solar cells.

This hinders further improvement, and processing approaches remain largely empirical. We address the challenge by tracking the solidification of precursors in situ and linking the evolutions of different crystalline phases to the presence of Cs+ and Rb+. In their absence, the perovskite film is inherently unstable, segregating into MA-I- and FA-Br-rich phases. Adding either Cs+ or Rb+ is shown to alter the solidification process of the perovskite films. The optimal addition of both Cs+ and Rb+ drastically suppress phase segregation and promotes the spontaneous formation of the desired alpha phase. We propose that the synergistic effect is due to the collective benefits of Cs+ and Rb+ on the formation kinetics of the alpha phase and on the halide distribution throughout the film.

This work reports the substrate effects on the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in perovskite films through thermal expansion under thermal annealing. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements show that using a flexible polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) substrate introduces a smaller mechanical strain in perovskite MAPbI(3-x)Cl(x) films, as compared to conventional glass substrates. Interestingly, the linear/circular photoexcitation-modulated photocurrent studies find that decreasing mechanical strain gives rise to a weaker orbit-orbit interaction toward decreasing the SOC in the MAPbI(3-x)Cl(x) films prepared on flexible PEN substrates relative to rigid glass substrates. Simultaneously, decreasing the mechanical strain causes a reduction in the internal magnetic parameter inside the MAPbI(3-x)Cl(x) films, providing further evidence to show that introducing mechanical strain can affect the SOC in hybrid perovskite films upon using flexible substrates toward developing flexible perovskite thin-film devices. Furthermore, thermal admittance spectroscopy indicates that the trap states are increased in the perovskite films prepared on flexible PEN substrates as compared to glass substrates. Consequently, PEN and rigid glass substrates lead to shorter and longer photoluminescence lifetimes, respectively. Clearly, these findings provide an insightful understanding on substrate effects on optoelectronic properties in flexible perovskite thin-film devices.

However, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the state-of-the-art PSCs with small molecule dopant-free HTMs are below 20%. Herein, a simple dithieno[3,2-b:2 ',3 '-d]pyrrol-cored small molecule, DTP-C6Th, is reported as a promising dopant-free HTM. Compared with commonly used spiro-OMeTAD, DTP-C6Th exhibits a similar energy level, a better hole mobility of 4.18 x 10(-4) cm(2) V-1 s(-1), and more efficient hole extraction, enabling efficient and stable PSCs with a dopant-free HTM. With the addition of an ultrathin poly(methyl methacrylate) passivation layer and properly tuning the composition of the perovskite absorber layer, a champion PCE of 21.04% is achieved, which is the highest value for small molecule dopant-free HTM based PSCs to date. Additionally, PSCs using the DTP-C6Th HTM exhibit significantly improved long-term stability compared with the conventional cells with the metal additive doped spiro-OMeTAD HTM. Therefore, this work provides a new candidate and effective device engineering strategy for achieving high PCEs with dopant-free HTMs.	[Yin, Xinxing; Zhou, Jie; Dong, Zihao; Tang, Weihua] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Chem Engn, Nanjing 210094, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yin, Xinxing; Song, Zhaoning; Shrestha, Niraj; Bista, Sandip Singh; Ellingson, Randy J.; Yan, Yanfa] Univ Toledo, Dept Phys & Astron, Toledo, OH 43606 USA; [Yin, Xinxing; Song, Zhaoning; Shrestha, Niraj; Bista, Sandip Singh; Ellingson, Randy J.; Yan, Yanfa] Univ Toledo, Wright Ctr Photovolta Innovat & Commercializat, 2801 W Bancroft St, Toledo, OH 43606 USA; [Bao, Qinye] East China Normal Univ, Dept Optoelect, Key Lab Polar Mat & Devices, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China	Tang, WH (reprint author), Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Chem Engn, Nanjing 210094, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Yan, YF (reprint author), Univ Toledo, Dept Phys & Astron, Toledo, OH 43606 USA.; Yan, YF (reprint author), Univ Toledo, Wright Ctr Photovolta Innovat & Commercializat, 2801 W Bancroft St, Toledo, OH 43606 USA.	yanfa.yan@utoledo.edu; whtang@njust.edu.cn	Bao, Qinye/A-5110-2013; TANG, WEIHUA/B-8713-2008; Song, Zhaoning/J-2905-2017	TANG, WEIHUA/0000-0002-6233-3471; Song, Zhaoning/0000-0002-6677-0994	National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [51573077, 21875111, 51861145401]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; China Scholarship Council (CSC)China Scholarship Council [201706840039]; Air Force Research Laboratory [FA9453-18-2-0037]; Office of Naval ResearchOffice of Naval Research [N00014-17-1-2223]; Ohio Research Scholar Program	X.Y., J.Z., and Z.S. contributed equally to this work.

For the commercialization of devices employing hybrid perovskite materials, their mechanical properties critically influence the manufacturing, processing as well as the device durability, and hence need to be well understood. In this review, we summarize recent mechanical studies of the known HOIPs. Firstly, we present a comprehensive account of the relationship between crystal structures and properties, where the influence of different chemical and bonding factors on the load response of HOIPs are extensively discussed. The functional abnormalities of HOIP materials under the stress stimuli are also reviewed, addressing the effects of negative linear compressibility, negative Poisson's ratio and barocaloric effect. Finally, we briefly summarize the significant effect of strain and stress in thin-film halide perovskite materials, which have been widely employed in solar cells and Light-emitting diodes. This review aims to raise more awareness about the fundamental understanding of the mechanical properties of hybrid perovskite materials, and attract more research attention to this interdisciplinary field.

A major challenge for 21st century scientists is finding novel strategies, concepts and materials for replacing silicon-based CMOS semiconductor technologies and guaranteeing a continued and steady technological progress in next decades. Among the materials classes candidate to contribute to this momentous challenge, oxide films and heterostructures are a particularly appealing hunting ground. The vastity, intended in pure chemical terms, of this class of compounds, the complexity of their correlated behaviour, and the wealth of functional properties they display, has already made these systems the subject of choice, worldwide, of a strongly networked, dynamic and interdisciplinary research community. Oxide science and technology has been the target of a wide four-year project, named Towards Oxide-Based Electronics (TO-BE), that has been recently running in Europe and has involved as participants several hundred scientists from 29 EU countries. In this review and perspective paper, published as a final deliverable of the TO-BE Action, the opportunities of oxides as future electronic materials for Information and Communication Technologies ICT and Energy are discussed. The paper is organized as a set of contributions, all selected and ordered as individual building blocks of a wider general scheme. After a brief preface by the editors and an introductory contribution, two sections follow.

Due to their potential to achieve high carrier mobilities, organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite materials can enable high-performance, solution-processed field-effect transistors (FETs) for next-generation, low-cost, flexible electronic circuits and displays. However, the performance of perovskite FETs is hampered predominantly by device instabilities, whose origin remains poorly understood. Here, perovskite single-crystal FETs based on methylammonium lead bromide are studied and device instabilities due to electrochemical reactions at the interface between the perovskite and gold source-drain top contacts are investigated. Despite forming the contacts by a gentle, soft lamination method, evidence is found that even at such "ideal" interfaces, a defective, intermixed layer is formed at the interface upon biasing of the device. Using a bottom-contact, bottom-gate architecture, it is shown that it is possible to minimize such a reaction through a chemical modification of the electrodes, and this enables fabrication of perovskite single-crystal FETs with high mobility of up to approximate to 15 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) at 80 K. This work addresses one of the key challenges toward the realization of high-performance solution-processed perovskite FETs.

Normally, 2D perovskites contain a monocation [e.g., methylammonium (MA(+)) or formamidinium (FA(+))]. Reported here for the first time is the fabrication of 2D perovskites (n=5) with mixed cations of MA(+), FA(+), and cesium (Cs+). The use of these triple cations leads to the formation of a smooth, compact surface morphology with larger grain size and fewer grain boundaries compared to the conventional MA-based counterpart. The resulting perovskite also exhibits longer carrier lifetime and higher conductivity in triple cation 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2D PSCs with triple cations was enhanced by more than 80 % (from 7.80 to 14.23 %) compared to PSCs fabricated with a monocation. The PCE is also higher than that of PSCs based on binary cation (MA(+)-FA(+) or MA(+)-Cs+) 2D structures.

Improvements in device stability and reliability require methods to visualize point defect migration, estimate ionic mobilities, and identify factors influencing their migration. In this work, a versatile method is demonstrated to track nonradiative point defect migration in situ. Photoluminescence mapping of laterally biased perovskite films is used to track continuous changes in nonradiative recombination as charge-trapping defects migrate between the device electrodes. A Monte Carlo framework of defect drift and diffusion is developed that is consistent with experimental photoluminescence observations, which combined enables point defect mobility estimation in methylammonium lead iodide films. Furthermore, measurements performed on materials with varied grain sizes demonstrate that point defect mobility is 1500x faster at grain boundaries compared to bulk. These findings imply that grain morphology can be used to tune point defect mobility such that large-grained or single-crystal materials inhibit point defect migration. The methods used in this work can be applied to visualize and quantify the migration of charge-trapping point defects in a wide range of state-of-the-art perovskite materials targeted toward reduced ionic mobilities and superior device stability.

In this work, a vapor-assisted method with the combination of spin-coating and thermal evaporation is employed to fabricate the double-layer PbI2/PbIxBr(2-x) precursor. It is found that surface morphologies of perovskite films could be tailored through tuning the spin-coating speed (the first precursor layer) and chemical compositions (the second precursor layer). The continuous pinhole-free perovskite films are successfully fabricated by double-layer PbI2/PbBr2 precursors. The open-circuit voltages of all the corresponding cells exceed 1.00 V, showing an average value of 1.02 V. The high mean voltage and small variation reveals high repeatability of this method. This work provides a potential method to achieve large-area and high-efficiency PSCs.

Selective injection of holes through electrochemical anodic bias has allowed us to probe the effect of hole trapping at iodide (0.9 V) and bromide (1.15 V) in mixed halide perovskite (CH3NH3PbB1.5I1.5) films. Upon trapping holes at the iodide site, the iodide gradually gets expelled from the mixed halide film (as iodine and/or triiodide ion), leaving behind re-formed CH3NH3PbBr3 domains. The weakening of the Pb-I bond following the hole trapping (oxidation of the iodide site) and its expulsion from the lattice in the form of iodine provided further insight into the photoinduced segregation of halide ions in mixed halide perovskite films. Transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that the iodide expulsion process leaves a defect-rich perovskite lattice behind as charge carrier recombination in the re-formed lattice is greatly accelerated. The selective mobility of iodide species provides insight into the photoinduced phase segregation and its implication in the stable operation of perovskite solar cells.

The achievable performance gains from photon recycling in metal halide perovskite solar cells remain uncertain due to high variability in material quality and the nonradiative recombination rate. We quantify the enhancement due to photon recycling for state-of-the-art perovskite Cs-0.05(MA(0.17)FA(0.83))(0.95)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)(3) (triple-cation) films and corresponding solar cells. We show that, at the maximum power point (MPP), the absolute PCE can increase up to 2.0% in the radiative limit, primarily due to a 77 mV increase in (V-MPP). For this photoactive layer, even with finite nonradiative recombination, benefits from photon recycling can be achieved when nonradiative lifetimes and external light-emitting diode (LED) electroluminescence efficiencies, Q(e)(LED), exceed 2 mu s and 10%, respectively. This analysis quantifies the significance of photon recycling in boosting the real-world performance of perovskite solar cells toward theoretical limits.

Structural Diversity in Cesium Bismuth Halide Nanocrystals	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; LEAD-FREE; ANION-EXCHANGE; PHOTOVOLTAIC PERFORMANCE; PEROVSKITE NANOCRYSTALS; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; SOLAR-CELLS; BAND-GAP; CS3BI2I9; RB	Cesium bismuth halides (Cs-Bi-X) have recently been the subject of considerable attention as possible less-toxic alternatives to lead halide perovskites for luminescence and photovoltaics applications, but the full range of synthetically accessible Cs-Bi-X compositions has not been thoroughly explored, and some inconsistent results have appeared in the literature. Here, we have used a combination of hot-injection synthesis and post-synthetic anion exchange to prepare Cs-Bi-X nanocrystals with many structures and compositions, including several that have not previously been characterized. The structural and optical properties of Cs3BiX6 (X = Cl, Br, I) nanocrystals and Cs3Bi2X9 (X = Cl, Br, I) nanoplatelets are reported, and interconversion of these structures between different halide compositions is demonstrated through anion exchange using trimethylsilyl halides. Notably, we find that anion exchange can be used to access structural polymorphs not readily prepared through direct synthesis. In particular, a new structural modification of Cs3Bi2I9 has been accessed; whereas hot injection gives the previously reported "zero-dimensional" nonperovskite structure, anion exchange provides access to a "two-dimensional" layered, ordered-vacancy perovskite phase with a red-shifted absorption spectrum and distinctly different photoluminescence. Spectroscopic and computational characterization of these materials provides insight into structure/property relationships, including properties of the layered Cs3Bi2I9 material, that may be advantageous for optoelectronic applications.

Here, we report on a new, inorganic, double perovskite oxide semiconductor: KBaTeBiO6, which has an experimental indirect band gap of 1.88 eV and shows excellent stability. We combined data analytics and high throughput density functional theory calculations to search through thousands of hypothetical inorganic double perovskite oxides containing bismuth and predict KBaTeBiO6 as a potential photovoltaic material, which was subsequently synthesized using a wet-chemistry route. The calculated effective mass of the charge carriers for KBaTeBiO6 is comparable to the best performing Bi-halide double perovskites. Our work demonstrates the untapped potential of inorganic Bi-based double perovskite oxides that offer the ability to change both the cation combination and their stoichiometry to achieve desired electronic properties as exciting, benign, and stable alternatives to lead-halide perovskites for various semiconducting applications.

Cation Alloying Delocalizes Polarons in Lead Halide Perovskites	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article							ELECTRON-TRANSFER REACTIONS; SOLAR-CELLS; INORGANIC PEROVSKITES; EFFICIENT; LIGHT; PERFORMANCE; CESIUM; STABILIZATION; PHOTOVOLTAICS; PHASE	Recently, mixed-cation perovskites have promised enhanced performances concerning stability and efficiency in optoelectronic devices. Here, we report a systematic study on the effects of cation alloying on polaronic properties in cation-alloyed perovskites using first principle calculations. We find that cation alloying significantly reduces the polaron binding energies for both electrons and holes compared to pure methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3). This is rationalized in terms of crystal symmetry reduction that causes polarons to be more delocalized. Electron polarons undergo large Jahn-Teller distortions (similar to 15-30%), whereas hole polarons tend to shrink the lattice by similar to 5%. Such different lattice distortion footprints could be utilized to distinguish the type of polarons. Finally, our simulations show that Cs, formamidinium (FA), and MA mixtures can effectively minimize polaron binding energy while weakly affecting band gap, in a good agreement with experimental findings. These modeling results can guide future development of halide perovskite materials compositions for optoelectronic applications.

Nonadiabatic molecular dynamics combined with time-domain ab initio density functional theory allows one to mimic time-resolved spectroscopy experiments at the atomistic level of detail. The focus is placed on realistic aspects of perovskite materials, including point defects, surfaces, grain boundaries, mixed stoichiometries, dopants, and interfaces. The atomistic description of the quantum dynamics of electron and hole trapping and recombination, provided by the time-domain ab initio simulations, generates important insights into the mechanisms of charge and energy losses and guides the development of high-performance perovskite solar cell devices.

By rapidly transferring single charge carriers instead of bound triplet states, perovskites enable a high triplet population in rubrene, yielding low I-th values. In this contribution, we investigate the role of the triplet population on the upconverted emission. Interestingly, two independent rates of TTA can be observed, as well as a sharp drop in the visible emission intensity over several seconds. This effect can be attributed to the triplet-density-based diffusion length: (i) at low triplet populations slow diffusion-mediated TTA yields singlets far from the interface and (ii) higher triplet populations lead to rapid TTA close to the perovskite/rubrene interface. Because of the proximity of the strongly absorbing perovskite, the singlet states created closer to the interface undergo stronger back-transfer to the perovskite film and therefore appear to exhibit a lower photoluminescence quantum yield.

Hole-Transport Layer Molecular Weight and Doping Effects on Perovskite Solar Cell Efficiency and Mechanical Behavior	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						PTAA; molecular weight; perovskite solar cell; mechanical properties; stability	PERFORMANCE; COLLECTION; STABILITY; KINETICS; ADHESION; FILMS	The effect of tuning molecular weight (M-n) in poly[bis (4-phenyl) (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) to increase both mechanical properties of the film and electrical properties of perovskite solar cells is reported. Perovskite solar cell devices are fabricated to investigate the effect of M-n on power conversion efficiency. Moisture stability for various M-n is also studied in PTAA films exposed to mechanical loads in humid environments. Furthermore, cohesion and tensile tests are employed to determine the mechanical properties of PTAA, where higher M-n leads to more robust films. To elucidate the effect of M-n on the debonding kinetics, a viscoelastic fracture kinetic model is proposed as a function of M-n, and the debonding mechanism is found to be dependent on M-n. Finally, the effect of small-molecule-based dopants on the mechanical stability of PTAA is investigated.

Here, a simple but effective strategy is developed to improve the cell performance of perovskite solar cells via the combination of internal doping by a ferroelectric polymer and external control by an electric field. A group of polarized ferroelectric (PFE) polymers are doped into the methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)) layer and/or inserted between the perovskite and the hole-transporting layers to enhance the build-in field (BIF), improve the crystallization of MAPbI(3), and regulate the nonradiative recombination in perovskite solar cells. The PFE polymer-doped MAPbI(3) shows an orderly arrangement of MA(+) cations, resulting in a preferred growth orientation of polycrystalline perovskite films with reduced trap states. In addition, the BIF is enhanced by the widened depletion region in the device. As an interfacial dipole layer, the PFE polymer plays a critical role in increasing the BIF. This combined effect leads to a substantial reduction in voltage loss of 0.14 V due to the efficient suppression of nonradiative recombination. Consequently, the resulting perovskite solar cells present a power conversion efficiency of 21.38% with a high open-circuit voltage of 1.14 V.

The results suggested that the substitution of Ti4+ at the five-fold coordinated (Ti-5c) sites by transition metals is energetically favored. The substituted interface has enhanced visible light sensitivity and photoelectrocatalytic activity by reducing the transition energies. The transition metal substitution can effectively tune the band gap of the interface, which significantly improves the photo-reactivity. The substituted systems are expected to be more efficient in separating the photo-generated electrons-holes and active in the visible spectrum.

By choosing a mixture of butanol and water as a solvent, the crystallinity is enhanced and the crystallization temperature is lowered to 130 degrees C, making the process fully compatible with flexible plastic substrates. The best solar cells fabricated using these layers achieve an efficiency of 20.52% (average 19.02%) which is among the best in the class of planar n-i-p-type perovskite (MAPbI(3)) solar cells. The strongly reduced crystallization temperature of the materials allows their use on a flexible substrate, with a resulting device efficiency of 18%.

Here, the photoelectric synaptic plasticity based on 2D lead-free perovskite ((PEA)(2)SnI4) is demonstrated. The devices show a photocurrent activation in response to a light stimulus in a neuron-like way and exhibit several essential synaptic functions such as short-term plasticity (STP) and long-term plasticity (LTP) as well as their transmission based on spike frequency control. The strength of synaptic connectivity can be effectively modulated by the duration, irradiance, and wavelength of light spikes. The ternary structure of (PEA)(2)SnI4 causes it to possess varied photoelectric properties by composition control, which enhances the complexity and freedoms required by neuromorphic computing. The physical mechanisms of the memory effect are attributed to two distinct lifetimes of photogenerated carrier trapping/detrapping processes modulated by controlling the proportion of Sn vacancies. This work demonstrates the great potential of (PEA)(2)SnI4 as a platform to develop future multifunctional artificial neuromorphic systems.

Addition of the Lewis Acid Zn(C6F5)(2) Enables Organic Transistors with a Maximum Hole Mobility in Excess of 20 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)	ADVANCED MATERIALS			English	Article						carrier mobility; Lewis acid; molecular doping; organic semiconductors; organic thin-film transistors	THIN-FILM TRANSISTORS; FIELD-EFFECT TRANSISTORS; PEROVSKITE SOLAR-CELLS; THRESHOLD VOLTAGE; PERFORMANCE; TRIS(PENTAFLUOROPHENYL)BORANE; SEMICONDUCTORS; TRANSPORT; EXTRACTION; EFFICIENCY	Incorporating the molecular organic Lewis acid tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)(3)] into organic semiconductors has shown remarkable promise in recent years for controlling the operating characteristics and performance of various opto/electronic devices, including, light-emitting diodes, solar cells, and organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs). Despite the demonstrated potential, however, to date most of the work has been limited to B(C6F5)(3) with the latter serving as the prototypical air-stable molecular Lewis acid system. Herein, the use of bis(pentafluorophenyl)zinc [Zn(C6F5)(2)] is reported as an alternative Lewis acid additive in high-hole-mobility OTFTs based on small-molecule:polymer blends comprising 2,7-dioctyl[1]benzothieno [3,2-b][1]benzothiophene and indacenodithiophene-benzothiadiazole. Systematic analysis of the materials and device characteristics supports the hypothesis that Zn(C6F5)(2) acts simultaneously as a p-dopant and a microstructure modifier. It is proposed that it is the combination of these synergistic effects that leads to OTFTs with a maximum hole mobility value of 21.5 cm(2) V-1 s(-1). The work not only highlights Zn(C6F5)(2) as a promising new additive for next-generation optoelectronic devices, but also opens up new avenues in the search for high-mobility organic semiconductors.

An interface stabilized perovskite solar cell with high stabilized efficiency and low voltage loss	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							IODIDE; HYSTERESIS	Stabilization of the crystal phase of inorganic/organic lead halide perovskites is critical for their high performance optoelectronic devices. However, due to the highly ionic nature of perovskite crystals, even phase stabilized polycrystalline perovskites can undergo undesirable phase transitions when exposed to a destabilizing environment. While various surface passivating agents have been developed to improve the device performance of perovskite solar cells, conventional deposition methods using a protic polar solvent, mainly isopropyl alcohol (IPA), results in a destabilization of the underlying perovskite layer and an undesirable degradation of device properties. We demonstrate the hidden role of IPA in surface treatments and develop a strategy in which the passivating agent is deposited without destabilizing the high quality perovskite underlayer. This strategy maximizes and stabilizes device performance by suppressing the formation of the perovskite delta-phase and amorphous phase during surface treatment, which is observed using conventional methods. Our strategy also effectively passivates surface and grain boundary defects, minimizing non-radiative recombination sites, and preventing carrier quenching at the perovskite interface. This results in an open-circuit-voltage loss of only similar to 340 mV, a champion device with a power conversion efficiency of 23.4% from a reverse current-voltage scan, a device with a record certified stabilized PCE of 22.6%, and enhanced operational stability. In addition, our perovskite solar cell exhibits an electroluminescence external quantum efficiency up to 8.9%.

J	Li, YH; Yang, KS				Li, Yuheng; Yang, Kesong			High-throughput computational design of organic-inorganic hybrid halide semiconductors beyond perovskites for optoelectronics	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							LEAD-FREE PEROVSKITES; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURES; RATIONAL DESIGN; SOLAR-CELLS; STABILITY; CRYSTAL; CATION; RB; BR	Organic-inorganic lead halide perovskites show great promise in optoelectronic applications such as light-emitting diodes and solar energy conversion. However, the poor stability and toxicity of lead halide perovskites severely limit their large-scale applications. Here we show a high-throughput design of lead-free hybrid halide semiconductors with robust materials stability and desired material properties beyond perovskites. On the basis of 24 prototype structures that include perovskite and non-perovskite structures and several typical organic cations, a comprehensive quantum materials repository that contains 4507 hypothetical hybrid compounds was built using large-scale first-principles calculations. After a high-throughput screening of this repository, we have rapidly identified 23 candidates for light-emitting diodes and 13 candidates for solar energy conversion. Our work demonstrates a new avenue to design novel organic-inorganic functional materials by exploring a great variety of prototype structures.

Interfacial Effects during Rapid Lamination within MAPbI(3) Thin Films and Solar Cells	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						perovskite; solar cell; photovoltaics; lamination; interfacial reaction	HALIDE PEROVSKITES; HYBRID PEROVSKITE; CARRIER LIFETIMES; TOP ELECTRODE; TRANSPARENT; EFFICIENT; IODIDE; ACID; CRYSTALLIZATION; DISSOLUTION	Although hybrid halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently reached record efficiency among thin film photovoltaic technologies, the stability of these devices remains a pressing problem for commercialization. Lamination processes represent an attractive means of fabricating PSCs due to their self-encapsulating nature and compatibility with high-throughput manufacturing methods. These techniques often involve high temperature and pressure, which represents an underexplored region of the perovskite processing parameter space. In this work, we investigate the behavior of the archetypal halide perovskite, methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)), under elevated temperatures and pressures. We also characterize the interactions of MAPbI(3) with the commonly used electron and hole transport layers (ETL and HTL) SnO, and NiO and find that the latter is particularly susceptible to detrimental interactions at temperatures not far above those commonly used in conventional perovskite film deposition techniques, with deleterious effects on device performance. SnO2 can also evince reactions with the perovskite precursor methylammonium iodide but is more robust than NiOx Applying the above knowledge, we investigate a laminated bifacial device fabrication strategy that mitigates intrinsic and interface-related threats to the perovskite absorber and report that such devices can reach power conversion efficiencies of >12%. These results not only advance the state of the art in laminated PSCs but also reveal heretofore unknown interactions in commonplace device architectures that should be taken into account when developing device fabrication schemes.

To date, it is still a challenge to simultaneously reduce the surface defects and improve the crystallinity in ETLs during their low-temperature processing. Here, a novel strategy for the mediation of in situ regrowth of SnO2 nanocrystal ETLs is reported: introduction of controlled trace amounts of surface absorbed water on the fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) or indium-tin oxide (ITO) surfaces of the substrates using ultraviolet ozone (UVO) pretreatment. The optimum amount of adsorbed water plays a key role in balancing the hydrolysis-condensation reactions during the structural evolution of SnO2 thin films. This new approach results in a full-coverage SnO2 ETL with a desirable morphology and crystallinity for superior optical and electrical properties, as compared to the control SnO2 ETL without the UVO pretreatment. Finally, the rigid and flexible PSC devices based on the new SnO2 ETLs yield high PCEs of up to 20.5% and 17.5%, respectively.

In this work, an efficient surface passivation method for emerging CsPbI3 perovskite QDs using a variety of inorganic cesium salts (cesium acetate (CsAc), cesium idodide (CsI), cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3), and cesium nitrate (CsNO3)) is reported. The Cs-salts post-treatment can not only fill the vacancy at the CsPbI3 perovskite surface but also improve electron coupling between CsPbI3 QDs. As a result, the free carrier lifetime, diffusion length, and mobility of QD film are simultaneously improved, which are beneficial for fabricating high-quality conductive QD films for efficient solar cell devices. After optimizing the post-treatment process, the short-circuit current density and fill factor are significantly enhanced, delivering an impressive efficiency of 14.10% for CsPbI3 QD solar cells. In addition, the Cs-salt-treated CsPbI3 QD devices exhibit improved stability against moisture due to the improved surface environment of these QDs. These findings will provide insight into the design of high-performance and low-trap-states perovskite QD films with desirable optoelectronic properties.

Specifically, nonradiative recombination losses ( increment V-nr) are much greater in OPVs than in silicon or perovskite solar cells, yet the origins of this are not fully understood. To understand what makes a system have high or low loss, an investigation of the nonradiative recombination losses in a total of nine blend systems is carried out. An apparent relationship is observed between the relative domain purity of six blends and the degree of nonradiative recombination loss, where films exhibiting relatively less pure domains show lower increment V-nr than films with higher domain purity. Additionally, it is shown that when paired with a fullerene acceptor, polymer donors which have bulky backbone units to inhibit close pi-pi stacking exhibit lower nonradiative recombination losses than in blends where the polymer can pack more closely. This work reports a strategy that ensures increment V-nr can be measured accurately and reports key observations on the relationship between increment V-nr and properties of the donor/acceptor interface.

The approach provided in the present work can be used to improve the studies of microstructure-property relationships in various relevant photovoltaic material systems with similar pseudosymmetrical crystal structures, such as kesterite-type or halide-perovskite thin films.

Here, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) correlated to transient absorption microscopy (TAM) on CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite particles is used to identify a defect state similar to 60 meV into the band gap at GBs, which accelerates carrier cooling and act as additional energy acceptors. An in-depth statistical analysis performed on a large data set (806 distinct spatial locations) reveals that the shallow defect state, generally considered to be benign, plays a significant role in accelerating carrier cooling, which is detrimental to hot carrier solar cells.

Improved Environmental Stability and Solar Cell Efficiency of (MA,FA)PbI3 Perovskite Using a Wide-Band-Gap 1D Thiazolium Lead Iodide Capping Layer Strategy	ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; PERFORMANCE; DURABILITY; 2D	There is strong interest in improving the environmental stability of hybrid perovskite solar cells while maintaining high efficiency. Here, we solve this problem by using epilayers of a wide-band-gap 1D lead iodide perovskitoid structure, based on a short organic cation, namely, thiazole ammonium (TA) in the form of lead iodide (TAPbI(3)). The 1D capping layer serves to passivate three-dimensional (3D) perovskite films, which promotes charge transport, improves carrier lifetime, and prevents iodide ion migration of the 3D (MA,FA)PbI3 film (MA = methylammonium, FA = formamidinium). Furthermore, the corresponding device achieved considerable efficiency and better environmental stability than the -based analogue, delivering a champion PCE value of 18.97% while retaining 92% of this efficiency under ambient conditions in air for 2 months. These findings suggest that utilization of a 1D perovskitoid is an effective strategy to improve the environmental stability of 3D-based perovskite solar cell devices maintaining at the same time their high efficiency.

However, replacing the lead with less-toxic elements while maintaining a high PCE remains a challenge. For this reason, there has been significant effort to develop Pb-free compounds, including methylammonium bismuth iodide (MA(3)Bi(2)I(9)), but such systems severely underperform when compared with the prototypical Pb-based methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)). For the latter, it is known that lead complexes with polar solvents, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and dimethylformamide (DMF), to form iodoplumbates which can co-crystallize into solvated phases. Herein, the solidification and growth behaviors of Bi- and Pb-based films is investigated using multi-probe in situ characterization methods. It is shown that the Bi-based compound crystallizes directly and rapidly into a textured polycrystalline microstructure from a precursor solution without evolving through intermediate crystalline solvated phases, in contrast to MAPbI(3). This solidification process produces isolated crystals and challenges the growth of continuous and crystalline films required for solar cells. It is revealed that solvent engineering with antisolvent dripping is crucial to enable the formation of continuous polycrystalline films of MA(3)Bi(2)I(9) and functional solar cells thereof.

Irradiance and temperature considerations in the design and deployment of high annual energy yield perovskite/CIGS tandems	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; EFFICIENCY; MODULES; CUINSE2; LAYERS; MODEL	The annual energy yields for metal halide perovskite/copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) tandem photovoltaics have been calculated for 16 different bandgap combinations, using both 2 terminal and 4 terminal device designs, with fixed-tilt mounting as well as 1- and 2-axis tracking. Measured complex index of refraction data were used for the materials comprising the devices, and hourly irradiance data were extracted from Version 3 of the National Solar Radiation Database. Simulations were performed for Toledo OH, Golden CO, Phoenix AZ, and New Orleans LA, and the effect of local temperature variation was also considered. The combination of irradiance and temperature variations throughout the year cause different devices to be optimal at different times of the year. Interestingly, devices constructed to maximize AM1.5 photoconversion efficiency do not necessarily maximize the annual energy yield. A detailed analysis of the monthly energy yields at the different locations reveals the interplay between the changing light and temperature conditions. Over the course of the year these effects average to some degree so that annual energy yields that are close to the maximum possible value can be achieved by several different tandem device designs. The conclusions are valid for devices made with relatively thin perovskite layers, such as those used in champion efficiency devices. When the perovskite layers are thicker, however, the device is less tolerant to variation. Our results show that close matching of bandgap pairs is not essential for the fabrication of high-performance tandems. These findings should allow manufacturing efforts to proceed without the need for precise compositional control during formation of the absorber layers.

Recently metal halide perovskites with ABX(3) structure have been extensively investigated as new generation semiconductors for various optoelectronic devices, including photovoltaic cells, light emitting diodes, photodetectors, and lasers, for their exceptional optical and electronic properties. By controlling the morphological dimensionality, low dimensional metal halide perovskites, including 2D perovskite nanoplatelets, 1D perovskite nanowires, and OD perovskite quantum dots, have been developed to exhibit distinct properties from their bulk counterparts, due to quantum size effects. Besides ABX(3) perovskites, organic-inorganic metal halide hybrids, containing the same fundamental building block of metal halide octahedra (BX6), can also be assembled to possess other types of crystallographic structures. Using appropriate organic and inorganic components, low dimensional organic-inorganic metal halide hybrids with 2D, quasi-2D, corrugated-2D, 1D, and OD structures at the molecular level have been developed and studied. Due to the strong quantum confinement and site isolation, these low dimensional metal halide hybrids at the molecular level exhibit remarkable and unique properties that are significantly different from those of ABX(3) perovskites. In light of the rapid development of low dimensional metal halide perovskites and hybrids, it is indeed timely to review the recent progress in these areas. Also, there is a need to clarify the difference between morphological low dimensional metal halide perovskites and molecular level low dimensional metal halide hybrids, as currently the terminologies of low dimensional perovskites are not appropriately used in many cases. In this review article, we discuss the synthesis, characterization, application, and computational studies of low dimensional metal halide perovskites and hybrids.

In our present approach, we select poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA) as the hole-transport material and use an inverted solar cell planar structure. We propose a sequential method to dope the PTAA thin film in order to reduce the solar cell's series resistance. A modified inter-diffusion method is adopted to improve the perovskite film. We optimize the solvent-assisted annealing condition to maximize the perovskite grain size and reduce the pin-hole density. The impact of PTAA's doping concentration on the solar cell's PV performance is investigated. Compared to conventional PEDOT:PSS-based perovskite solar cell, we observe an improvement in both the open-circuit voltage and the short-circuit current, resulting in a power conversion efficiency enhancement from 12.7% to 15.3%.

Here, we report the degradation mechanism of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with inverted structure of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/Cu:NiOx/MAPbI(3)/PC61BM/Ag. The oxidative degradation of PC61 BM electron transport layer forms pinholes and leads to the water-catalyzed decomposition of perovskites. The formation of silver iodide confirms the iodine is from decomposition of perovskites. The instability of inverted PSCs based on Cu:NiOx is owing to corrosive behavior of silver electrode. In addition, we find that a small amount of bromine doping in the perovskite material can delay the corrosion of the silver electrode. This paper demonstrates it is essential to deeply understand the degradation mechanism of the devices and a small amount of bromine doping is a feasible strategy to suppress the corrosion of the silver electrodes.

However, wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells usually suffer from large open circuit voltage (V-oc) deficits caused by small grain sizes and photoinduced phase segregation. Here, we demonstrate that in addition to large grain sizes and passivated grain boundaries, controlling interface properties is critical for achieving high V-oc's in the inverted wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells. We adopt guanidinium bromide solution to tune the effective doping and electronic properties of the surface layer of perovskite thin films, leading to the formation of a graded perovskite homojunction. The enhanced electric field at the perovskite homojunction is revealed by Kelvin probe force microscopy measurements. This advance enables an increase in the V-oc of the inverted perovskite solar cells from an initial 1.12 V to 1.24 V. With the optimization of the device fabrication process, the champion inverted wide-bandgap cell delivers a power conversion efficiency of 18.19% and sustains more than 72% of its initial efficiency after continuous illumination for 70 h without encapsulation. Additionally, a semitransparent device with an indium tin oxide back contact retains more than 88% of its initial efficiency after 100 h maximum power point tracking.

To date, impressive efficiency has been realized from the state-of-the-art solar cells through generic interface engineering and film morphological manipulation of perovskite active-layer in macroscopic scale. To further boost the efficiency of perovskite solar cells, microscopically tuning optoelectronic properties of hybrid perovskite materials represents a promising direction. In this study, we report efficient perovskite solar cells by a novel hybrid perovskites material that is incorporated with heterovalent neodymium cations (Nd3+). As compared with pristine hybrid perovskite materials, Nd3+-doped hybrid perovskite materials possess superior film quality with highly reduced trap-states, significantly enlarged charge carrier lifetimes, dramatically enhanced and balanced charge carrier mobilities. As a result, planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells by Nd3+-doped hybrid perovskite materials exhibit highly reproducible power conversion efficiency of 21.15% and significantly suppressed photocurrent hysteresis. These findings open a new window of tuning the optoelectronic properties of hybrid perovskite materials and boosting the device performance of perovskite solar cells. 21.15% power conversion efficiency and significantly suppressed photocurrent hysteresis were demonstrated from planar heterojunction perovskite solar cell using heterovalent neodymium cation doped hybrid perovskite materials.

Droplet-based coating route, comprising inkjet printing, aerosol jet, and spray coating, is a viable deposition approach for high volume manufacturing of such devices. Perovskites are emerging ionic solutions deposited on unconventional substrates, where their droplet impact dynamics and deposition behavior is unexplored. In this work, we studied the impact dynamics of popular perovskite solution droplets, i.e. methylammonium lead halides (CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3-xClx) on three surfaces, viz. glass coated with thin films of PEDOT:PSS, and compact and mesoporous TiO2, widely used in emerging optoelectronic devices. Droplets of two solutions, with initial diameter similar to 2.2 mm, were impacted onto three substrates, with impinging velocities of 1.40, 1.72, and 1.98 m/s, generating 18 experimental conditions, in the range of 176 < We < 402, where We is the Weber number. Using top- and side-view high-speed imaging, we studied temporal evolution trend in kinematic and spreading stages, and maximum droplet spreading in the wetting stage. We also analyzed the prediction power of existing scaling laws, theoretical and semi-empirical models for maximum spreading diameter with respect to droplet initial diameter, beta(max), against perovskite solution droplets. We found that for the common coated substrates used here, and also in photovoltaic devices, the relative roughness with respect to droplet size was small, and the coated substrates were quite wetting with small contact angles. Thus, the perovskite solution droplet spreading was found to be a function of the We number, according to an existing scaling law and correlation for common liquids, where the coefficient of the correlation was tuned for methylammonium perovskite solution droplets by curve fitting, yielding a modified empirical correlation in the form of beta(max) = 0.8We(0.25).

The fragility of perovskite crystals and quality of perovskite films on flexible substrate are main challenges for the further improvement. Recently, some polymer additive, such as poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) assistance method for crystal growth have been widely reported. However, the fragile PMMA could not provide a desirable mechanical endurance for flexible PSCs. Here, we demonstrate a polymer alloy, which can simultaneously benefit the crystal growth and improve the flexibility. With this approach, a fully covered and compact perovskite film is achieved with a smooth surface. As a result, an enhanced efficiency of 17.54% and 14.01% for rigid and flexible PSCs is demonstrated, respectively. More importantly, the polymer alloy dramatically improves the mechanical stability of the devices, which shows a great potential for future applications in wearable electronics.

The all-conjugated two-dimensional structure effectively increases the ionization potential, realizing a high open-circuit voltage near 1 V for the 2D-PT-based PSC. Very interestingly, the two-dimensional wide-angle X-ray scattering measurements show that the 2D-PT molecules are self-assembled into ordered structure with a face-on dominant orientation and exhibit a hole mobility, which is similar to 1.6 times faster than that of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). Consequently, the power conversion efficiency of PSC is noticeably increased by similar to 30% as 2D-PT replaces P3HT as HTM. Moreover, the densely packed 2D-PT slows down the moisture induced degradation of perovskite crystals, leading to a better environmental stability. This work demonstrates that two-dimensional non-donor-acceptor structural conjugated polymers can be utilized as promising HTM of PSCs.

In this work, we present two novel strategies to significantly improve the stability of PSCs using environmental humidity and down-shifting quantum dots (QDs). We first improve the crystallinity of double-cation Cs/FA perovskite by annealing films in 40% relative humidity (RH). Our results reveal that the grain size, carrier lifetime and crystallinity of perovskite films are enhanced drastically due to the humidity. Next, we apply a thin layer of CdSe/CdS quantum dots (QDs) on the back of the device to convert high energy UV light into lower energy visible wavelengths. Using this modification, we improve not only the UV stability but also the device performance of the PSCs. Based on these modifications, we achieve an inverted PSC with a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.7%. Moreover, our modified device shows a great operational stability under continuous illumination after 300h with only 15% PCE loss. We also examine the UV stability of our devices and find that the modified PSC retains 79% of its initial PCE after 150 h under continuous illumination outperforming the reference device.

High efficiency perovskite quantum dot solar cells with charge separating heterostructure	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							HOMOJUNCTION; EXTRACTION; ELECTRON	Metal halide perovskite semiconductors possess outstanding characteristics for optoelectronic applications including but not limited to photovoltaics. Low-dimensional and nanostructured motifs impart added functionality which can be exploited further. Moreover, wider cation composition tunability and tunable surface ligand properties of colloidal quantum dot (QD) perovskites now enable unprecedented device architectures which differ from thin-film perovskites fabricated from solvated molecular precursors. Here, using layer-by-layer deposition of perovskite QDs, we demonstrate solar cells with abrupt compositional changes throughout the perovskite film. We utilize this ability to abruptly control composition to create an internal heterojunction that facilitates charge separation at the internal interface leading to improved photocarrier harvesting. We show how the photovoltaic performance depends upon the heterojunction position, as well as the composition of each component, and we describe an architecture that greatly improves the performance of perovskite QD photovoltaics.

Direct capture of solar energy for organic synthesis is a promising approach. Lead (Pb)-halide perovskite solar cells reach 24.2% power conversion efficiency, rendering perovskite a unique type material for solar energy capture. We argue that photophysical properties of perovskites already proved for photovoltaics, also should be of interest in photoredox organic synthesis. Because the key aspects of these two applications are both relying on charge separation and transfer. Here we demonstrated that perovskites nanocrystals are exceptional candidates as photocatalysts for fundamental organic reactions, for example C-C, C-N and C-O bond-formations. Stability of CsPbBr3 in organic solvents and ease-of-tuning their bandedges garner perovskite a wider scope of organic substrate activations. Our low-cost, easy-to-process, highly-efficient, air-tolerant and bandedge-tunable perovskites may bring new breakthrough in organic chemistry.

BaZrSe 3: Ab initio study of anion substitution for bandgap tuning in a chalcogenide material	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; PEROVSKITE SOLAR-CELLS; PSEUDOPOTENTIALS; EFFICIENCY; DYNAMICS	Recently, transition metal perovskite chalcogenide materials have been proposed as possible candidates for solar cell applications. In this work, we provide accurate theoretical calculations for BaZrS 3 and two phases of SrZrS 3, which have been recently synthesized and their optical properties elaborated. In this study, we consider the substitution of S in BaZrS 3 with Se to form BaZrSe 3. Evolutionary methods are used to find the optimal structure of this compound, and accurate calculations of its optoelectronic properties are presented. Using phonon frequency calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics, we assess the stability of this compound. We find that BaZrSe 3 is likely to be stable under typical conditions, with a low bandgap and high optical absorption coefficients. This suggests that BaZrSe 3 could be useful for solar cell applications.

As a promising semiconductor material, two-dimensional (2D) organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites possess outstanding optical and electrical properties and have attracted significant interest for their wide energy applications. Therefore, a basic mechanical property study of 2D perovskite material will both improve the understanding of atomic layer-dependent property change and guide next-generation novel device designs. Here, we report a direct shear modulus characterization of 2D organic-inorganic hybrid (C4H9NH3)(2)PbBr4 perovskites in the < 001 > direction by atomic force microscopy. The measured shear modulus of the 2D perovskite increases significantly with the decrease of the atomic layers, especially as the layer number is less than 60. A composite sandwich model to the free surface contractions of the molecular interaction length is built to reveal this abnormal atomic layer-dependent mechanical phenomenon. The characterization method and the sandwich model with a rigid-elastic atomic interaction can be extended to analyze other 2D materials.

By investigating the use of the porphyrin-based YD2-o-C8 and YDD6, and the organic chromophore TTAR, which can act as complementary absorbers, we are able to enhance the capture of incoming light across the solar spectrum. This is demonstrated first by using a conventional DSSC architecture with a liquid electrolyte and performed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.2%, representing an improvement over cells based on each of the independent dyes. Next, we used Cs2SnI6 as an encapsulating layer over the sensitizing molecules to reduce charge leakage across the dye layers and also added to the absorption of longer wavelengths up to one micron. Finally, we fabricated a cell utilizing a Cs2SnI6/succinonitrile solid hole-transport electrolyte and achieved a PCE of similar to 8.5%. It is expected that the all solid-state design will go a long way toward improving long-term device stability.	[Lee, Byunghong; Lee, Woongkyu; Marks, Tobin J.; Chang, Robert P.

We fabricate and characterize 75 unique perovskite-inspired compositions within a 2-month period, with 87% exhibiting band gaps between 1.2 and 2.4 eV, which are of interest for energy-harvesting applications. We utilize a fully connected deep neural network to classify compounds based on experimental X-ray diffraction data into 0D, 2D, and 3D structures, more than 10 times faster than human analysis and with 90% accuracy. We validate our methods using lead-halide perovskites and extend the application to lead-free compositions. The wider synthesis window and faster cycle of learning enables the realization of a multi-site lead-free alloy series, Cs-3(Bi1-xSbx)(2)(I1-xBrx)(9). We reveal the non-linear band-gap behavior and transition in dimensionality upon simultaneous alloying on the B-site and X-site of Cs3Bi2I9 with Sb and Br.	[Sun, Shijing; Hartono, Noor T.

Here, we report an approach to sequentially apply a typical one-step solution formulation-self-seeding growth (SSG)-to realize highquality perovskite thin films with reduced defect density, fewer apparent grain boundaries, improved charge-carrier transport and lifetime, and enhanced hydrophobicity for enhanced stability. Using FA-MA-Cs-based perovskite, SSG devices showed improved efficiency from 17.76% (control) to 20.30% (SSG), with an unencapsulated device retaining > 80% of its initial efficiency over 4,680-h storage in an ambient environment with high relative humidities. The SSG devices also exhibited much improved thermal and operational stabilities. In addition, SSG can be applied to different substrates and perovskite compositions, which makes it a viable method for preparing high-quality perovskite thin films for device applications.

Here we show that 1,3,7-trimethylxanthine, a commodity chemical with two conjugated carboxyl groups better known by its common name caffeine, improves the performance and thermal stability of perovskite solar cells based on both MAPbI(3) and CsFAMAPbI(3) active layers. The strong interaction between caffeine and Pb2+ ions serves as a "molecular lock'' that increases the activation energy during film crystallization, delivering a perovskite film with preferred orientation, improved electronic properties, reduced ion migration, and greatly enhanced thermal stability. Planar n-i-p solar cells based on caffeine-incorporated pure MAPbI(3) perovskites, which are notoriously unstable, exhibit a champion-stabilized efficiency of 19.8% and retain over 85% of their efficiency under continuous annealing at 85 degrees C in nitrogen.

We investigated the effect of spectral power distributions on the color quality of white light to provide guidelines for designing white LED devices. The white light was obtained by combining appropriate ratios of blue, green, yellow, and red light emitted from hybrid halide perovskites [MAPb(BrxI1-x)(3)]. The color characteristics of white light were evaluated by calculating CIE 1931 chromaticity coordinates, correlated color temperature (CCT), general color rendering index (R-a), special color rendering indices (R-9-R-15), D-uv, and luminous efficacy of radiation (LER). The high tunability of CCT from 2298 K (warm white) to 8270 K (cool white) with CRI up to 95.4 has been achieved by tuning the ratios of integrated areas of different emissions with extremely small D-uv (0.00002-0.0043) indicating the neutral appearance (not greenish or pinkish) of the obtained white light. High LER above 300 lm/W demonstrates that the high vision performance of white LEDs based on perovskite materials. This work provides strong motivation and guidelines for further developing this type of materials for white LEDs with the goal of realizing widespread adoption of white LEDs in general illumination market.

In this work, we have introduced silicon oxide as an interfacial modifier of the electron transporting layer in TiO2-based planar heterojunction PSCs. The incorporation of a silicon oxide modifier passivates the trap states of perovskite absorber and suppresses the charge recombination of PSCs. As a consequence, a competitive solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency of 18.0 % was achieved for the device fabricated with the silicon-oxide-modified TiO2 electron extraction layer, which is increased by 15 % compared with the PSC fabricated with pristine TiO2; this can be attributed to the significantly increased open-circuit voltage and photocurrent density. Furthermore, the ultraviolet light irradiation stability of PSCs is greatly improved, resulting from the low photocatalytic activity of the silicon-oxide-modified TiO2 electron transporting layer, as revealed by the photoelectrochemical oxidation of CH3NH2. This work represents a feasible step through interfacial engineering toward the realization of ultraviolet-light-stable and scalable PSCs.

Our joint experimental and theoretical study demonstrates that BaCoF4, a prototype in this new class, possesses a unique combination of multiferroic and photovoltaic properties. Moreover, BaCoF4 exhibits both an antiferromagnetic spin structure and ferroelectric polarization along the (001) direction. These combined electronic and optical features render BaCoF4 a promising bifunctional material for application in spintronic or photovoltaic devices. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the dominant point defects in BaCoF4 are mostly shallow-level donor defects, leading to fascinating n-type self-doping. As such, a BaCoF4 layer may be exploited for electron transport and light absorption altogether, which may enhance the photovoltaic performance in solar cells. To confirm this predicted feature, we incorporate BaCoF4 as an electron transport layer and fabricated a BaCoF4/Cs(0.05)MA(0.14)FA(0.81)PbI(2.55)Br(0.45) -based solar cell device. Notably, the solar cell devices yield the champion power conversion efficiency of ca. 13.14%. We also investigate photovoltaic properties of other analogous materials and find that BaNiBr4 and BaMnCl4 also possess both multiferroic and photovoltaic bifunctionalities. Hence, this new class of BaMX4 offers diverse and tunable capability for various applications.

Bimodal Bandgaps in Mixed Cesium Methylammonium Lead Bromide Perovskite Single Crystals	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							HALIDE PEROVSKITES; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; SOLAR-CELLS; CATIONS; CRYSTALLIZATION; STABILIZATION; ABSORBER	Alloying inorganic cations such as Cs+ or Rb+ into hybrid lead halide perovskites has been shown to provide long-term material stability critical to the implementation in solar cells, but little is known about how cation alloying affects the electronic properties. Here we study single crystals of mixed-cation lead bromide perovskite, Cs-x(CH3NH3)(1-x) PbBr3, in a range of cation mixing ratios, x = 0.05-0.3. In contrast to the continuous bandgap tunability known for mixed-anion alloys, we find that the bandgaps of Cs-x(CH3NH3)(1-x) PbBr3 single crystals adopt a bimodal distribution, with bandgaps similar to those of pure CH3NH3PbBr3 for x <= 0.13 and pure CsPbBr 3 for x > 0.13. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction reveals a structural origin of this abrupt change in bandgap: with increasing Cs concentration, there is a similar to 3% lattice shrinkage and appearance of twin splitting at x >= 0.13. These findings are manifestations of the structural complexity and phase instability of lead halide perovskites.

Phase-Pure Hybrid Layered Lead Iodide Perovskite Films Based on a Two-Step Melt-Processing Approach	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							LIGHT-EMITTING-DIODES; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; SOLAR-CELLS; THIN-FILMS; PERFORMANCE; PRECURSOR; CRYSTALLIZATION; RECOMBINATION; TIN	Layered lead halide perovskites have recently been heavily investigated due to their versatile structures, tunable electronic properties, and better stability compared with 3D perovskites and have also been effectively incorporated into photovoltaic and light-emitting devices. They are often prepared into thin film form by solution methods and typically contain a mixture of phases with different inorganic layer thicknesses (denoted by "n"). In addition, melt-processing has recently been introduced as an option for film deposition of n = 1 lead iodide-based perovskites. Here, we study the thermal properties of higher n (n > 1) layered perovskites in the family (beta-Me-PEA)(2)MA(n-1)Pb(n)I(3n+1), with n = 1, 2, and 3 and where beta-Me-PEA = beta-methylphenethylammonium and MA = methylammonium, and reveal that they do not melt congruently. However, they can still be melt-processed in air by using a two-step process that includes a lower temperature post-annealing step after the initial brief melting step. While typically higher n films contain a mixture of the different n phases, the resulting two-step melt-processed films are highly crystalline and phase pure. Optical and electrical properties of these films were further characterized by time-resolved photoluminescence and dark/illuminated transport measurements, showing the same order of magnitude single-exciton recombination rates compared to previous single crystal results and >2 orders of magnitude higher conductivity compared to conventional spin-coated films. These results offer new pathways to study the layered perovskites and to integrate them into electronic and optoelectronic devices.

In order to accomplish both goals, semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes are added to perovskite films as additives, functioning as both the crystal growth templates and charge bridges between the perovskite grains. The resulting perovskite films display more uniform and larger crystal grains compared with conventional films owing to the long and flexible single-walled carbon nanotubes, retarding the crystal growth and functioning as the cross-linker between perovskite grains. In addition, sodium deoxycholates attached on the carbon nanotubes passivated the grain boundaries by forming Lewis adducts. Thanks to the improved quality of the photoactive layers by using semiconducting carbon nanotubes, a power conversion efficiency of 19.5% was obtained which is higher than 18.1% of reference devices with no additives.

However, charge transport in such optoelectronics is intrinsically directional due to the existence of p-n junctions, which thus lacks the potential to elucidate any perturbations in light or electricity during energy conversion. Here, with the presence of a LiCl additive in a formamidinium chloride (FACl) solution, the as-grown LiCl: FAPbCl(3) nanorods demonstrate greatly enhanced crystallinity and UV photoresponse as compared to pristine FAPbCl(3) nanostructures without the LiCl additive. Most importantly, the LiCl: FAPbCl(3) nanorod film exhibits unprecedented distinguishability to UV photons with different energies and oscillating intensities, in the form of bipolar and periodically oscillatory photocurrents. This work could advance the fundamental understanding of photoinduced carrier processes in halide perovskites and facilitate the development of novel UV-based optical communications.

Melting Transitions of the Organic Subphase in Layered Two-Dimensional Halide Perovskites	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article							BROAD-BAND EMISSION; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; SOLAR-CELLS; INORGANIC PEROVSKITES; HYBRID PEROVSKITES; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; EFFICIENT; MONOLAYERS; (CNH2N+1NH3)(2)PBI4; ENERGY	We investigate the phase behavior of two-dimensional (CxH2x+1NH3)(2)[(MA,FA)PbI3](n-1)PbI4 layered perovskites near room temperature (-20 degrees C to +100 degrees C) as a function of the octahedral layer thickness (n = 1, 2, 3, 4), alkylammonium chain length (butyl, pentyl, and hexyl), and identity of the small organic cation (methylammonium and formamidinium). Using differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction, we observe a reversible first-order phase transition corresponding to a partial melting transition of the alkylammonium chains separating the perovskite layers. The melting temperature, T-m, increases from 10 to 77.9 to 95.9 degrees C as the carbon chain length increases from C-4 to C-5 to C-6, but it is insensitive to octahedral layer thickness, n. The latent heat of melting, Delta H-m, was in the range of 3-5 kJ/mol-spacer, indicating only partial disordering of the carbon chain. We discuss these findings and their implications in the context of melting in other two-dimensional molecular systems.

Solution-Processed Bismuth Halide Perovskite Thin Films: Influence of Deposition Conditions and A-Site Alloying on Morphology and Optical Properties	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article							LEAD-FREE; SOLAR-CELLS; ACTIVE-LAYER; IODIDE; EFFICIENCY; PERFORMANCE; ABSORPTION; TRIHALIDE; ABSORBER; SPECTRUM	Bismuth-based halide perovskites have been proposed as a potential nontoxic alternative to lead halide perovskites; however, they have not realized suitable performance. Their poor performance has been attributed to substandard film morphologies and too wide of a band gap for many applications. Herein we used a two-step deposition procedure to convert BiI3 thin films into A(3)Bi(2)I(9) (A = FA(+), MAP, Cs+, or Rb+), which resulted in a substantial improvement in film morphology, a larger band gap, and greater compositional tunability compared toresults when using aconventional single-step deposition technique. Additionally, we attempted to reduce the undesirably wide band gap in Rb3Bi2I9 thin films by inducing chemical pressures through cation-size mismatch, with an underlying hypothesis that cation-size mismatch could induce compressive strain within the 2D Rb3Bi2I9 lattice. However, we found that all A(x)Rb(3-x)Bi(2)I(9) compositions with x > 0 adopted the 0D structure, and no changes to the band gap were observed with alloy. These results imply that the band gap of A(x)Rb(3-x)Bi(2)I(9) is insensitive to A-site alloying.

Lattice anchoring stabilizes solution-processed semiconductors	NATURE			English	Article							PEROVSKITE; PHOTOLUMINESCENCE; THICKNESS	The stability of solution-processed semiconductors remains an important area for improvement on their path to wider deployment. Inorganic caesium lead halide perovskites have a bandgap well suited to tandem solar cells(1) but suffer from an undesired phase transition near room temperature(2). Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are structurally robust materials prized for their size-tunable bandgap(3); however, they also require further advances in stability because they are prone to aggregation and surface oxidization at high temperatures as a consequence of incomplete surface passivation(4,5). Here we report 'lattice-anchored' hybrid materials that combine caesium lead halide perovskites with lead chalcogenide CQDs, in which lattice matching between the two materials contributes to a stability exceeding that of the constituents. We find that CQDs keep the perovskite in its desired cubic phase, suppressing the transition to the undesired lattice-mismatched phases. The stability of the CQD-anchored perovskite in air is enhanced by an order of magnitude compared with pristine perovskite, and the material remains stable for more than six months at ambient conditions (25 degrees Celsius and about 30 per cent humidity) and more than five hours at 200 degrees Celsius. The perovskite prevents oxidation of the CQD surfaces and reduces the agglomeration of the nanoparticles at 100 degrees Celsius by a factor of five compared with CQD controls. The matrix-protected CQDs show a photoluminescence quantum efficiency of 30 per cent for a CQD solid emitting at infrared wavelengths. The lattice-anchored CQD: perovskite solid exhibits a doubling in charge carrier mobility as a result of a reduced energy barrier for carrier hopping compared with the pure CQD solid. These benefits have potential uses in solution-processed optoelectronic devices.

Yet, there exists challenges on the way to the practical use of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), such as light stability and current-voltage (J-V) hysteresis. Inorganic perovskite nanocrystals (IPNCs) are promising candidates for high-performance photovoltaic devices due to their simple synthesis methods, tunable bandgap, and efficient photon downshifting effect for ultraviolet (UV) light blocking and conversion. In this work, CsPbBr3 IPNCs modification could give rise to the vapor phase and solution-processed PSCs with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.4% and 20.8%, respectively, increased by 11.6% and 5.6% compared to the control devices for more efficient UV utilization and carrier recombination suppression. As far as is known, 11.6% is the most effective enhanced factor for PSCs based on photon downshifting effect inside of devices. The CsPbBr3 layer could also significantly retard light-induced degradation, leading to the lifetime over 100 h under UV illumination for PSCs. Additionally, the modified PSCs exhibit weak hysteresis and multiple colors of fluorescence. These results shed light on the future design of combining a photon downshifting layer and carrier interfacial modification layer in the applications of perovskite optoelectronic devices.

Phosphorus-Rich Colloidal Cobalt Diphosphide (CoP2) Nanocrystals for Electrochemical and Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen Evolution	ADVANCED MATERIALS			English	Article						cobalt diphosphide; density functional theory; in situ XAS; metal-insulator-semiconductor; photoelectrochemical water splitting	PEROVSKITE SOLAR-CELLS; PHOSPHIDE NANOPARTICLES; NICKEL PHOSPHIDE; SILICON; ELECTROCATALYST; STABILITY; PERFORMANCE; GENERATION; CATALYST; TRENDS	Developing earth-abundant and efficient electrocatalysts for photoelectrochemical water splitting is critical to realizing a high-performance solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion process. Herein, phosphorus-rich colloidal cobalt diphosphide nanocrystals (CoP2 NCs) are synthesized via hot injection. The CoP2 NCs show a Pt-like hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalytic activity in acidic solution with a small overpotential of 39 mV to achieve -10 mA cm(-2) and a very low Tafel slope of 32 mV dec(-1). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the high P content both physically separates Co atoms to prevent H from over binding to multiple Co atoms, while simultaneously stabilizing H adsorbed to single Co atoms. The catalytic performance of the CoP2 NCs is further demonstrated in a metal-insulator-semiconductor photoelectrochemical device consisting of bottom p-Si light absorber, atomic layer deposition Al-ZnO passivation layers, and the CoP2 cocatalyst. The p-Si/AZO/TiO2/CoP2 photocathode shows a photocurrent density of -16.7 mA cm(-2) at 0 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and an output photovoltage of 0.54 V. The high performance and stability are attributed to the junction between p-Si and AZO, the corrosion-resistance of the pinhole-free TiO2 protective layer, and the fast HER kinetics of the CoP2 NCs.

The power conversion efficiency of the record lab-scale cell is 23.3%, which is higher than record lab-scale cells for commercially dominant multi-crystalline silicon and CdTe solar cells. Owing to their high open-circuit voltage, sharp absorption edge, tunable bandgap and solution processibility, perovskite solar cells are ideal candidates for incorporation in tandem solar cells, which in practice can exceed even the theoretical limits for a single junction cell. In this review, following the theoretical efficiency limits of single and tandem solar cells, we review the development of single-junction perovskite solar cells with a focus on the material structure, bandgap engineering and crystallization strategies. We then focus on the key challenges in perovskite-based tandem solar cells, showing the recent advances in high-efficiency organic-perovskite, inorganic-perovskite, and perovskite-perovskite tandem cells. Finally, we map out research directions to further develop perovskite-based tandem solar cells. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the optoelectronic properties of 2D perovskites need to be optimized in order to achieve high efficiency. In this work, the effect of spacer cations, i.e., phenethylammonium (PEA), 4-fluorophenethylammonium (F-PEA), and 4-methoxyphenethylammonium (MeO-PEA) on the optoelectronic properties and device performance of quasi-2D perovskites is systematically studied. It is observed that both larger and more hydrophobic cations can improve perovskite stability against moisture, while larger size can adversely influence the device performance. Interestingly, with F-PEA or MeO-PEA, distribution of n value can be shifted toward high 3D content in quasi-2D perovskite layers, which enables lower bandgaps and possibly lower exciton binding energy. Due to the best charge transport and lowest bandgap, the F-PEAI-based quasi-2D perovskite (n = 5) solar cell shows a highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.5% with excellent stability in air with a humidity of 40-50%, keeping 90% of the original PCE after 40 d. It is believed that the approach may open a way for the design of new organic spacer cations for stable low-dimensional hybrid perovskites with high performance.

Coronene, perylene, pyrene, and [4]helicene, which are fragments of graphene, can be contorted using facile synthetic chemistry into large nanoribbons and nano-architectures. In comparing contorted or higher-dimensional graphene architectures to planar or lower-dimensional species, the materials properties are reliably enhanced for the contorted aromatics. Examples of enhanced properties include optical absorptivity, conductivity, device photoconversion efficiency, and solubility. These enhancements are exemplified in organic photovoltaics, photodetectors, field effect transistors, and perovskite solar cells. Described herein are key advances in dimensional control of contorted aromatics that have resulted in world record photoconversion efficiencies, photodetection capabilities matching inorganic state-of-the-art devices, and similar to 5 nm long ultrathin soluble graphene nanoribbons.

Finding novel strategies such as device structure engineering is a key pathway toward addressing this issue. In this work, the light absorption and carrier collection of OPV devices are improved by employment of ZnO nanowire (NW) arrays with an optimum NW length (50 nm) and antireflection (AR) film with nanocone structure. The optical characterization results show that ZnO NW increases the transmittance of the electron transporting layer as well as the absorption of the polymer blend. Moreover, the as-deposited polymer blend on the ZnO NW array shows better charge transfer as compared to the planar sample. By employing PC70BM:PV2000 as a promising air-stable active-layer, power conversion efficiencies of 9.8% and 10.1% are achieved for NW devices without and with an AR film, indicating 22.5% and 26.2% enhancement in PCE as compared to that of planar device. Moreover, it is shown that the AR film enhances the water-repellent ability of the OPV device.

The results are extremely promising in that they showcase comparable cell efficiencies, with the Sn-based device showing a highest 21.3% efficiency (Jsc of 332.8 A/m(2), Voc of 0.839 V, FF of 0.764) compared to 23.4% of its Pb counterpart (Jsc of 349.3 A/m(2), Voc of 0.811 V, FF of 0.828), at similar active layer thicknesses. A deeper study of each of the Jsc, Voc and FF trends provide keen insight into charge transfer kinetics within the device, paving the way to optimal experimental setups for fabricating the most efficient non-toxic perovskite devices.

Single-Source Vapor Deposition of Quantum-Cutting Yb3+:CsPb(Cl1-xBrx)(3) and Other Complex Metal-Halide Perovskites	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						single-source vapor deposition; metal-halide perovskite; quantum cutting; mechanochemistry; scalable processing; solar	TANDEM SOLAR-CELLS; EFFICIENCY; IODIDE; CATIONS	Metal-halide semiconductors exhibit attractive properties for a host of applications including photovoltaics, solid-state lighting, and photodetection. Among the remarkable recent developments is the discovery of extraordinarily high photoluminescence quantum yields in Yb3+-doped inorganic lead-halide perovskites. Although all previous research and development of such quantum-cutting materials has involved solution-phase preparation, particularly as colloidal nanocrystals, such methods can introduce both processing and technical challenges that limit the scope of accessible compositions, morphologies, and scaled-up applications. Here, we demonstrate a scalable single-source vapor deposition (SSVD) method for depositing high quality conformal thin films of complex metal-halide perovskites, including doped perovskites, over large areas at high deposition rates. Focusing on quantum-cutting Yb3+:CsPb(Cl1-xBrx)(3), we demonstrate large-area deposition of films with photoluminescence quantum yields as high as 183%, starting from single-source powders prepared mechanochemically from solid ionic precursors. We also prepare thin films of the solar absorber material (FA(0.81)MA(0.14)Cs(0.05))Pb(Cl0.02Br0.14I0.84)(3) to illustrate the generality of this SSVD method. These results demonstrate a promising approach to high-throughput vapor processing of metal-halide coatings for photonic and optoelectronic applications.

In this study, high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) methods are used to computationally model and screen 1845 halide perovskites in search of new materials without these limitations that are promising for solar cell applications. This study focuses on finding materials that are comprised of nontoxic elements, stable in a humid operating environment, and have an optimal bandgap for one of single junction, tandem Si-perovskite, or quantum dot-based solar cells. Single junction materials are also screened on predicted single junction photovoltaic (PV) efficiencies exceeding 22.7%, which is the current highest reported PV efficiency for halide perovskites. Generally, these methods qualitatively reproduce the properties of known promising nontoxic halide perovskites that are either experimentally evaluated or predicted from theory. From a set of 1845 materials, 15 materials pass all screening criteria for single junction cell applications, 13 of which are not previously investigated, such as (CH3NH3)(0.75)Cs0.25SnI3, ((NH2)(2)CH)Ag0.5Sb0.5Br3, CsMn0.875Fe0.125I3, ((CH3)(2)NH2)Ag0.5Bi0.5I3, and ((NH2)(2)CH)(0.5)Rb0.5SnI3. These materials, together with others predicted in this study, may be promising candidate materials for stable, highly efficient, and nontoxic perovskite-based solar cells.

Here, we report a facile strategy of wrapping perovskite grains within an oligomeric silica (OS) matrix in a core-shell geometry, which can synchronously passivate the defects at surfaces and grain boundaries and stabilize the grains at the nanoscale. We observe a significant reduction of trap density and elongation of carrier lifetime in OS-wrapped perovskites, which yields an increased efficiency of 21.5% for p-i-n structured PSCs with a decent open-circuit voltage of 1.15 V and a fill factor of 0.81. This all-around nanoscale grain wrapping leads to remarkable improvement of the operational stability of PSCs, sustaining 80% of the efficiency after "burn-in" under full sunlight with UV for more than 5200 h. Our findings provide a new pathway towards efficient and stable PSCs.

However, the fabrication of such nanomaterials on polymer-based flexible electrodes is particularly challenging due to degradation of the flexible electrodes at a high temperature. Here we report the fabrication of nickel oxide nanopillar arrays (NiOx NaPAs) on a flexible electrode by vapor deposition, which enables highly efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The NiOx NaPAs exhibit an enhanced light transmittance for light harvesting, prohibit exciton recombination, promote irradiation-generated hole transport and collection, and facilitate the formation of large perovskite grains. These advantageous features result in a high efficiency of 20% and 17% for the rigid and flexible PSCs, respectively. Additionally, the NaPAs show no cracking after 500 times of bending, consistent with the mechanic simulation results. This robust fabrication opens a new opportunity for the fabrication of a large area of high-performance flexible optoelectronic devices.

Herein, fully-printed, flexible cesium (Cs)-doped triple cation perovskite photodetector with good reliability and stability is achieved via a combination of roll-to-roll (R2R) micro-gravure printing, R2R slot-die coating and blade-coating, in which high-quality perovskite film is fabricated by two-step solution process on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) under ambient condition. As a result, the photodetector exhibits a broad photoresponse region from ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (NIR), a high responsivity (R) value of 1.62 AW(-1), an excellent I-light/I-dark ratio as high as 1.83 x 10(4) and a good detectivity (D*) value up to 7.77 x 10(12) Jones. Moreover, it shows excellent electrical stability and mechanical flexibility as bended with various curvatures for 2000 cycles, and the R values of photodetector array on a large-area film show a very narrow distribution, resulting from the homogeneous and compact perovskite film. More importantly, 80% of initial performance can be maintained even exposed to ambient condition (humidity similar to 45%, temperature similar to 30 degrees C) for 700h without encapsulation, which is attributed to the stability of perovskite material and perovskite/electrodes interface, as well as the passivation of slightly excess PbI2 in perovskite film. The results show that fully-printed, flexible perovskite photodetector with good scalability and stability can be achieved via R2R printing technique, which provides an alternative strategy for perovskite application in low-cost optoelectronic devices.

In this work, CsPbBr3 perovskite nanowires are employed for modifying the surface electronic states of bulk perovskite thin films, forming compositionally-graded heterojunction at the perovskite/HTL interface of PSCs. The nanowire morphology is found to be key to achieving lateral homogeneity in the perovskite film surface states resulting in a near-ideal graded heterojunction. The hidden role of such lateral homogeneity on the performance of graded-heterojunction PSCs is revealed for the first time. The resulting PSCs show high PCE up to 21.4%, as well as high operational stability, which is superior to control PSCs fabricated without CsPbBr3-nanocrystals modification and with CsPbBr3-nanocubes modification. This study demonstrates the promise of controlled hybridization of perovskite nanowires and bulk thin films for more efficient and stable PSCs.

Atomic layer deposition of vanadium oxide to reduce parasitic absorption and improve stability in n-i-p perovskite solar cells for tandems	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS			English	Article							ORGANIC HOLE-TRANSPORTERS; THIN-FILMS; INDUCED DEGRADATION; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; EXTRACTION LAYER; OXIDATION-STATES; EFFICIENT; ELECTRODE; INTERFACES; CONTACTS	Two critical issues associated with semi-transparent, n-i-p perovskite solar cells for 2-terminal tandem devices are parasitic absorption and long-term instability associated with the widely used spiro-OMeTAD and MoOx hole transport and buffer layers, respectively. In this work, we present an alternative hole contact bilayer that consists of a 30 nm undoped layer of spiro-TTB in conjunction with 9 nm of air-stable vanadium oxide (VOx) deposited via atomic layer deposition. The low absorption of UV and visible light in this bilayer results in the fabrication of a semi-transparent perovskite cell with 18.9 mA cm(-2) of photocurrent, a 14% increase compared to the 16.6 mA cm(-2) generated in a control device with 150 nm of doped spiro-OMeTAD. The ALD VOx buffer layer shows promise as a stable alternative to MoOx; an unencapsulated Cs(0.17)FA(0.83)Pb(Br0.17I0.83)(3) device with ALD VOx and ITO as the top contact maintains its efficiency following 1000 hours at 85 degrees C in a N-2 environment. Lastly, we use transfer matrix modeling of the optimized perovskite stack to predict its optical performance in a monolithic tandem cell with heterojunction silicon.

Transferring state of art high efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs) processing onto a flexible substrate, however, is challenging, requiring substantial redevelopment of materials compositions, device architectures, and processing conditions. In this work, highly flexible, robust, stable, and high efficiency PSCs based on mica substrate have been successfully developed, exhibiting a champion photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.0%, retaining more than 91.7% of the original PCE after 5000 cycles of large deformation bending, and being relatively stable against humidity under elevated temperature. Key to such excellent performance is the inorganic and transparent mica substrate that is chemically inert and stable under high temperature, so that processing developed for glass-based high efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs) can be readily applied without modification. Furthermore, the layered mica substrate is highly flexible, and van der Waals epitaxial growth of transparent conducing ITO relaxes the mechanical constraint on the PSCs substantially, reducing the strain in the device even under large bending deformation. We believe inorganic flexible mica substrate can be used as a platform for high efficiency PSCs compatible to glass substrate, speeding up the development of flexible PSCs substantially.

In this work, we use theoretical calculations to identify that polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which is chemically stable and inexpensive, can be a highly efficient thermal emitter for cooling flexible thin-film solar cells. It is shown that a 200 mu m-thick planar PDMS layer is capable of achieving high emissivity over 0.9 in the whole IR regime of 4-26 mu m. The emissivity can be further increased to near-unity by introducing pyramid structures to the surface in the range of 8-13 mu m, where environment radiation is negligible. According to the calculated radiative cooling rates and realistic power conversion efficiencies, we show that a pyramid-structured PDMS layer can significantly lower the temperature of an organic, a perovskite and a micro-crystalline (mu c)-Si flexible solar cell by 11 degrees C, 12 C and 16 degrees C, respectively. This work may provide important guidance to the design of high performance and reliable flexible solar cells.

Devices were pressed from chemically synthesized powders. Pressed perovskite powders were found to exhibit properties favorable for use in supercapacitors. Furthermore, physical properties of the pellets are controllable through the sintering process, allowing for broad device tunability. It is demonstrated that the electrical performance of characterized 1 mm pellets are temperature, frequency, and cell potential difference dependent. The device under study exhibited an energy density of 34.2 Wh/kg at 100 Hz at room temperature. The high performance of the device is attributed to perovskite's ability to operate at potential differences of up to 10V. A mean areal capacitance of 432 mF/cm(2) was recorded for a broad range of frequencies at 300K. A significant drop in performance is observed at operating frequencies above 10(5) Hz. This is caused by the operating frequency exceeding the lead-iodide stretching mode. Work herein demonstrates that perovskite materials are suitable for use as energy storage devices in applications demanding wide ranging thermal and electrical properties. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

XRD Rietveld refinement analysis is performed to obtain the structural information of the synthesized materials. The results indicate the Al3+ and Gd3+ sites are substituted by the Mn4+ and Yb3+ ions, respectively. Intense NIR emission within the most sensitive response region of c-Si solar cells is observed under UV-visible excitation, indicating the existence of efficient energy transfer from Mn4+ to Yb3+ ions. The dipole-dipole interaction is verified to be the dominant energy transfer mechanism among the Mn4+-Yb3+ pair. The linear dependence of energy transfer rate on the Yb3+ concentration indicates that one NIR photon is generated with the absorption of one UV-visible photon. The broad excitation spanning from 250 to 600 nm monitored at NIR emission demonstrates that the Mn4+ ions in the CaGdAlO4 host can be efficient sensitizers for Yb3+ ions to enhance the performance of c-Si cells.

In this work, a three-dimensional (3D) perovskite solar cell is demonstrated using functionalized carbon nanotube (CNT) yarn as both the cathode and anode material. TiO2 and 2,2,7,-7-tetrakis(N, N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9'-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) are used as the electron transporting and hole transporting material respectively. The TiO2 oxide layer is deposited on the top of the twisted carbon nanotube yarn and annealed with TiCl4 to generate the uniform electron transport layer. A dip coating process is employed to produce a uniform perovskite layer on top of the TiO2 oxide layer. Platinized carbon nanotube yarn is wrapped around on the top of the hole transporting layer and serves as the counter electrode. The photovoltaic characterization of the prepared cells was carried out at different cell lengths. Under AM 1.5 (100 mW cm(-2)) illumination it shows an enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) with a high open current voltage (V-OC) of 0.825 V. This three-dimensional all solid-state perovskite solar cell shows a promising prospect in portable and wearable textile electronics.

We investigated the effects of the layer thickness of mp-TiO2 and particle size of TiO2 on photovoltaic properties, in terms of the surface area of the mp-layer and the interfacial areas of the TiO2 nanoparticles in the mp-layer. Various mp-TiO2 layers with thicknesses of 150, 250, and 400 nm and particle sizes of 25 nm and 41 nm were prepared to compare the photovoltaic properties of such layer-containing perovskite solar cells. Time-resolved photoluminescence decay and impedance studies showed that interfacial resistance as well as perovskite-to-TiO2 charge injection are important factors affecting photovoltaic performance. The deterioration of the photovoltaic parameters with increasing TiO2/TiO2 interfacial area also confirms that the interfacial series resistance that arises from these connections should be reduced to enhance the performance of mesoscopic perovskite solar cells.

Ethylenediammonium-Based "Hollow" Pb/Sn Perovskites with Ideal Band Gap Yield Solar Cells with Higher Efficiency and Stability	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							HALIDE PEROVSKITES; SMALL MOLECULES; LEAD; EVOLUTION; CATIONS; LAYER; TIN; CURRENTS	The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of halide perovskite solar cells is now comparable to that of commercial solar cells. These solar cells are generally based on multication mixed-halide perovskite absorbers with nonideal band gaps of 1.5-1.6 eV. The PCE should be able to rise further if the solar cells could use narrower-band gap absorbers (1.2-1.4 eV). Reducing the Pb content of the semiconductors without sacrificing performance is also a significant driver in the perovskite solar cell research. Here, we demonstrate that mixed Pb/Sn-based perovskites containing the oversized ethylenediammonium (en) dication, {en}-FA(0.5)MA(0.5)Sn(0.5)Pb(0.5)I(3) (FA = formamidinium, MA = methylammonium), can exhibit ideal band gaps of 1.27-1.38 eV, suitable for the assembly of single-junction solar cells with higher efficiencies. The use of en dication creates a three-dimensional (3D) hollow inorganic perovskite structure, which was verified through crystal density measurements and single-crystal X-ray diffraction structural analysis as well as nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. The {en}FA(0.5)MA(0.5)Sn(0.5)Pb(0.5)I(3) structure has massive Pb/Sn vacancies and much higher chemical stability than the same structure without en and vacancies. This new property reduces the dark current and carrier trap density and increases the carrier lifetime of the Pb/Sn-based perovskite films. Therefore, solar cells using {en}-FA(0.5)MA(0.5)Sn(0.5)Pb(0.5)I(3) light absorbers have substantially enhanced air stability and around 20% improvement in efficiency. After overlaying a thin MABr top layer, we found that the {5% en}FA(0.5)MA(0.5)Sn(0.5)Pb(0.5)I(3) material gives an optimized PCE of 17.04%. The results highlight the strong promise of 3D hollow mixed Pb/Sn perovskites in achieving ideal band gap materials with higher chemical stability and lower Pb content for high-performance single-junction solar cells or multijunction solar cells serving as bottom cells.

The details of the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the tetragonal phase of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite existing at room temperature are often overlooked, with unresolved (002) (at 2 = 13.99 degrees for CuK and q = 0.9927 angstrom(-1)) and (110) (at 2 = 14.14 degrees and q = 1.003 angstrom(-1)) peaks considered to be one peak at 14 degrees, leading to an inaccurate estimation of lattice parameters. In this study, we use an electrospray deposition technique to prepare perovskite films at room temperature, oriented in (002) and (110) directions, with (002) as the preferred orientation. The results of a detailed study on the emergence of the two orientations during perovskite formation are reported. The effect of process parameters, such as substrate temperature during deposition and annealing temperature, on the grain orientation was established using XRD and grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). The study suggests that an irreversible crystal reorientation from (002) to (110) occurs at high temperature during rapid annealing, whereas a reversible crystal thermal expansion is seen during slow annealing. Finally, the results of the grain reorientation are correlated with the film properties, and it is shown that the film with the dominant (110) orientation has improved morphology and optoelectronic properties. The detailed structural investigation and characterization presented in this study are important for the precise determination of crystal orientation and achievement of desirable photovoltaic properties of the absorber material by carefully observing the adjacent crystal plane peaks in the XRD pattern of the perovskite thin films.

Comprehensive Computational Study of Partial Lead Substitution in Methylammonium Lead Bromide	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							PEROVSKITE SOLAR-CELLS; METAL HALIDE PEROVSKITE; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; PHOTOVOLTAIC PROPERTIES; EFFICIENCY; FORMAMIDINIUM; CH3NH3PBI3; BANDGAP	Impurities in semiconductors, for example, lead-based hybrid perovskites, have a major influence on their performance as photovoltaic (PV) light absorbers. While impurities could create harmful trap states that lead to nonradiative recombination of charge carriers and adversely affect PV efficiency, they could also potentially increase absorption via midgap energy levels that act as stepping stones for subgap photons or introduce charge carriers via doping. To unearth trends in impurity energy states, we use first principles density functional theory calculations to extensively study partial substitution of Pb in methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr(3)), a representative lead-halide perovskite. Investigation of the density of states and energy levels related to the transition of the substitutional defect from one charge state to another reveals that several elements create midgap energy states in MAPbBr(3). We machine learned trends and design rules from the computational data and discovered that a few easily computed properties of the bromide compounds of any element can be used to predict the energetics and energy levels of the substitutional defect related to that element. The calculated Fermi level-dependent defect formation energies lead to the observation that substitution by transition metals, Zr, Hf, Nb, and Sc, and group V element Sb can shift the equilibrium Fermi level and change the perovskite conductivity, as determined by the dominant intrinsic point defects. Finally, metal-substituted MAPbBr(3) compounds of Bi, Sc, Ni, and Zr were experimentally investigated, and while there was an improvement in the thin-film morphology and an enhancement in charge carrier lifetimes, no clear evidence of subgap absorption features owing to the substituent being incorporated in the MAPbBr(3) lattice could be seen.

Here, we use synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence to map the composition of perovskite thin films. To get insight into the elemental distribution during film growth, we fabricate films with three different thicknesses. To create a link between the composition and electronic properties, we perform Kelvin probe force microscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy. We find that the elemental composition is highly dependent on the film thickness, in particular, the I/Pb ratio is altered for single grains based on the film thickness. The difference in the I/Pb ratio reveals to be the root cause for the underlying difference in the film lifetime and defect density influencing charge carrier dynamics. Our results provide an in-depth analysis approach combining micro- and nanoscale techniques to shed light onto the fundamental processes, which help to further engineer perovskite thin films and improve device efficiencies.

The key to realization of full potential of these materials lies however in the molecular level understanding of the processes triggered by light. Herein we highlight the knowledge gained from photophysical investigations on these NCs of various sizes and compositions employing primarily the femtosecond pump-probe technique. We show how spectral and temporal characterization of the photo-induced transients provide insight into the mechanism and dynamics of relaxation of hot and thermalized charge carriers through their recombination and trapping. We discuss how the multiple excitons including the charged ones (trions), generated using high pump fluence or photon energy, recombine through the Auger-assisted process. We discussed the harvesting of hot carriers prior to their cooling and band-edge carriers from these perovskite NCs to wide band-gap metal oxides, metal chalcogenide NCs and molecular acceptors. How perovskites can influence the charge carrier dynamics in composites of organic and inorganic semiconductors is also discussed.

It was found that the carrier polarity (hole-rich or electron-rich) inside the perovskite films played a critical role in the degradation rate, and the polarity-dependent degradation pathway strongly depended on the combination of the surrounding gaseous molecules. The hole-rich perovskite films degraded more rapidly than the electron-rich ones in the presence of H2O, while this degradation trend was reversed in oxygen-only ambient environments. Interestingly, the hole-rich film is extremely unstable in atmospheric air containing both H2O and O-2, whereas the MAPbI(3) film with excessive electrons was stable in air. An ab initio molecular dynamics simulation was performed to obtain the detailed degradation pathway of MAPbI(3) under atmospheric conditions for different polarities of the localized charge. The simulation results are in good agreement with experimental results, and the production of Pb(OH)I predicted in our simulations is confirmed by X-ray-assisted spectroscopic measurements.

However, to date, there is no satisfactory solution to achieve this, and the reported results of solar cells fabricated in ambient air vary significantly. It has been observed through studies of the turbid point, a time point at which the appearance of the precursor film changes from transparent to turbid, that the crystallization of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)) precursor films is strongly affected by humidity. A theoretical model based on the dependence of crystallization on evaporation was developed. We further designed a humidity-insensitive antisolvent method based on the turbid point and its tuning to control the fabrication of high-quality MAPbI(3) films and solar cells irrespective of the ambient humidity levels. Note that a champion device prepared in ambient air at 90% RH exhibits the efficiency of 19.5%, which is highest among those of the devices prepared in ambient air with over 30% RH. Our study may also impact other perovskite devices and inspire other researchers to perform innovative experiments.

However, it is not yet entirely clear how TMA, a strong Lewis acid, reacts with fresh perovskites and how the reaction affects the nucleation of ALD Al2O3. Here, the effects of reaction temperature and partial pressure of TMA on the mechanisms of TMA/CH3NH3PbI3 reactions are investigated. Our real time mass gain data and in situ mass spectrometry data show that the TMA/CH3NH3PbI3 reaction can either remove mass or accumulate mass onto CH3NH3PbI3 substrates, depending strongly on the reaction temperature and partial pressure of TMA. The TMA/CH3NH3PbI3 reaction probably generates TMA-CH(3)NHx adduct compounds, which protects CH3NH3PbI3 from TMA by forming a shell at 25 degrees C in the vacuum process. However, these adduct compounds decompose at higher temperatures (e.g., 75 degrees C). This product layer is much thicker than a monolayer, suggesting the interface formed between Al2O3 coating and CH3NH3PbI3 is blurring and messy. These results have not yet, but should be, carefully considered to correctly interpret the effect of ALD Al2O3 treatment on optoelectronic properties of CH3NH3PbI3.

Development of wide bandgap perovskites for next-generation low-cost CdTe tandem solar cells	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						Perovskites; Cadmium telluride; Tandem solar cell; Optical haze; Photovoltaics	POWER CONVERSION EFFICIENCY; LEAD IODIDE PEROVSKITE; LOW-TEMPERATURE; SILICON; CH3NH3PBBR3; MODULES; LAYER; BACK; CRYSTALLIZATION; DEGRADATION	To continue towards long-term reduction in the price of energy generated by photovoltaic (PV) solar cells, technological innovations are needed to achieve significant increases in device efficiency without increasing manufacturing costs. One approach is to utilize the existing capability to manufacture thin film CdTe PVs at very low cost and add another inexpensive thin film absorber to create a tandem solar cell to improve device efficiency. For this, a semiconductor with an optimal bandgap must be identified, along with a suitable device architecture. The wide bandgap perovskite methylammonium lead bromide (CH3NH3PbBr3, MAPBr) has a well-matched band gap of 2.3 eV for a CdTe tandem device. It can be processed at relatively low temperature, and is also suitable for CIGS and all-perovskite tandems. We fabricated MAPBr PVs and found that optical scattering, or haze, was significant in these perovskite layers. This limits the transmitted light reaching the bottom cell. The performance of a four-terminal (4T) perovskite-CdTe tandem cell was modeled using the 1D Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator (SCAPS) software package to determine how much haze could be tolerated and still achieve an efficiency boost compared to the CdTe cell.

We propose a machine learning-enabled approach to predict crystallographic dimensionality and space group from a limited number of thin-film XRD patterns. We overcome the scarce data problem intrinsic to novel materials development by coupling a supervised machine learning approach with a model-agnostic, physics-informed data augmentation strategy using simulated data from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) and experimental data. As a test case, 115 thin-film metalhalides spanning three dimensionalities and seven space groups are synthesized and classified. After testing various algorithms, we develop and implement an all convolutional neural network, with cross-validated accuracies for dimensionality and space group classification of 93 and 89%, respectively. We propose average class activation maps, computed from a global average pooling layer, to allow high model interpretability by human experimentalists, elucidating the root causes of misclassification. Finally, we systematically evaluate the maximum XRD pattern step size (data acquisition rate) before loss of predictive accuracy occurs, and determine it to be 0.16 degrees 2 theta, which enables an XRD pattern to be obtained and classified in 5.5 min or less.

Study on the overall energy performance of a novel c-Si based semitransparent solar photovoltaic window	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV); Semi-transparent solar cell; PV glazing; High-performance window; Net zero energy buildings; PV window	DOUBLE-SKIN FACADE; THERMAL PERFORMANCE; BUILDING INTEGRATION; PV; CELLS; PEROVSKITE; SILICON; COMFORT; INDOOR; ELEMENTS	This paper introduces a novel c-Si based building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) laminate. It was produced by cutting standard crystalline silicon solar cells into narrow strips and then automatically welding and connecting the strips into continuous strings for laminating between two layers of glass. The overall energy performance of the BIPV insulated glass unit (IGU) including power, thermal and daylighting performance was investigated experimentally. The daily energy conversion efficiency of the active solar cell area was about 15% on sunny days, but it was less than 12% on cloudy days and overcast days. Due to the combined effect of both the semi-transparent PV laminate and the insulated glass unit, the solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) of the BIPV IGU was as low as 0.25, which was much lower than commonly used glazing windows. Daylight analysis by means of high dynamic range (HDR) cameras and daylight glare probability (DGP) indicated that the BIPV IGU could reduce discomfort glare to some extent compared to clear glass windows. The net energy production of the BIPV IGU was estimated without considering the differences in HVAC energy use in this study. The artificial lighting energy consumption was about 431 W h/day while the average BIPV electricity production for the same period was 1940 W h/day. The net power generation was therefore 1509 W h/day for this BIPV IGU in Berkeley, California. Shading tests for the BIPV IGU were also conducted and the results revealed that the vertical configuration of solar cell wiring in the BIPV laminates was much more sensitive to horizontal shading patterns than vertical shading models. Thus, if shading was unavoidable in some cases, a reasonable arrangement of PV strings should be considered to bring down the energy loss as much as possible. Also, the impacts of environmental factors on the energy conversion efficiency of BIPV IGU were analyzed. Specifically, the power output declined by 0.42% of the peak power for each Celsius degree temperature rise. Thus, if more attention was paid to the heat dissipation issue of BIPV IGU, the overall energy conversion efficiency would be improved.

The CsPbBr3-xIx. samples have a high stability, with no apparent decrease in the catalytic activity after 50 h of repeated H-2 evolution experiments. The apparent quantum efficiency of CsPbBr3-xIx /Pt is determined to be 2.15% under the irradiation of 450 nm light.

We prepare polycrystalline films of perovskite semiconductors over laterally separated electron-and hole-selective materials of SnO2 and NiOx. Upon illumination, electrons (holes) generated over SnO2 (NiOx) rapidly transfer to the buried collection electrode, leaving holes (electrons) to diffuse laterally asmajority carriers in the perovskite layer. Under these conditions, we find recombination is strongly suppressed. Resulting surface recombination velocities are below 2 cm s(-1), approaching values of high-quality silicon. We find diffusion lengths exceed 12 mu m, an order of magnitude higher than reported in vertically stacked architectures. We fabricate back-contact solar cells with short-circuit currents as high as 18.4 mA cm(-2), reaching 70% external quantum efficiency.

Despite efficiencies of both perovskite SCs and LEDs are already among the best, the development of a perovskite dual functional device that is capable of working in these two regimes with high efficiencies is still challenging. Here we demonstrate that the dual functional device based on mixed halide perovskite CH3NH3PbBr2I can be switched from SC to LED with low threshold voltage V-th < 2 V by exposing to Sun at open circuit V-oc or at small bias voltage of V-pot similar to 1-2 V. Such photo-poling creates in-situ p-i-n junction via methylammonium (CH3NH3+, MA(+)) and I-/Br- ions migration to interfaces, lowering charge injection barriers, and self-balancing injection currents in perovskite LED. We show that before the photo-poling, the electroluminescence (EL) is highly unstable in LED regime, whereas after the photo-poling, stabilized EL exhibits unusual dynamics, increasing with time and poling cycle number, while V-th and injection current decrease with cycling runs. Additionally, photo-induced and current-induced halide segregation accumulates with cycling, that is found beneficial for LED, increasing its efficiency and brightness, but reversibly degrading photovoltaic performance, which can be easily recovered.

However, stability remains a great challenge when TiO2 or other wide bandgap n-type oxide semiconductors are used as the electron transport layer (ETL). The use of carbon such as fullerene (C-60) as an ETL has shown promise with much improved UV stability. But there are two major obstacles to overcome: the first is the difficulty to fabricate C-60 films with full coverage mainly due to the low solubility of fullerene in dichlorobenzene and the second is the hydrophobicity of C-60 that hinders the deposition of pin hole free perovskite films with high crystallinity, intimate contact, and a desired columnar microstructure. In this work, a C-60/ultrathin-TiOx (u-TiOx) bilayer is designed and fabricated as a compact ETL, which restrains the charge recombination at the ETL/perovskite interface and significantly enhances the PSC UV stability. Not only does the introduction of TiOx on top of the C-60 film fill the holes or gaps in the C-60 film, but also it enhances the surface energy benefiting the growth of perovskite with an intimate contact between the ETL and perovskite, which results in an enhanced perovskite crystallization and a reduced charge recombination at the interface. Both the open-circuit voltage and fill factor were largely improved to obtain a PCE of 19.38% with a rigid device. The highest efficiency 14.74% of a larger-area flexible PSC (1.0 cm(2)) based on the bilayer was obtained due to the superior homogeneity of the films. More importantly, by eliminating the negative charge accumulation at the perovskite/ETL interface and suppressing the irreversible moisture-driven decomposition of perovskite materials, the C-60/u-TiOx bilayer-based PSC shows outstanding stability, retaining 83% and 90% of its initial performance after 312 h UV irradiation and 1000 h exposure to ambient air, respectively.

Amine additive reactions induced by the soft Lewis acidity of Pb2+ in halide perovskites. Part II: impacts of amido Pb impurities in methylammonium lead triiodide thin films	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; CRYSTALLIZATION; DEGRADATION; PERFORMANCE; STABILITY; IODIDE	The performance of lead halide perovskite optoelectronic devices continues to improve, yet the efficiencies are still well below the radiative limit. To approach the radiative limit, detailed understanding of impurities/defects and precise control over their concentrations are required. In Part I, we demonstrated that the soft Lewis acidity of Pb2+ induces a chemical reaction between PbI2 and aliphatic amines producing Pb-alkylamide bonds which can be subsequently incorporated into thin films. Here, we investigate the consequences of these impurities in methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI(3)) thin films. In particular, we link Pb-alkylamide impurities to an extrinsic degradation pathway resulting in Pb-0 formation. The proposed mechanisms proceeds via -C-H proton transfer reactions of the amido Pb species. Metallic Pb+/Pb-0 defects acting as non-radiative recombination centers may limit the performance of many perovskite layers. However, optimal concentrations of Pb-methylamide impurities in sub-stoichiometric (slight excess of PbI2) MAPbI(3) films passivate Pb-0 defect formation, shown here to simultaneously correlate to improvements in photoluminescence lifetime. These results elucidate the beneficial properties of Pb-amide impurities in low concentrations and the sensitivity of halide perovskite materials to extrinsic defect chemistry.

Amine additive reactions induced by the soft Lewis acidity of Pb2+ in halide perovskites. Part I: evidence for Pb-alkylamide formation	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; COORDINATION POLYMERS; THIN-FILMS; PERFORMANCE; PHOTOLUMINESCENCE; CRYSTALLIZATION; BEHAVIOR	Metal halide perovskite materials (ABX(3)) employed in optoelectronic devices have rapidly achieved high efficiencies. Their performance can be partially attributed to intrinsic defects being electronically benign. Despite the inertness of defects within the bulk, such as ion vacancies, solution processing additives and surface passivation have been shown to enhance material properties. Thus, detailed knowledge of additive chemistry is desirous to elucidate passivation mechanisms and facilitate further improvements. In particular, the soft Lewis acid nature of Pb2+ has been overlooked heretofore as a key feature of amine-lead chemistry in perovskite preparations. In Part I of this study, we demonstrate that acid-base reactions between PbI2 and aliphatic amines yield alkylammonium and Pb-alkylamide species. The alkylammonium and alkylamide products are capable of occupying A-site cation and anion vacancies, respectively. Subsequent incorporation of these impurities at perovskite crystal surfaces or formation of non-perovskite phase inclusions likely influence the perovskite layer morphology and properties which are investigated in Part II. These results reveal a new mechanism by which optoelectronic properties of perovskites can be chemically modified. Additionally, the general concept of acidification of organic molecules solvated to Pb2+ promoting unexpected reactions is applied to explain amine reactions with other additives, such as formic acid. Understanding acid-base reactions induced by PbI2 complexing to protic molecules is useful to comprehend and predict defect/impurity chemistry in a wide variety of perovskite precursor formulations.

Shining Light on Sulfide Perovskites: LaYS3 Material Properties and Solar Cells	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							CHALCOGENIDE PEROVSKITES; INTERFACES; MOBILITY; YTTRIUM	The sulfide perovskite LaYS3 has been recently identified as a promising wide band gap photoabsorber material by computational screening techniques. In this study, we combine experiment and theory to comprehensively characterize LaYS3 thin films produced by sulfurization of sputter-deposited precursors. An attractive feature of LaYS3 is its optimal band gap (2.0 eV) for application as a wide band gap photoabsorber in tandem solar energy conversion devices. Promisingly, the LaYS3 films are photoconductive, with a grain size in excess of 1 mu m and comparable recombination time scales to state-of-the-art hybrid halide perovskite absorbers. Although the fabrication of solar cells based on LaYS3 absorbers is complicated by the high temperature necessary to grow the compound, complete solar cells could be produced in this work by growing LaYS3 on refractory metal back contacts. These are the first reported solar cells based on a sulfide perovskite absorber. A major reason for their poor performance could be the highly localized trap states observed directly by photoluminescence imaging of LaYS3, which may also explain the surprisingly long carrier lifetimes and the low carrier mobility found in this material.

Efficient Production of Phosphorene Nanosheets via Shear Stress Mediated Exfoliation for Low-Temperature Perovskite Solar Cells	SMALL METHODS			English	Article						2D materials; black phosphorus; electron transporting materials; perovskite solar cells; phosphorene	BLACK PHOSPHORUS; LIQUID-EXFOLIATION; HIGHLY EFFICIENT; 2D PHOSPHORENE; LAYERS; SCALE	A simple and fast "top-down" protocol is introduced herein to prepare solution processable few-layer phosphorene nanosheets using vortex fluidic mediated exfoliation under near-infrared (NIR) pulsed laser irradiation. This novel shear-exfoliation method requires short processing times and produces highly crystalline, atomically thin phosphorene nanosheets (4.3 +/- 0.4 nm). The as-prepared phosphorene nanosheets are used as an effective electron transporting material (ETM) for low-temperature processed, planar n-i-p perovskite solar cells (PSCs). With the addition of phosphorene, the average power conversion efficiency (PCE) increases from 14.32% to 16.53% with a maximum PCE of 17.85% observed for the phosphorene incorporated PSCs which is comparable to the devices made using the traditional high-temperature protocol. Experimental and theoretical (density-functional theory) investigations reveal the PCE improvements are due to the high carrier mobility and suitable band energy alignment of the phosphorene. The work not only paves the way for novel synthesis of 2D materials, but also opens a new avenue in using phosphorene as an efficient ETM in photovoltaic devices.

However, the performance of all-perovskite-based tandem devices has been limited by the lack of high-efficiency, low-band gap tin-lead (Sn-Pb) mixed-perovskite solar cells (PSCs). We found that the addition of guanidinium thiocyanate (GuaSCN) resulted in marked improvements in the structural and optoelectronic properties of Sn-Pb mixed, low-band gap (similar to 1.25 electron volt) perovskite films. The films have defect densities that are lower by a factor of 10, leading to carrier lifetimes of greater than 1 microsecond and diffusion lengths of 2.5 micrometers. These improved properties enable our demonstration of >20% efficient low-band gap PSCs. When combined with wider-band gap PSCs, we achieve 25% efficient four-terminal and 23.1% efficient two-terminal all-perovskite-based polycrystalline thin-film tandem solar cells.

Here, the effect of chloride additives is studied on the bulk and surface defects of the mixed cation and halide PSCs. It is found that using an antisolvent technique, the perovskite film is divided into two layers, i.e., a bottom layer with large grains and a thin capping layer with small grains. The addition of formamidinium chloride (FACl) into the precursor solution removes the small-grained perovskite capping layer and suppresses the formation of bulk and surface defects, providing a perovskite film with enhanced crystallinity and large grain size of over 1 mu m. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements show longer lifetimes for perovskite films modified by FACl and subsequently passivated by 1-adamantylamine hydrochloride as compared to the reference sample. Impedance spectroscopy measurements show that these treatments reduce the recombination in the PSCs, leading to a champion device with power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.2%, an open circuit voltage of 1152 mV and negligible hysteresis. The Cl treated PSC also shows improved operational stability with only 12% PCE loss after 700 h under continuous illumination.

IHPs are generally expected to exhibit superior chemical stability over the prevailing hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites that are widely used in optoelectronic devices such as solar cells and lightemitting devices. This is primarily owing to the elimination of weakly-bonded organic components in the IHP crystal structure. Nevertheless, many recent studies have revealed that IHPs still suffer significant issues in chemical instability, and thus, a lot of effort has been made towards the stabilization of IHPs for high-performance devices. In this context, a great deal of interest in the chemistry and perovskite community has been emerging to understand the chemical (in) stability of IHPs and develop engineering strategies for making more robust perovskite devices. This review will summarize the past research progress in this direction, give insights into the IHP (in) stability, and provide perspectives for the future effort in making stable IHP materials and devices.

Despite this impressive increase, significant issues still remain due to the intrinsic instability of CH3NH3PbI3 which degrades into carcinogenic PbI2. Recently, double halide perovskites which use a pair of 1(+)-3(+) cations to replace Pb2+, such as Cs2InSbI6, and chalcogenide perovskites, such as BaZrS3, have been explored as potential replacements. In this work, double chalcogenide perovskites are explored to identify novel photovoltaic absorbers that can replace CH3NH3PbI3. Due to the large space of possible compounds, machine learning methods are used to classify materials as potential photovoltaic absorbers using data from the periodic table, eliminating wasteful computation. A random forest algorithm achieves a cross-validation accuracy of 86.4% on the constructed data set. Over 450 possible replacements are identified via traditional and statistical methods with Ba2AlNbS6, Ba2GaNbS6, Ca2GaNbS6, Sr2InNbS6, and Ba2SnHfS6 as the most promising alternative when thermodynamic stability, kinetic stability, and optical absorption are considered.

This work addresses these limitations by leveraging large-area processing and robust inorganic hole transport layers (HTLs). Inverted perovskite solar cells utilizing NiOx HTLs deposited by rapid aqueous spray-coating that outperform spin-coated NiOx and lead to a 5x improvement in the fracture energy (G(c)), a primary metric of thermomechanical stability, are presented. The morphology, chemical composition, and optoelectronic properties of the NiOx films are characterized to understand and optimize compatibility with an archetypal double cation perovskite, Cs(.17)FA(.83)Pb(Br.17I.83)(3). Perovskite solar cells with sprayed NiOx show higher photovoltaic performance, exhibiting up to 82% fill factor and 17.7% power conversion efficiency (PCE)the highest PCE reported for inverted cell with scalable charge transport layersas well as excellent stability under full illumination and after 4000 h aging in inert conditions at room temperature. By utilizing open-air techniques and aqueous precursors, this combination of robust materials and low-cost processing provides a platform for scaling perovskite modules with long-term reliability.

However commercial development is seriously hindered by the instability of the perovskite, especially under moisture conditions. Therefore it is crucial to gain clear understanding of the mechanism of degradation of organic-inorganic perovskite in order to achieve stable perovskite devices. In this paper, the formation and the degradation of perovskite film on different charge transport layers such as a compact TiO2 layer, compact ZnO layer, and ZnO foil, Si nanowires, and porous Si are studied. In addition, density functional theory studies are carried out to better understand the interaction between the perovskite film and substrates. Experimental and theoretical results are combined to draw more reliable conclusion regarding the degradation mechanism. Most notably, the investigations show that the interaction between the iodine (I) atom in the perovskite layer and substrate determine the stability of perovskite cells.

Plasmonic Metal Nanoparticles with Core-Bishell Structure for High-Performance Organic and Perovskite Solar Cells	ACS NANO			English	Article						plasmonic nanostructures; light absorption; organic solar cells; perovskite solar cell; charge recombination	EFFICIENT; GENERATION; CONVERSION; REDUCTION; JUNCTION; DESIGN; LAYER	To maximize light coupling into the active layer, plasmonic nanostructures have been incorporated into both active layers of organic solar cells (OSCs) and perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with the aim of increasing light absorption, but reports have shown controversial results in electrical characteristics. In this work, we introduce a core bishell concept to build plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) with metal inorganic semiconductor organic semiconductor nanostructure. Specifically, Ag NPs were decorated with a titania/benzoic-acid-fullerene bishell (Ag@TiO2@Pa), which enables the NPs to be compatible with fullerene acceptors or a perovskite absorber. Moreover, coating the Ag@TiO2 NP with a fullerene shell can activate efficient plasmon exciton coupling and eliminate the charge accumulation, thus facilitating exciton dissociation and reducing the monomolecular recombination. The improved light absorption and enhanced carrier extraction of devices with Ag@TiO(2)pPa nanoparticles are responsible for the improved short-circuit current and fill factor, respectively. On the basis of the synergistic effects (optical and electrical), a series of plasmonic OSCs exhibited enhancement of 12.3-20.7% with a maximum power conversion efficiency of 13.0%, while the performance of plasmonic PSCs also showed an enhancement by 10.2% from 18.4% to 20.2%. This core bishell design concept of plasmonic nanostructures demonstrates a general approach to improving the photovoltaic performance with both optical and electrical contributions.

CsSnX3 nanowires with controllable orientations and dimensions can further enable integrated optoelectronic devices and facilitate physical studies, but they are challenging to synthesize. Here, a facile and robust vapor-phase epitaxial method is developed to produce horizontally aligned high-quality CsSnX3 nanowires and microwires with controllable dimensions on mica substrate for the first time. CsSnI3 is in the alpha-cubic perovskite phase at the growth temperature, thus enabling the anisotropic lattice match with mica and epitaxial growth of the wires. The vapor growth is tolerant of Sn4+ in the SnX2 precursor and produces high-quality materials regardless of the protective environment. Temperature- and power-dependent photoluminescence spectra reveal positive thermal expansion of the CsSnBr3 wires upon temperature increase and that the nonradiative recombination processes CsSnBr3 in are largely suppressed below 225 K.

Mn2+ Doping Enhances the Brightness, Efficiency, and Stability of Bulk Perovskite Light-Emitting Diodes	ACS PHOTONICS			English	Article						lead halide perovskites; light-emitting diodes; Mn doping; stability	MIXED-HALIDE PEROVSKITES; SOLAR-CELLS; BLUE; NANOCRYSTALS	Interest in organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite (ABX(3)) LEDs has exploded over the past several years, yet significant gains in stability, efficiency, and brightness are required before commercialization is possible, particularly for blue devices. The perovskite composition has been shown to play a crucial role in its performance, yet to date nearly all existing reports focus on tuning the A-site composition. Here, we find that doping the B-site with manganese allows us to achieve bright, efficient, and stable LEDs regardless of A or X composition. By doping with Mn, we demonstrate ultrabright sky-blue, green, and red perovskite LEDs with a maximum brightness of 11800, 97000, and 1470 cd/m(2) and quantum efficiencies of 0.58%, 3.2%, and 5.1%, respectively. Crucially, these devices show excellent operational stability, with the sky-blue devices lasting for 20 min and red devices over 5 h with strong spectral stability. Moreover, the green devices showed over 1% efficiency even at higher current densities, similar to 2000 mA/cm(2). Mn doping allows for universal improvement in perovskite performance and stability, opening the door to a huge number of applications.

The results are extremely promising in that they showcase comparable cell efficiencies, with the Bi-based device showing a highest 20.0% efficiency (Jsc of 256 A.m-2, Voc of 1.04V, FF of 0.75) at 450nm active layer thickness compared to 23.4% of its Pb counterpart (Jsc of 349.3 A.m-2, Voc of 0.81V, FF of 0.83) at 850nm active layer thickness. The Bi-based device can thus be manufactured at approximately half its Pb-counterpart active layer thickness, to give its optimal efficiency value. A deeper study of each of the Jsc, Voc and FF trends provide keen insight into charge transfer kinetics within the device, paving the way to optimal experimental setups for fabricating the most efficient non-toxic perovskite devices.

Typically, PLQY can be increased by improving the material quality to reduce the nonradiative recombination rate. It is in principle equally effective to improve the optical design by nano-structuring a material to increase light out-coupling efficiency (OCE) and introduce quantum confinement, both of which can increase the radiative recombination rate. However, increased surface recombination typically minimizes nanostructure gains in PLQY. Here a template-guided vapor phase growth of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI(3)) nanowire (NW) arrays with unprecedented control of NW diameter from the bulk (250 nm) to the quantum confined regime (5.7 nm) is demonstrated, while simultaneously providing a low surface recombination velocity of 18 cm s(-1). This enables a 56-fold increase in the internal PLQY, from 0.81% to 45.1%, and a 2.3-fold increase in OCEy to increase the external PLQY by a factor of 130, from 0.33% up to 42.6%, exclusively using nanophotonic design.

However, its low electron mobility, complexity in achieving quality film formation, and severe nonradiative recombination at perovskite/PCBM interface due to the large electron capture region, lead to lower efficiency for inverted PSCs compared to the normal structures. Herein, we demonstrate an effective and practical strategy to overcome these challenges. Conjugated n-type polymeric materials are mixed together with PCBM to form a homogeneous bulk-mixed (HBM) continuous film with high electron mobility and suitable energy level. HBM film is found to completely cap the perovskite surface to enhance the electron extraction. The critical electron capture radius of the HBM decreases to 12.52 nm from 14.89 nm of PCBM due to the large relative permittivity, resulting in reduced nonradiative recombination at perovskite/HBM interface. The efficiency of inverted PSCs with HBM ETLs exceeds 20.6% with a high fill factor of 0.82. Further, the stability of devices is improved owing to the high hydrophobicity of the HBM ETLs. Under ambient air condition after 45 days, the efficiency of inverted PSCs based on HBM remains 80% of the initial value. This is significantly higher than the control devices which retain only 48% of the initial value under similar aging conditions. We believe these breakthroughs in improving efficiency and stability of inverted PSCs will expedite their transition.

Among all defects, halide anion and organic cation vacancies are ubiquitous, promoting ion diffusion and leading to thin-film decomposition at surfaces and grain boundaries. Here, we employ fluoride to simultaneously passivate both anion and cation vacancies, by taking advantage of the extremely high electronegativity of fluoride. We obtain a power conversion efficiency of 21.46% (and a certified 21.3%-efficient cell) in a device based on the caesium, methylammonium (MA) and for-mamidinium (FA) triple-cation perovskite (Cs(0.05)FA(0.54)MA(0.41))Pb(I0.98Br0.02)(3) treated with sodium fluoride. The device retains 90% of its original power conversion efficiency after 1,000 h of operation at the maximum power point. With the help of first-principles density functional theory calculations, we argue that the fluoride ions suppress the formation of halide anion and organic cation vacancies, through a unique strengthening of the chemical bonds with the surrounding lead and organic cations.

Here, we examine the correlation between film thickness, lead halide sources in the precursors, and film morphology, with the optical efficiency of planar PVSK LSCs with a view to optimizing device performance. After synthesizing and testing sixteen different types of PVSK samples, we report a maximum optical efficiency of 34.7% in CH3NH3PbI3 LSC made with Pb(Ac)(2) precursor, and with optimal thickness in the 150-300 nm range. Using 3D Monte Carlo simulations that incorporate experimental results, we accurately estimate self-absorption and surface losses, and most importantly, demonstrate the possibility of scaling these LSCs up to almost 100 cm, thereby providing a route toward optimizing thin film PVSK materials for these and other optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications.

The photocatalyst was successfully prepared by a low temperature solvo-termal method, easily reproducible. The catalyst was characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FP-IR), X-ray diffraction spectrometer (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques and UV diffuse reflectance spectrum. The efficiency of photocatalyst was tested for the removal of different type of dyes: fluorone dye (rhodamine B), thiazine dye (methylene blue) and azo dye (reactive Blue 4). Moreover, a multi-contaminated solution, with methylene blue and crystal violet (triarylmethane dye), was used to simulate a real industrial wastewater effluent. The results highlighted an increase of the photocatalytic activity respect the pristine precursor, bismuth iodide. The experiments showed that the values of removal was higher for rhodamine B respect the other dyes, with a removal of 98% after three hours under visible light irradiation. The efficiency of the photocatalyst was also confirmed under optimal conditions with high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The gradual disappearance of rhodamine B peak accompanied by the appearance of by-products peaks was investigated. The stability of the photocatalyst was tested for three consecutive re-cycles. Analysis on different visible light sources was performed: halogen provided higher efficiency respect LED lamp. The outcomes of the present work aim to open the possibility of considering HOIP as a new potential photocatalyst for contaminants treatment.

However, it is still challenging to obtain perovskite layers with required properties including large grain sizes, better crystallinity, less grain boundaries, and uniform morphology by the current preparation techniques. Here we develop a novel method, where the CsPbBr3 nanoparticles (NPs) are introduced into the chlorobenzene anti-solvent to improve the MAPbI(3) film quality in terms of film structure, morphology and crystallinity, leading to reduced charge recombination and improved charge transfer. CsPbBr3 NPs play a role as nucleation centers in the growth process of perovskite films, and CsPbBr3 NPs also induce a passivation layer Cs(1-y)MA(y)PbI(3-x)Br(x) on the top of perovskite layer. The charge transport and power conversion efficiency (PCE) are improved due to the introduction of CsPbBr3 NPs. A champion PCE of 20.46% is obtained for the PSCs based on high quality perovskite film prepared with CsPbBr3 NPs. In addition, the PSCs with CsPbBr3 NPs also exhibit improved stability. This work not only demonstrates a novel strategy to prepare high quality perovskite films for PSCs with high efficiency and stability, but also provides important insight in the growth mechanisms of perovskite films toward high crystallinity and less defects.

There is much less effort into the understanding of the structure and electronic properties than into device optimization. The highest efficiency usually appears some time (a couple of days) after the device fabrication, but the underlying mechanism is rarely in the limelight. Here we study device performance under different storage environments. We utilize X-ray diffraction, time-resolved photoluminescence, transient absorption spectrometer, and single-carrier diode measurement to understand the structure and electronic properties of perovskite films for the time scale of weeks. We observe enhanced crystallinity and crystallite size, referred to age-induced recrystallization. Based on the structural changes, the charge trap and recombination are suppressed, while charge transport and collection are enhanced, ultimately improving device efficiency.

Here, we report CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI(3)) perovskite photo detectors (PDs) with Ga-doped ZnO nanorods (GZO NRs), prepared by the water bath method, as a scaffold structure electron transport layer (ETL). Our MoO3 hole transport layer (HTL) based perovskite PDs using GZO NRs as a scaffold showed a larger light/dark current (I-ph/I-dark) ratio, higher responsivity and detectivity than those of the undoped ZnO NRs/MAPbI(3) devices at zero bias. These enhancements are attributed to the incorporation of Ga atoms into the ZnO NRs, which reduce the density defect states of ZnO NRs and improves the performance of MAPbI(3) perovskite PDs. In addition, by taking advantage of the GZO NRs scaffold structure, a HTL-free perovskite PD was prepared by using graphite electrodes. The graphite-connected device shows self powered PD performances with an I-ph/I-dark ratio of similar to 2.5 x 10(3), responsivity of above 0.3 A/W and detectivity of 1.3 x 10(12) Jones, all of which are comparable with those of MoO3 HTL based perovskite PDs.

To further achieve a win-win situation of both performance and stability, an innovative conjugated aniline modifier (3-phenyl-2-propen-1-amine; PPEA) is explored to moderately tailor organolead halide perovskites films. Here, the conjugated PPEA presents both "quasi-coplanar" rigid geometrical configuration and distinct electron delocalization characteristics. After a moderate treatment, a stronger dipole capping layer can be formed at the perovskite/ transporting interface to achieve favorable banding alignment, thus enlarging the built-in potential and promoting charge extraction. Meanwhile, a conjugated cation coordinated to the surface of the perovskite grains/units can form preferably ordered overlapping, not only passivating the surface defects but also providing a fast path for charge exchange. Benefiting from this, a approximate to 21% efficiency of the PPEA-modified solar cell can be obtained, accompanied by long-term stability (maintaining 90.2% of initial power conversion efficiency after 1000 h testing, 25 degrees C, and 40 +/- 10 humidity).

Optics of Perovskite Solar Cell Front Contacts	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						perovskite; solar cells; metal oxides; light incoupling; light trapping; zinc oxide; TCO	EFFICIENCY; FABRICATION; LIMIT; TCO	The front contact has a major impact on the electrical and optical properties of perovskite solar cells. The front contact is part of the junction of the solar cell and must provide lateral charge transport to the terminals and should allow for an efficient light incoupling, while having low optical losses. The complex requirements of the perovskite solar front contact will be described and the optics of the front contact will be investigated. It will be shown that the front contact has a distinct influence on the short-circuit current and energy conversion efficiency. Metal oxide films were investigated as potential front contacts. The incoupling of light in the solar cell is investigated by three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain optical simulations and optical measurements of experimentally realized self-textured zinc oxide films. The zinc oxide films were prepared by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition at low temperatures. Furthermore, the influence of free carrier absorption of metal oxide films on the optics of low bandgap and/or tandem solar cells is investigated. Guidelines are provided on how to choose the doping concentration and thickness of the metal oxide films. Finally, it will be shown that by selecting an optimal front contact design the short-circuit current and energy conversion efficiency can be increased by at least 15%.

Photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS) is employed to probe the relative defect density of all films by way of extracting the Urbach energy characterizing the width of the sub-bandgap absorption tail. Exposure to atmosphere for similar to 3 min prior to PDS measurement is found to degrade mixed composition films such that exposed films had an average increase of 36% in Urbach energies compared to those that are fully kept out of atmosphere through immersion in inert C6F14 liquid. By contrast, the same exposure to atmosphere induced no change in Urbach energy for MA(0.7)FA(0.3)PbI(3). These results demonstrate the influence of ambient exposure on perovskites, particularly those containing Sn, and highlight the fact that handling procedure itself throughout all fabrication and subsequent characterization steps influences the measured results.

Due to their diverse physicochemical properties and favourable attributes, such as quantum confinement effects and abundant surface defects, CDs and their derived hybrids have shown exciting and indispensable prospects in the energy conversion and storage fields. Considering the latest developments, in this review, we comprehensively summarize the classification and structure of CDs. Three strategies for structural engineering of CDs are presented and analyzed, in terms of the tuning of size and crystallinity, and the methodologies for surface modification and heteroatom doping, with a focus on the relationship among the synthesis methods, structure and properties of the concerned CDs. More importantly, the recent advances in energy-oriented applications of CDs, including photo-and electro-catalysis, light-emitting diodes, photovoltaic cells, lithium/ sodium ion batteries and supercapacitors, will be systematically highlighted. Finally, we discuss and outline the remaining major challenges and opportunities for CDs in the future.

To date, applying 1D perovskites as active materials for solar cells has not been as well explored as 3D and 2D perovskites. Herein, we report a new low-dimensional hybrid perovskite based on 1D 1,4-benzene diammonium lead iodide (BDAPbI(4)) perovskite. Counterintuitive to the general belief, a high efficiency of up to 14% was achieved for solar cells based on low-dimensional hybrid perovskites containing 1D BDAPbI(4) and 3D MAPbI(3). More importantly, these solar cells can retain over 95% of their efficiency upon storage for over 1000h and show impressive stability under continuous illumination and heating.

However, complete substitution of Pb by Sn undermines the stability of perovskite materials and devices. Therefore, partial substitution of Pb by Sn has attracted much interest to balance environmental considerations and device performance. Here, we exploit the Sn ratio to optimize the band alignment in Pb-Sn mixed perovskite solar cells with an inverted structure. The band edge properties of Pb-Sn mixed triple cation perovskites (Cs/MA/FAPb(1-x)Sn(x)X(3), X = Cl, Br, I) for efficient inverted solar cells are studied via simulation and experiment. The optimized solar cell with x = 0.336 shows the highest power conversion efficiency of 16.10% along with negligible hysteresis. We demonstrate that the devices are stable and maintain 93% of the initial PCE under ambient conditions for 30 days. These results suggest that bandgap engineering is a feasible approach to balance the efficiency and stability of Pb-Sn mixed PSCs.

Quantum- cutting Yb3+- doped perovskite nanocrystals for monolithic bilayer luminescent solar concentrators	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							THIN-FILMS; SEMICONDUCTOR NANOCRYSTALS; STOKES-SHIFT; MONTE-CARLO; EFFICIENCY; DOTS; PERFORMANCE; ABSORPTION; ENERGY; PHOTOLUMINESCENCE	Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) can concentrate direct and diffuse solar radiation spatially and energetically to help reduce the overall area of solar cells needed to meet current energy demands. LSCs require luminophores that absorb large fractions of the solar spectrum, emit photons into a light-capture medium with high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs), and do not absorb their own photoluminescence. Luminescent nanocrystals (NCs) with near or above unity PLQYs and Stokes shifts large enough to avoid self-absorption losses are well-suited to meet these needs. In this work, we describe LSCs based on quantum-cutting Yb3+:CsPb(Cl1-xBrx)(3) NCs that have documented PLQYs as high as approximate to 200%. Through a combination of solution-phase 1D LSC measurements and modeling, we demonstrate that Yb3+:CsPbCl3 NC LSCs show negligible intrinsic reabsorption losses, and we use these data to model the performance of large-scale 2D LSCs based on these NCs. We further propose a new and unique monolithic bilayer LSC device architecture that contains a Yb3+:CsPb(Cl1-xBrx)(3) NC top layer above a second narrower-gap LSC bottom layer (e.g., based on CuInS2 NCs), both within the same waveguide and interfaced with the same Si PV for conversion. We extend the modeling to predict the flux gains of such bilayer devices. Because of the exceptionally high PLQYs of Yb3+:CsPb(Cl1-xBrx)(3) NCs, the optimized bilayer device has a projected flux gain of 63 for dimensions of 70 x 70 x 0.1 cm(3), representing performance enhancement of at least 19% over the optimized CuInS2 LSC alone.

Bi-doped MAPbI(3) thin film samples are fabricated, and it is found that Bi doping could greatly enhance the stability and thermoelectric properties of MAPbI(3). The Bi dopant located at the grain boundaries to modify the carrier channel near grain boundaries, which is observed via scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy, efficiently reduces ion migration and facilitates charge transport. In addition, the Bi dopant can also passivate the defects in bulk MAPbI(3), increasing the polarization effect of MAPbI(3) which is demonstrated by the capacitance-frequency measurement, thus greatly enhancing the mobility of Bi-doped MAPbI(3). In addition, Bi-doped MAPbI(3) leads to grain size reduction; the small size effect not only effectively hinders the MAPbI(3)'s crystal phase transition from the tetragonal phase to the cubic phase, but it could also make the structure of MAPbI(3) more stable. Especially, the Seebeck voltage variation of Bi-doped perovskite was less than that of the undoped one, meaning Bi doping would lead to a much more stable state in MAPbI(3) thin films. The results show that Bi-doped MAPbI(3) is a promising approach to develop high stable thermoelectric and photovoltaic properties in organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite materials.

Due to the long diffusion lengths of charge carriers in the photoactive layer, a PSC device architecture comprising an electron-transporting layer (ETL) is essential to optimize charge flow and collection for maximum performance. Here, a novel approach is reported to low temperature, solution-processed ZnO ETLs for PSCs using combustion synthesis. Due to the intrinsic passivation effects, high crystallinity, matched energy levels, ideal surface topography, and good chemical compatibility with the perovskite layer, this combustion-derived ZnO enables PCEs approaching 17-20% for three types of perovskite materials systems with no need for ETL doping or surface functionalization.

The Role of Antireflective Coating CYTOP, Immersion Oil, and Sensitizer Selection in Fabricating a 2.3 V, 10% Power Conversion Efficiency SSM-DSC Device	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						antireflective coatings; dye-sensitized solar cells; high voltage solar cells; multijunction solar cells; SSM-DSCs	SOLAR-CELLS; ORGANIC-DYES; PEROVSKITE; PHOTOVOLTAICS; REDUCTION; ENERGY	Sequential series multijunction dye-sensitized solar cells (SSM-DSCs) can power solar-to-fuel processes with a single illuminated area device. Dye selection and strategies limiting photon losses are critical in SSM-DSC devices for higher performance systems. Herein, an efficient and readily applicable spin coating protocol on glass surfaces with an antireflective fluoropolymer (CYTOP) is applied to an SSM-DSC architecture. Combining CYTOP with the use of an immersion oil between glass spacers in a three subcell SSM-DSC with judiciously selected TiO2 photoanode sensitizers and thicknesses, an overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.1% is obtained with an output of 2.3 V. Without external bias, this SSM-DSC configuration shows an impressive overall solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency of 6% when powering IrO2 and Au2O3 electrocatalysts for CO2 and H2O to CO and H-2 conversion in aqueous solution. The role of CYTOP, immersion oil, sensitizer selection, and film thickness on SSM-DSC devices is discussed along with the stability of this system.

Here, we investigated the effect of pressure on the optoelectronic properties and crystal structure of (CH3NH3)(3)Bi2I9 up to 65 GPa at room temperature. We achieved impressive photoluminescence enhancement and band gap narrowing over a moderate pressure range. Dramatic piezochromism from transparent red to opaque black was observed in a single crystal sample. A structural phase transition from hexagonal P6(3)/mmc to monoclinic P2(1) at 5.0 GPa and completely reversible amorphization at 29.1 GPa were determined by in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction. Moreover, the dynamically disordered MA(+) organic cations in the hexagonal phase became orientationally ordered upon entering into the monoclinic phase, followed by static disorder upon amorphization. The striking enhancement of conductivity and metallization under high pressure indicate wholly new electronic properties.

Low-Frequency Carrier Kinetics in Perovskite Solar Cells	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						hybrid perovskite solar cells; I/f noise; impedance spectroscopy; degradation; mobile ions; methylammonium lead iodide	HALIDE PEROVSKITES; INDUCTIVE LOOP; TIN OXIDE; NOISE; RECOMBINATION; POLARIZATION; SPECTROSCOPY; DEGRADATION; CAPACITANCE; HYSTERESIS	Hybrid organic-inorganic halide perovskite solar cells have emerged as leading candidates for third-generation photovoltaic technology. Despite the rapid improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) for perovskite solar cells in recent years, the low frequency carrier kinetics that underlie practical roadblocks such as hysteresis and degradation remain relatively poorly understood. In an 10." effort to bridge this knowledge gap, we perform here correlated low frequency noise (LFN) and impedance spectroscopy (IS) characterization that elucidates carrier kinetics in operating perovskite solar cells. Specifically, we focus on planar cell geometries with a SnO, electron transport layer and two different hole transport layers namely, poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) and spiro-OMeTAD. PTAA and spiro-OMeTAD cells with moderate PCEs of 5-12% possess a Lorentzian feature at-200 Hz in LFN measurements that corresponds to a crossover from electrode to dielectric polarization. In comparison, spiro-OMeTAD cells with high PCEs (>15%) show 4 orders of magnitude lower LFN amplitude and are accompanied by a cyclostationary process. Through a systematic study of more than a dozen solar cells, we establish a correlation with noise amplitude, PCE, and fill factor. Overall, this work establishes correlated LFN and IS as an effective methodology for quantifying low-frequency carrier kinetics in perovskite solar cells, thereby providing new physical insights that can rationally guide ongoing efforts to improve device performance, reproducibility, and stability.

Herein, we directly embedded surfactant-like monoammonium zinc porphyrin (ZnP) compound into the methylammonium (MA(+)) lead iodide perovskite film to blade-coat large-area uniform perovskite films as large as 16 cm(2). Efficiency as high as 18.3% for blade-coating large-area (1.96 cm(2)) PSCs with ZnP was unprecedentedly achieved, while the best efficiency of fabricated small-area (0.1 cm(2)) device was up to 20.5%. The detailed analyses demonstrated the functions of ZnP in crystallization control and defects passivation of perovskite surfaces and grain boundaries. As a consequence, the ZnP-encapsulated devices retained over 90% of its initial efficiency after 1000 h with a humidity of about 45% at 85 degrees C. This research presents a facile way to achieve the synergistic effect of large area coating, morphology tailoring, and defect suppression based on the molecular encapsulation strategy for perovskite films, further improving the photovoltaic performance and stability of PSCs.

This remarkable progress stems from the high absorption coefficient, large charge carrier diffusion length, low exciton binding energy and low trap density of the perovskite materials. In this work, we investigate the role of A-site cations in the open-circuit voltage (V-oc) in the state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells using well-known rubidium (Rb) and guanidinium (GA) cations. Our results indicate that V-oc of the perovskite solar cells is controlled by the nature of the A-site cations. We found that the reduced doping density in Rb and GA-based devices yields a wider junction suggesting that the effective charge extraction at the interface can affect the open circuit voltage (V-oc) of the devices. This study illustrates a convenient way for in-depth characterization and better understanding of the working mechanism in efficient PSCs upon addition of an extra ancillary cation.

Spin coating epitaxial films	SCIENCE			English	Article							SINGLE-CRYSTAL GOLD; CHEMICAL EPITAXY; THIN-FILMS; ELECTRODEPOSITION; ZNO	Spin-coated films, such as photoresists for lithography or perovskite films for solar cells, are either amorphous or polycrystalline. We show that epitaxial films of inorganic materials such as cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3), lead(II) iodide (PbI2), zinc oxide (ZnO), and sodium chloride (NaCl) can be deposited onto a variety of single-crystal and single-crystal-like substrates by simply spin coating either solutions of the material or precursors to the material. The out-of-plane and in-plane orientations of the spin-coated films are determined by the substrate. The thin stagnant layer of supersaturated solution produced during spin coating promotes heterogeneous nucleation of the material onto the single-crystal substrate over homogeneous nucleation in the bulk solution, and ordered anion adlayers may lower the activation energy for nucleation on the surface. The method can be used to produce functional materials such as inorganic semiconductors or to deposit water-soluble materials such as NaCl that can serve as growth templates.

However, their water interaction and degradation mechanisms are not fully elucidated. In this work, the interaction of Cs2SnCl6 and Cl-enriched solid solution Cs2SnI0.9Cl5.1 with water was systematically studied by in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction and micro-Raman spectra and compared with the isostructural Cs2SnI6. Unlike Cs2SnI6, which experiences a direct dissolution in water, Cs2SnCl6 displays an enhanced stability and the dissolution of the Cs2SnCl6 accompanies with the formation of an amorphous alteration phase. Under controlled dehydration conditions, two-dimensional Cs2SnCl6 flakes can be precipitated out from water solution. Furthermore, the mixed halide perovskite (Cs2SnI0.9Cl5.1) experiences fast iodide dissolution in water solution and transforms to a more chloride-enriched perovskite which shows a behavior similar to Cs2SnCl6. The mechanistic understanding of the dissolution-precipitation process of Cs2SnIxCl6-x perovskites is useful for developing new perovskites with varied halogen and controlled environmental stability.

Although many passivation molecules have been reported, it remains very unclear regarding the passivation mechanisms of various functional groups. Here, we systematically engineer the structures of passivation molecular functional groups, including carboxyl, amine, isopropyl, phenethyl, and tert-butylphenethyl groups, and study their passivation capability to perovskites. It reveals the carboxyl and amine groups would heal charged defects via electrostatic interactions, and the neutral iodine related defects can be reduced by the aromatic structures. The judicious control of the interaction between perovskite and molecules can further realize grain boundary passivation, including those that are deep toward substrates. Understanding of the underlining mechanisms allows us to design a new passivation molecule, D-4-tert-butylphenylalanine, yielding high-performance p-i-structure solar cells with a stabilized efficiency of 21.4%. The open-circuit voltage (V-OC) of a device with an optical bandgap of 1.57 eV for the perovskite layer reaches 1.23 V, corresponding to a record small V-OC deficit of 0.34 V. Our findings provide a guidance for future design of new passivation molecules to realize multiple facets applications in perovskite electronics.

Superoxide/Peroxide Chemistry Extends Charge Carriers' Lifetime but Undermines Chemical Stability of CH3NH3PbI3 Exposed to Oxygen: Time-Domain ab Initio Analysis	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							ELECTRON-HOLE RECOMBINATION; METHYLAMMONIUM LEAD IODIDE; DONOR-ACCEPTOR INTERACTION; PEROVSKITE SOLAR-CELLS; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; HYBRID PEROVSKITE; PYXAID PROGRAM; QUANTUM DOTS	Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites have emerged as very successful optically active materials due to their unique electronic and chemical properties. Experiments have shown that oxygen undermines perovskite chemical stability, but enhances charge carrier lifetimes. Focusing on CH3NH3PbI3, which has become the classic material, we demonstrate how and why charge carrier lifetimes change in the presence of oxygen, by carrying out nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations combined with time-domain ab initio density functional theory. Calculations have shown that superoxide and peroxide are the common forms of oxygen interacting with CH3NH3PbI3 and that oxygen most readily interacts with iodine vacancies on the perovskite surface. We establish that the iodine vacancy decreases charge carrier lifetimes, because it localizes both electrons and holes, increasing their overlap. By passivating the vacancy, the oxygen species separate electrons and holes and increase the lifetimes by more than an order of magnitude. Passivating the vacancy by water and Lewis bases, such as pyridine and thiophene, also leads to electron-hole separation. The energy gap changes only by a few percent; however, the nonadiabatic coupling becomes much weaker, and the quantum coherence time decreases significantly. The detailed time-domain atomistic analysis of the excited state dynamics rationalizes why the photogenerated charge carriers in perovskites are robust to defects and interactions with chemical species present in air, such as water and oxygen, even though they undermine perovskite chemical stability. The results can apply to other solar energy materials, which are exposed to atmospheric gases and the performance of which often depends on such exposure.

However, the bulky spacer cations often limit charge transport. Here, we report on a simple approach based on molecular design of the organic spacer to improve the transport properties of 2D perovskites, and we use phenethylammonium (PEA) as an example. We demonstrate that by fluorine substitution on the para position in PEA to form 4-fluorophenethylammonium (F-PEA), the average phenyl ring centroid-centroid distances in the organic layer become shorter with better aligned stacking of perovskite sheets. The impact is enhanced orbital interactions and charge transport across adjacent inorganic layers as well as increased carrier lifetime and reduced trap density. Using a simple perovskite deposition at room temperature without using any additives, we obtained a power conversion efficiency of >13% for (F-PEA)(2)MA(4)Pb(5)I(16)-based PSCs. In addition, the thermal stability of 2D PSCs based on F-PEA is significantly enhanced compared to those based on PEA.

From OD Cs3Bi2I9 to 2D Cs3Bi2I6Cl3: Dimensional Expansion Induces a Direct Band Gap but Enhances Electron Phonon Coupling	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							WHITE-LIGHT EMISSION; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; SOLAR-CELLS; RB; BI; BR; A(3)M(2)I(9); ABSORPTION; TRANSPORT; PHASE	Alternative all-inorganic halide perovskites are sought to replace the hybrid lead halide perovskites because of their increased stability. Here, the (111)-oriented defect perovskite family A(3)M(2)X(9) based on trivalent M3(+) is expanded through the use of mixed halides, resulting in Cs3Bi2I6Cl3. This compound shares the (111)-oriented 2D bilayer structure of alpha-Cs3Sb2I9 (space group P (3) over bar m1), with Cl occupying the bridging positions of the bilayers and I in the terminal sites, in contrast to the parent compound Cs3Bi2I9, which consists of 0D molecular [Bi2I9](3) dimers. The increased dimensionality induces a direct band gap as calculated by density functional theory but has an absorption edge of 2.07 eV, nearly identical to the indirect band gap compound Cs3Bi2I9. Intriguingly, there is a remarkable lack of Cl orbital contribution to the band edge states of Cs3Bi2I6Cl3, despite BiCl bonds binding all octahedra together. This highlights the importance of interlayer interactions in the defect perovskite family, which enhances the effective dimensionality of these 2D and 0D materials and may improve their optoelectronic performance. However, these changes in the excitonic absorption do not reflect free excitons, as Cs3Bi2I6Cl3 exhibits broad photoluminescence as a result of self-trapped excitons, which appear to be universal in the (111)-oriented defect perovskites.

In Situ Back-Contact Passivation Improves Photovoltage and Fill Factor in Perovskite Solar Cells	ADVANCED MATERIALS			English	Article						band alignment; passivation; perovskite solar cells; semiconducting polymers	HIGHLY EFFICIENT; STABILITY; RECOMBINATION; INTERFACE	Organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have seen a rapid rise in power conversion efficiencies in recent years; however, they still suffer from interfacial recombination and charge extraction losses at interfaces between the perovskite absorber and the charge-transport layers. Here, in situ back-contact passivation (BCP) that reduces interfacial and extraction losses between the perovskite absorber and the hole transport layer (HTL) is reported. A thin layer of nondoped semiconducting polymer at the perovskite/HTL interface is introduced and it is shown that the use of the semiconductor polymer permitsin contrast with previously studied insulator-based passivantsthe use of a relatively thick passivating layer. It is shown that a flat-band alignment between the perovskite and polymer passivation layers achieves a high photovoltage and fill factor: the resultant BCP enables a photovoltage of 1.15 V and a fill factor of 83% in 1.53 eV bandgap PSCs, leading to an efficiency of 21.6% in planar solar cells.

A Conical Intersection Perspective on the Low Nonradiative Recombination Rate in Lead Halide Perovskites	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							ELECTRON-HOLE RECOMBINATION; 2ND-ORDER PERTURBATION-THEORY; CONFIGURATION-INTERACTION; BASIS-SETS; SCF METHOD; EFFICIENT; PSEUDOPOTENTIALS; DYNAMICS; PHASE; CCSD	The utility of optoelectronic materials can be greatly reduced by the presence of efficient pathways for nonradiative recombination (NRR). Lead halide perovskites have garnered much attention in recent years as materials for solar energy conversion, because they readily absorb visible light, are easy to synthesize, and have a low propensity for NRR. Here we report a theoretical study of the pathways for NRR in an archetypal lead halide perovskite: CsPbBr3. Specifically, we identified a set of conical intersection (CIs) in both a molecule-sized cluster model (Cs4PbBr6) and nanoparticle model (Cs(12)pb(4) Br-20) of the CsPbBr3 surface. The energies of the minimal energy CIs, corrected for both dynamical electron correlation and spin-orbit coupling, are well above the bulk band gap of CsPbBr3, suggesting that these intersections do not provide efficient pathways for NRR in this material. Analysis of the electronic structure at these intersections suggests that the ionic nature of the bonds in CsPbBr3 may play a role in the high energy of these CIs. The lowest-energy intersections all involve charge transfer over long distances, whether it be across a dissociated bond or between neighboring unit cells.

Symmetry Breaking at MAPbI(3) Perovskite Grain Boundaries Suppresses Charge Recombination: Time-Domain ab Initio Analysis	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; ORGANIC CATION; PHOTOCURRENT SPECTROSCOPY; TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE; CH3NH3PBI3 PEROVSKITE; PYXAID PROGRAM; BAND-GAP; PERFORMANCE; ENERGY	The influence of grain boundaries (GBs) on charge carrier lifetimes in methylammonium lead triiodide perovskite (MAPbI(3)) remains unclear. Some experiments suggest that GBs promote rapid nonradiative decay and deteriorate device performance, while other measurements indicate that charge recombination happens primarily in non-GB regions and that GBs facilitate charge separation and collection. By combining time-domain density functional theory and nonadiabatic (NA) molecular dynamics, we demonstrate that charge separation and localization happening at MAPbI(3) GBs due to symmetry breaking suppresses charge recombination. Even though GBs lower the MAPbI(3) bandgap and charge localization enhances interactions with phonons, electron-hole separation decreases the NA coupling, and the excited state lifetime remains virtually unchanged compared to the pristine perovskite. Our study rationalizes how GBs can have a positive influence on perovskite optoelectronic properties and advances fundamental understanding of charge carrier dynamics in these fascinating materials.

These so-called intrinsic magnetic field effects (MFEs) can be observed in linear and non-linear regimes under one-photon and two-photon excitations in both low- and high-orbital materials. On the other hand, spin injection can be realized to influence spin-dependent excited states and electrical conduction via organic/ferromagnetic hybrid interface, leading to extrinsic MFEs. In last decades, MFEs have been serving as a unique experimental tool to reveal spin-dependent processes in excited states, electrical transport, and polarization in light-emitting diodes, solar cells, memories, field-effect transistors, and lasing devices. Very recently, they provide critical understanding on the operating mechanisms in advanced organic optoelectronic materials such as thermally activated delayed fluorescence light-emitting materials, non-fullerene photovoltaic bulk-heterojunctions, and organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites. While MFEs were initially realized by operating spin states in organic semiconducting materials with delocalized pi electrons under negligible orbital momentum, recent studies indicate that MFEs can also be achieved under strong orbital momentum and Rashba effect in light emission, photovoltaics, and dielectric polarization. The transition of MFEs from the spin regime to the orbital regime creates new opportunities to versatilely control light-emitting, photovoltaic, lasing, and dielectric properties by using long-range Coulomb and short-range spin-spin interactions between orbitals. This article reviews recent progress on MFEs with the focus on elucidating fundamental mechanisms to control optical, electrical, optoelectronic, and polarization behaviors via spin-dependent excited states, electrical transport, and dielectric polarization. In this article both representative experimental results and mainstream theoretical models are presented to understand MFEs in the spin and orbital regimes for organic materials, nanoparticles, and organic-inorganic hybrids under linear and non-linear excitation regimes with emphasis on underlying spin-dependent processes.

Uniaxial Expansion of the 2D Ruddlesden-Popper Perovskite Family for Improved Environmental Stability	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							LEAD IODIDE PEROVSKITES; SOLAR-CELLS; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; HYBRIDS (CNH2N+1NH3)(2)PBI4; HIGH-EFFICIENCY; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; CATIONS; SINGLE; DIMENSIONALITY	The unique hybrid nature of 2D Ruddlesden-Popper (R-P) perovskites has bestowed upon them not only tunability of their electronic properties but also high-performance electronic devices with improved environmental stability as compared to their 3D analogs. However, there is limited information about their inherent heat, light, and air stability and how different parameters such as the inorganic layer number and length of organic spacer molecule affect stability. To gain deeper understanding on the matter we have expanded the family of 2D R-P perovskites, by utilizing pentylamine (PA)(2)(MA)(n-1)PbnI3n+1 (n = 1-5, PA = CH (3) (CH (2) ) (4) NH (+)(3), C 5) and hexylamine (HA)(2)(MA)(n-1)PbnI3n+1 (n = 1-4, HA = CH3(CH2)(5)NH3+, C6) as the organic spacer molecules between the inorganic slabs, creating two new series of layered materials, for up to n = 5 and 4 layers, respectively. The resulting compounds were extensively characterized through a combination of physical and spectroscopic methods, including single crystal X-ray analysis. High resolution powder X-ray diffraction studies using synchrotron radiation shed light for the first time to the phase transitions of the higher layer 2D R-P perovskites. The increase in the length of the organic spacer molecules did not affect their optical properties; however, it has a pronounced effect on the air, heat, and light stability of the fabricated thin films. An extensive study of heat, light, and air stability with and without encapsulation revealed that specific compounds can be air stable (relative humidity (RH) = 20-80% +/- 5%) for more than 450 days, while heat and light stability in air can be exponentially increased by encapsulating the corresponding films. Evaluation of the out-of-plane mechanical properties of the corresponding materials showed that their soft and flexible nature can be compared to current commercially available polymer substrates (e.g., PMMA), rendering them suitable for fabricating flexible and wearable electronic devices.

Perovskite materials have been attracting ever-increasing attention owing to their large absorption coefficient, tunable bandgap, low cost, and easy fabrication process. With their rapidly increased power conversion efficiency, organic-inorganic metal halide perovskite-based solar cells have demonstrated themselves as the most promising candidates for next-generation photovoltaic applications. In fact, it is a dream come true for researchers to finally find a perfect top-cell candidate in tandem device design in commercially developed solar cells like single-crystalline silicon and CIGS cells used as the bottom component cells. Here, the recent progress of multijunction solar cells is reviewed, including perovskite/silicon, perovskite/CIGS, perovskite/perovskite, and perovskite/polymer multijunction cells. In addition, some perspectives on using these solar cells in emerging markets such as in portable devices, Internet of Things, etc., as well as an outlook for perovskite-based multijunction solar cells are discussed.

Following optical and electrochemical characterization of the open-cage fullerenes 2a-c, p-i-n PSCs with a indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/perovskite/fullerene/Ag structure were prepared. The devices obtained from 2a-b exhibit competitive power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and improved open-circuit voltage (V-oc) values (>1.0 V) in comparison to a reference cell based on phenyl-C-61-butyric-acid methyl-ester (PC61BM). These results are rationalized in terms of a) the higher passivation ability of the open-cage fullerenes with respect to the other fullerenes, and b) a good overlap between the highest occupied molecular orbital/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO/LUMO) levels of 2a-b and the conduction band of the perovskite.

Applying this "Suns-V-OC" technique to perovskite cells is problematic since the V-OC evolves with time in a way that depends on the previously applied bias (V-pre), bias light intensity, device architecture and processing route. Here, we show that the dominant recombination mechanism in two structurally similar CH3 NH3PbI3 devices containing either mesoporous Al2O3 or TiO2 layers can be identified from the signature of the transient ideality factor following application of a forward bias, V-pre to the device in the dark. The transient ideality factor is measured by monitoring the evolution of V-OC as a function of time at different light intensities. The initial values of ideality found using this technique are consistent with estimates of the ideality factor obtained from measurements of photoluminescence vs light intensity and electroluminescence vs current density. Time-dependent simulations of the measurement on modeled devices, which include the effects of mobile ionic charge, reveal that this initial value can be correlated to an existing zero-dimensional model while steady-state values must be analyzed taking into account the homogeneity of carrier populations throughout the absorber layer. The analysis shows that Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination through deep traps at the charge-collection interfaces is dominant in both architectures of measured device. Using transient photovoltage measurements directly following illumination on bifacial devices, we further show that the perovskite-electron-transport-layer interface extends throughout the mesoporous TiO2 layer, consistent with a transient ideality signature corresponding to SRH recombination in the bulk of the film. This method will be useful for identifying performance bottlenecks in alternative variants of perovskite and other mixed ionic-electronic conducting absorber-based solar cells.

Series Resistance Measurements of Perovskite Solar Cells Using J(sc)-V-oc Measurements	SOLAR RRL			English	Article						fill factor; J(sc)-V-oc; perovskite; series resistance; suns-V-oc	HYSTERESIS; EFFICIENCY; LIMIT	The fill factor (FF) of perovskite solar cells is considerably lower than that of gallium arsenide and silicon cells, though they have similar open-circuit voltage deficits. To probe the FF loss, which mainly comes from series resistance, the J(sc)-V-oc characterization technique is applied to perovskite solar cells. A continuous-lamp solar simulator with an array of neutral density filters is used instead of the quasi-steady-state photoconductance technique commonly employed for silicon cells, which allows us to tune sweep parameters to accommodate the complex behavior of perovskites such as hysteresis. It is found that, for Cs(0.25)FA(0.75)Pb(Br0.2I0.8)(3) (CsFA) perovskite cells, sweeping from positive to negative voltage yields the same series resistance regardless of sweep speed, whereas this is not the case if the sweep is reversed. However, for CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite cells, the series resistance is independent of the sweep speed in both sweep directions. It is also found that, for a poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) hole contact, increasing the PTAA thickness barely changes the recombination-limited pseudo-FF, but reduces the FF due to increased series resistance. A maximum FF of 80.9% was achieved with the PTAA hole contact on a CsFA perovskite absorber.

However, controlling the phase distribution according to device architecture remains a major challenge. Here, the manipulation of phase purity and vertical distribution proven by ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, and their effect on device characteristics are reported. By adding ethyl acetate as antisolvent, the growth direction of the perovskite film is flipped. CH3NH3Cl and dimethyl sulfoxide are used to slow the growth rate of the crystal, which gives better phase purity. The direction of carrier transfer is tuned accordingly. It is found that solar cell performance is more sensitive to phase purity relative to vertical distribution. These findings are of importance for the applications of quasi-2D perovskites in different types of devices that require to change phase purity and vertical distribution.

However, further improving the PCEs of PSCs is challenged by material properties, device stability, and packaging technologies. Here, we report a new approach to increase the PCEs of flexible PSCs via introducing the piezo-phototronic effect in the PSCs by growing an array of ZnO nanowires on flexible plastic substrates, which act as the electron-transport layer for PSCs. From the piezo-phototronic effect, the absolute PCE was improved from 9.3 to 12.8% for flexible perovskite solar cells under a static mechanical strain of 1.88%, with a similar to 40% enhancement but no change in the components of materials and device structure. A corresponding working model was proposed to elucidate the strategy to boost the performance of the PSCs. These findings present a general approach to improve PCEs of flexible PSCs without changing their fundamental materials.

Water in hybrid perovskites: Bulk MAPbI(3) degradation via super-hydrous state	APL MATERIALS			English	Article							LEAD IODIDE PEROVSKITE; ORGANIC-INORGANIC PEROVSKITES; SOLAR-CELLS; AB-INITIO; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; MOISTURE STABILITY; IN-SITU; DISSOCIATIVE ADSORPTION; DEPENDENT DEGRADATION	Here, first-principles density functional theory calculations are presented which reveal how water incorporation in hybrid halide perovskite [CH3NH3]PbI3 (MAPbI(3)) catalyzes the phase transition to the ([CH3NH3]PbI3 center dot H2O edge-sharing) monohydrate (colorless) phase, eliminating its favorable photovoltaic properties. First, fundamental chemical and electrostatic interactions between water and each component of MAPbI(3) are analyzed, demonstrating their dependence on water concentration. Second, the energetics of incorporated water is explored, leading to the discovery of spontaneous phase segregation into dry regions and regions with more than one water per formula unit-termed the "super-hydrous state." Third, the properties of the super-hydrous state are analyzed, including the acceleration of octahedron breaking and rearrangement by the high water density. This reveals the phase transformation to be a bulk process, initiated at the super-hydrous regions.

Remarkable progress in device performance has been achieved for last few years. Their high performance in combination with low production cost puts the perovskite optoelectronics under serious consideration for possible commercialization. A fundamental question that remains unanswered is whether these materials can sustain their optoelectronic properties during harsh and prolonged operational conditions of the devices. A major concern stems from an unprecedented and unique feature of perovskite materials, which is migration of ionic species (or charged defects). Recent studies have indicated that the ion migration might be a limit factor for long-term operational stability of the devices. In this regard, herein we have reviewed important studies on discovery, quantification, and mitigation of the ion migration process in metal halide perovskite materials. A possible emerging application using the ion migration is also briefly introduced. (C) 2019 Author(s).

The linear Boltzmann transport equation is applied to obtain the perturbation to the electron distribution by different scattering mechanisms. The mobility is mainly limited by the deformation-potential interaction with long-wavelength acoustic vibrations at low carrier concentrations. At high concentrations, ionized impurity scattering becomes stronger. The electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient are calculated accurately over various ranges of temperature and carrier concentration. The lattice thermal conductivity of PbI2, 0.065 W m(-1) K-1 at 300 K, is the lowest among other 2D thermoelectric materials. Such ultralow thermal conductivity is attributed to large atomic mass, weak interatomic bonding, strong anharmonicity, and localized vibrations in which the vast majority of heat is trapped. These electrical and phonon transport properties enable a high thermoelectric figure of merit over 1 for both p-type and n-type doping from 300 K to 900 K. A maximum zT of 4.9 is achieved at 900 K with an electron concentration of 1.9 x 10(12) cm(-2). Our work shows exceptionally good thermoelectric energy conversion efficiency in monolayer PbI2, which can be integrated to the existing photovoltaic devices.

Conduction band alignment at the perovskite/ETL interface has been suggested to be an important role for the performance of the solar cells. However, little is known about the effects of work-function shifts on the solar-cell performance, and specifically, the open-circuit voltage (V-OC). Here, the effects of surface modification of SnO2 ETLs using polar phosphonic acids are investigated, including the effects on work function, surface energy, device performance, and device stability in inert atmosphere. The phosphonic acid modifications did not have a large effect on V-OC; however, a sharp decrease in the overall device performance was found, mostly due to reduced fill factors. When exposed to conditions of low oxygen concentration, the phosphonic acid surface modified devices yielded current-voltage (J-V) curves with considerably lower hysteresis than those based on unmodified SnO2. This suggests that this modification method may be valuable for achieving stabilized power conversion efficiency without hysteresis.	[Hill, Rebecca B.

While the normal-type devices exhibited a high power conversion efficiency of 20.2%, their reproducibility was limited. On the other hand, the inverted-type devices exhibited an efficiency of 18.2% with a greater stability and higher reproducibility than those of the normal-type devices. The reduced reproducibility of the normal-type devices was associated with the crack formation on the perovskite films during a spin-coating process. The hardness of both the perovskite and the sublayer was directly linked to the crack formation. Inverted-type 2D/3D FACsPbI(3) with ozone-treated poly(triarylamine) as sublayer exhibited the highest phase stability owing to the hydrophobic nature of poly(triarylamine) and improved energy level alignment upon an ozone treatment. In addition, strong interaction between phenethylamine cations of the 2D perovskite and of the 3D FACsPbI(3) crystal at grain boundaries contributed to the high phase stability.

Complete Suppression of Detrimental Polymorph Transitions in All-Inorganic Perovskites via Nanoconfinement	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						all-inorganic perovskites; nanoconfinement; polymorph phase transition; stability; photophysics	CESIUM LEAD IODIDE; QUANTUM DOTS; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; SOLAR-CELLS; PHASE; PHOTOLUMINESCENCE; CRYSTALLIZATION; EFFICIENT; ALPHA-CSPBI3	Reducing the size of metal halide perovskite crystals to the nanoscale has been demonstrated to stabilize high-performance metastable polymorphs at room temperature. Cesium lead iodide (CsPbI3), for example, typically exists as the insulating delta-phase at room temperature but can adopt the narrow-bandgap gamma-phase when the crystal size is reduced to the nanometer length scale. Here we advance a fundamental understanding of the role of nanoconfinement in CsPbI3 polymorph stabilization through a combination of X-ray diffraction and temperature-dependent photoluminescence. Using a wet annealing method to directly form gamma-CsPbI3 from solution in the cylindrical nanopores of anodized aluminum oxide, we discovered that nanoconfinement lowers the delta-gamma solid-state phase transition temperature from 448 K in the bulk to 370 K. Once formed, nanoconfined gamma-CsPbI3 crystals were found to be stable across the temperature range of 4-610 K and upon an unprecedented one year of air exposure at room temperature. Taking advantage of the nanoconfinement-induced suppression of phase transitions, we report for the first time a detailed analysis of electron- phonon interactions in gamma-CsPbI3 via temperature-dependent photoluminescent measurements. In-depth analysis of the temperature-dependent peak broadening revealed electron-phonon interactions to be dominated by Frohlich scattering, similar to that observed in inorganic-organic hybrid perovskite systems. Photoluminescence mapping further confirmed that nanoconfined gamma-CsPbI3 crystals exhibit spatial uniformity on the tens of micrometers length scale, suggesting nanoconfinement as a promising strategy to form stable, high-performance perovskite films from solution for light-emitting and light-harvesting applications.

Insights into operational stability and processing of halide perovskite active layers	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							HIGH-EFFICIENCY; PHASE SEGREGATION; SOLAR-CELLS; FORMAMIDINIUM; PERFORMANCE; CATIONS; MANAGEMENT	Rapid improvement of the stability of metal halide perovskite materials is required to enable their adoption for energy production at terawatt scale. To understand the role of the active layer stability in these devices we use in situ X-ray diffraction to observe the evolution in structural stability across mixed A-site APbI(3) materials where the A-site is a combination of formamidinium, Cs, and/or methylammonium. During device operation we observe spatial de-mixing and phase segregation into more pure constituent phases. Using complementary first-principles calculations of mixed A-site halide perovskites, a hypothesized framework explaining the experimentally observed mixing and de-mixing in these systems is presented and then validated using in situ X-ray diffraction and spatially resolved time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. Taken together, these results indicate that stability is not only a function of device architecture or chemical formulation, but that the processing strategy is critically important in synthesizing the most energetically favorable state and therefore the most stable device systems. This study reconciles disparate reports within the literature and also highlights the limitations of shelf life studies to ascertain stability as well as the importance of testing devices under operational conditions.

Currently, such understanding is limited, restricting the power conversion efficiencies of OMHP solar cells from reaching their Shockley-Queisser limit. In more mature semiconductors like Si, the knowledge of defects is one of the major factors in successful technological implementation. This knowledge and its control can make a paradigm shift in the development of OMHP devices. Here, we report on deep level (DL) defects and their effect on the free charge transport properties of the single crystalline methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr(3)) perovskite. To determine DL activation energy and capture cross section, we used photo-Hall effect spectroscopy (PHES) with enhanced illumination in both steady-state and dynamic regimes. This method has shown to be convenient due to the direct DL visualization by sub-bandgap photo-excitation of trapped carriers. DLs with activation energies of E-V + 1.05 eV, E-V + 1.5 eV, and E-V + 1.9 eV (or E-C - 1.9 eV) were detected. The hole capture cross section of sigma(h) = 4 x 10(-17) cm(2) is found using photoconductivity relaxation after sub-bandgap photo-excitation. Here, our experimental results demonstrate the existence of DL defects responsible for non-radiative recombination and their positions inside the bandgap for the first time. Additionally, the transport properties of single crystal MAPbBr(3) are investigated by Time of Flight (ToF) measurements at several biases. These measurements further confirm the increase of Hall mobility and the enhancement of hole transport produced by sub-bandgap illumination in MAPbBr(3) devices. The analysis of charge carrier transport by ToF measurements in combination with the energy of DLs identified by PHES can explain the long hole carrier lifetime in MAPbBr(3) devices, while the electron carrier lifetime is largely affected by trap-assisted recombination. Here, our studies provide strong evidence for deep levels in OMHPs and open a richer picture of the role and properties of deep levels in MAPbBr(3) single crystals as a system model for the first time. The deeper knowledge of the electronic structure of OMHPs could open further opportunities in the development of more feasible technologies. Indeed, knowledge of the exact positions of DLs is beneficial in controlling these defects by crystal growth modification to eliminate these defects as was done for classical inorganic semiconductors, for example, in Si, GaAs, and CdTe development.

Triplet-Sensitization by Lead Halide Perovskite Thin Films for Near-Infrared-to- Visible Upconversion	ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							ENERGY-TRANSFER; SOLAR-CELLS; RECOMBINATION DYNAMICS; CHARGE-TRANSFER; EXCITON; EFFICIENCY; CH3NH3PBI3; PHOTOVOLTAICS; NANOCRYSTALS; ANNIHILATION	Lead halide-based perovskite thin films have attracted great attention due to the rapid increase in perovskite solar cell efficiencies. The same optoelectronic properties that make perovskites ideal absorber materials in solar cells are also beneficial in other light-harvesting applications and make them prime candidates as triplet sensitizers in upconversion via triplet-triplet annihilation in rubrene. In this contribution, we take advantage of long carrier lifetimes and carrier diffusion lengths in perovskite thin films, their high absorption cross-sections throughout the visible spectrum, and the strong spin-orbit coupling owing to the abundance of heavy atoms to sensitize the upconverter rubrene. Employing bulk perovskite thin films as the absorber layer and spin-mixer in inorganic/organic heterojunction upconversion devices allows us to forego the passivating ligands required for colloidal sensitizers, which can hinder exciton transport through large scale arrays and reduce the triplet transfer efficiency to the annihilator. Our bilayer device exhibits an upconversion efficiency in excess of 3% under 785 nm illumination at an incident power of similar to 88 W/cm(2).

However, its poor conductivity, a shallow work function, and nonreflective nature have limited further enhancement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of top CNT electrode-based perovskite solar cells. Here, we introduced a simple and scalable method to address these issues by utilizing an ex-situ vapor-assisted doping method. Trifluoromethane-sulfonic acid (TFMS) vapor doping of the free-standing CNT sheet enabled tuning of conductivity and work function of the CNT electrode without damaging underneath layers. The sheet resistance of the CNT sheet was decreased by 21.3% with an increase in work function from 4.75 to 4.96 eV upon doping of TFMS. In addition, recently developed 2D perovskite-protected Cs-containing formamidium lead iodide (FACsPbI(3)) technology was employed to maximize the absorption. Because of the lowered resistance, better energy alignment, and improved absorption, the CNT electrode-based PSCs produced a PCE of 17.6% with a J(SC) of 24.21 mA/cm(2), V-OC of 1.005 V, and FF of 0.72. Furthermore, the resulting TFMS-doped CNT-PSCs demonstrated higher thermal and operational stability than bare CNT and metal electrode-based devices.

The resultant PQDs are characterized by means of XRD, TEM, Raman spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, UV/Vis, photoluminescence (PL), time-resolved PL, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). PA chain length is shown to control the PQD size (ca. 2.9-4.2 nm) and excitonic absorption band positions (lambda=488-525 nm), with shorter chain lengths corresponding to smaller sizes and bluer absorptions. All samples show a high PL quantum yield (ca. 46-83 %) and high PL stability; this is indicative of a low density of band gap trap states and effective surface passivation. Stability is higher for smaller PQDs; this is attributed to better passivation due to better solubility and less steric hindrance of the shorter PA ligands. Based on the FTIR, Raman, and XPS results, it is proposed that Pb2+ and CH3NH3+ surface defects are passivated by R-PO32- or R-PO2(OH)(-), whereas Br- surface defects are passivated by R-NH3+ moieties. This study establishes the combination of PA and APTES ligands as a highly effective dual passivation system for the synergistic passivation of multiple surface defects of PQDs through primarily ionic bonding.

Recently, mixed-cation double perovskite halides, also known as elpasolites, were proposed as an alternative lead-free candidate for the design of nontoxic perovskite solar cells. Herein, we report a new nontoxic and air stable lead-free all-inorganic semiconductor Rb4Ag2BiBr9 prepared using the mixed cation approach; however, Rb4Ag2BiBr9 adopts a new structure type (Pearson's code oP32) featuring BiBr6 octahedra and AgBr5 square pyramids that share common edges and corners to form a unique 2D layered non-perovskite structure. Rb4Ag2BiBr9 is also demonstrated to be thermally stable with the measured onset decomposition temperature of T-o = 520 degrees C. Optical absorption measurements and density functional theory calculations suggest a nearly direct band gap for Rb4Ag2BiBr9. Room temperature photoluminescence (PL) measurements show a broadband weak emission. Further, temperature-dependent and power-dependent PL measurements show a strong competition between multiple emission centers and suggest the coexistence of defect-bound excitons and self-trapped excitons in Rb4Ag2BiBr9.

However, generally, fabrication of conducive metal oxide thin films requires high temperature annealing which is not compatible with roll to roll fabrication. It has been observed that a low temperature fabricated pristine metal oxide film exhibited low electrical conductivity, which has still prohibited to achieve high performance of device. Therefore, a low amount of metal doping within the pristine metal oxide films followed by low temperature thermal annealing is an effective approach to improve the electrical properties of the metal oxide thin films, and, thus, leading the higher performance of PSCs. Herein, we have developed a low temperature (180 degrees C) solution processed Molybdenum (Mo) doped SnO2 (SnO2 :Mo) as an efficient electron transport layer (ETL) for the fabrication of planer PSCs. The electrical conductivity of pristine film was significantly enhanced after the incorporation of a small amount of Mo dopant within the neat SnO2 film, which could facilitate fast transportation of photo-generated charge carriers. Moreover, due to n-type Mo doping, Fermi level of resulting film was slightly shifted upwards, which could diminish charge recombination and, hence, improved the photovoltaic performance. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) for pristine SnO2 and SnO2 :Mo based PSCs was found to be 8.47% and 10.52%, respectively, when ETL and perovskite absorber films were processed in ambient conditions with the relative humidity range of 65%-75%. Compared to pristine SnO2 , SnO2 :Mo based PSC exhibited higher performance, which was attributed to the enhanced electrical properties of the resulting doped ETL thin film. Our results indicated that low temperature (180 degrees C) solution processed SnO2 :Mo is a promising ETL for cost effective roll to roll fabrication of PSC.

In this report, we use the change in fluorescence brightness to image the transformation of individual lead bromide (PbBr2) nanocrystals to methylammonium lead bromide (CH3NH3PbBr3) via intercalation of CH3NH3Br. Analyzing this reaction one nanocrystal at a time reveals information that is masked when the fluorescence intensity is averaged over many particles. Sharp rises in the intensity of single nanocrystals indicate they transform much faster than the time it takes for the ensemble average to transform. While the ensemble reaction rate increases with increasing CH3NH3Br concentration, the intensity rises for individual nanocrystals are insensitive to the CH3NH3Br concentration. To explain these observations, we propose a phase-transformation model in which the reconstructive transitions necessary to convert a PbBr2 nanocrystal into CH3NH3PbBr3 initially create a high energy barrier for ion intercalation. A critical point in the transformation occurs when the crystal adopts the perovskite phase, at which point the activation energy for further ion intercalation becomes progressively smaller. Monte Carlo simulations that incorporate this change in activation barrier into the likelihood of reaction events reproduce key experimental observations for the intensity trajectories of individual particles. The insights gained from this study may be used to further control the crystallization of CH3NH3PbBr3 and other solution-processed semiconductors.

Vibrational Probe of the Structural Origins of Slow Recombination in Halide Perovskites	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							CHARGE-CARRIER MOBILITIES; REAL-TIME OBSERVATION; BIMOLECULAR RECOMBINATION; ORGANIC CATION; LANGEVIN RECOMBINATION; HYBRID PEROVSKITES; SOLAR-CELLS; THIN-FILMS; DYNAMICS; DIFFUSION	We use time-resolved vibrational spectroscopy to probe the structural origins of the remarkably long charge recombination lifetimes of halide perovskites. The N-H bend vibrational mode of CH3NH3+ organic cations is coupled to the inorganic perovskite lattice and provides a means to examine the structural fluctuations of the crystalline lattice of CH3NH3PbI3 films. In the excited electronic state, the photogeneration of charge carriers the N-H bend vibrational dephasing dynamics to become very sensitive to temperature, revealing large changes in the amplitude of the structural motions of the lattice within a narrow 150-300 K temperature range of the tetragonal phase. The larger amplitude fluctuations of the lattice at elevated temperatures inhibit delocalization of photogenerated charges, causing them to self-trap into large polarons with delocalization lengths that decrease more than 30% as the temperature increases from 150 to 300 K. This self-trapping into large polarons introduces energetic barriers that decrease the capture cross section for electron/hole recombination by an order of magnitude at elevated temperatures. These findings indicate that the slow charge recombination kinetics of halide perovskites underpinning many of their remarkable properties are traced to the formation of energetic barriers that hinder wavefunction overlap of oppositely charged carriers in large polaron states. The findings also suggest that substitution of differently sized ions in halide perovskites can be used to tune the balance of charge transport versus charge recombination for photovoltaic or light-emitting applications because ions influence the structural flexibility and therefore the self-trapping of charge carriers into large polarons.

The ultraviolet (UV) part in sunlight could induce oxygen vacancy in the mesoporous TiO2 (m-TiO2) layer, resulting in the degradation of perovskite photoactive films and the rapidly decreased device performance. In this work, we demonstrate that an effective luminescent downconversion material, Eu(TTA)(2)(Phen)MAA (ETPM), can be used as an interfacial modifier between the m-TiO2 layer and the perovskite photoactive layer to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 17.00 to 19.07%. The improved device performance can be ascribed to the effective utilization of incident UV light and reduced carrier recombination. Meanwhile, the conversion of the UV light by ETPM could inhibit the stability loss of the device under irradiation. As a result, the modified PSCs can maintain 86% of their initial value under continuous light soaking for 100 h, higher than that of 40% for the control device. This work indicates that the introduction of the luminescent downconversion material ETPM can successfully improve the PCE and photostability of PSCs.

We propose two parallel reaction pathways initiated by this proton transfer. Using DMSO-d(6) to elucidate reaction schemes, we demonstrate that protonation is followed either by methyl group transfer between the resulting CH3NH2 and residual CH3NH3+, or by transmethylation to CH3NH2 from DMSOH+. The former reaction yields NH4+ and (CH3)(2)NH2+ and is the dominant pathway at processing relevant temperatures; the latter yields (CH3)(2)NH2+ in addition to methylsulfonic acid and dimethylsulfide. In the preparation of hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite (HOIP) thin films for photovoltaic applications, the substitution of CH3NH3+ with NH4+ and (CH3)(2)NH2+ in the HOIP crystal results in deviations from the tetragonal structure expected of phase-pure CH3NH3PbI3, with a deleterious effect on the absorptivity of the resulting films. These results emphasize the importance of elucidating the under-appreciated precursor/solvent reactivity, the products of which, when incorporated into the solid state, can have profound effects on HOIP composition and structure, with a commensurate impact on macroscopic properties and device performance.

At this juncture, power conversion efficiency and long-term stability are two important factors limiting their transition. PSCs exhibit rapid environmental degradation since the perovskite layer is very sensitive to factors such as humidity, temperature, and ultraviolet light. Here, a novel successful approach is demonstrated that simultaneously improves the efficiency and stability of PSCs. This approach relies on incorporation of a dual-functional polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)-fullerene complex into the perovskite layer. The fullerene within perovskite layer forms a localized dipole-like electric field that favors electron-hole separation, resulting in significant improvement in current density and fill factor with conversion efficiency reaching 18.4%. The molecular-scale coating of hydrophobic PMMA on the perovskite grain boundary effectively blocks moisture penetration into the perovskite, thereby, significantly improving the stability against moisture, heat, and light. The PSCs with PMMA-fullerene complex showed no photovoltaic performance degradation for 250 d and exhibited 60 times higher stability compared to the state-of-the-art devices under continuous 1 sun illumination in ambient air.

The chemical structures of perovskite materials can be generally described by the formula of ABX(3), where cations occupy "A" and "B" sites and anions occupy "X" sites. Herein, we present a comprehensive theoretical study of two inorganic anti-perovskite materials, namely, BiNCa3 and SbNCa3, for perovskite PVs. Note that in anti-perovskites, anions occupy "A" and "B" sites, whereas cations occupy "X" sites. Specifically, for both materials, we investigate their thermodynamic stability, dynamic stability, optoelectronic properties and defect properties through ab initio calculations. Our computation suggests that both BiNCa3 and SbNCa3 possess direct band gaps of 0.65 and 1.14 eV, respectively. Notably, both predicted to be thermodynamically stable, as demonstrated by their relatively large stable region based on the phase stability analysis. Dynamic and thermal stabilities are also suggested via the computed phonon spectra and ab initio molecular dynamics simulation. Furthermore, both materials possess desired optical absorption coefficients in the visible light region, comparable to that of the prevailing organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite, MAPbI(3). Both exhibit enhanced optical absorption in the infrared region and have good defect tolerance. Lastly, good n-type and p-type conductivity may be realized by controlling the growth condition. The combined desirable properties render both BiNCa3 and SbNCa3 as promising all-inorganic and lead-free optical absorbers for PV application.

TEM-based studies hold the key to understanding the nature and functionality of these fascinating materials that are at the heart of emerging solar cells and (opto) electronic devices. While TEM-based techniques have made several groundbreaking discoveries that have resulted in astonishing advancements in the field of materials science in general over the past decades, their application to HPs has been relatively sparse. Here, we provide a perspective on TEM-based studies of HPs that have been conducted so far and project a vision for how these powerful characterization techniques can be brought to bear on research problems in the field of HPs. An outlook discussing important challenges and opportunities that lay ahead is also presented.

Chemical tuning of spacer organic cations has attracted great interest due to their additional functionalities. However, how the chemical nature of the organic cations affects the properties of two-dimensional perovskites and devices is rarely reported. Here we demonstrate that the selection of spacer cations (i.e., selective fluorination of phenethyl-ammonium) affects the film properties of two-dimensional perovskites, leading to different device performance of two-dimensional perovskite solar cells (average n = 4). Structural analysis reveals that different packing arrangements and orientational disorder of the spacer cations result in orientational degeneracy and different formation energies, largely explaining the difference in film properties. This work provides key missing information on how spacer cations exert influence on desirable electronic properties and device performance of twodimensional perovskites via the weak and cooperative interactions of these cations in the crystal lattice.

Acquired optical characterization indicates that integration of noble metal nanoparticles with cuprum-chalcogenide could heighten light absorption within visible-band due to localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) generated by Au, and the forbidden gap of nanocomposites gets adjustment accordingly. It is demonstrated that this novel photocathode alternative with favorable conductivity can not only match the energy level within the device band structure construction, but also restrain recombination so that accelerate charge transfer and extraction occurring on the photocathode. The photocurrent and photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of cells conjugating CZTS-Au photocathodes turn to be respectively 43% and 25% higher than those using pure CZTS. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that CZTS-Au, coupling very well with inorganic perovskite, owns comparable electrocatalytic performance and even higher output photocurrent with respect to platinum CEs, which portends a potential substitution for conventional costly photocathodes. A comprehensive analysis on impedance spectroscopy data is subsequently carried out for the sake of deep understanding charge accumulation and transfer response at CsSnI2.95F0.05/CE interface, attempting to orient further optimization of device performance.
