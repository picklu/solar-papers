Accordingly, heating up of electronics has become a critical problem that needs to be urgently solved by efficient and reliable thermal management. Electronic device substrates made of cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) exhibit outstanding flexibility, mechanical properties, and optical properties. Combining CNFs with high-thermal-conductivly fillers is an effective thermal management technique. This paper focuses on the thermal management of electronic devices and highlights the potential of CNF-based materials for efficient thermal management of energy storage electronic such as supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries and solar cells. A high-thermal-conductivity composite material for electronic devices can be obtained by combining CNFs as the framework material with carbon nanotubes, graphene, and inorganic nitrides. Moreover, The research progress in the application of CNFs-based materials for supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries and solar cells is highlighted, and the emerging challenges of different CNFs-based energy storage devices are discussed.

The potential for grid defection of small and medium sized enterprises using solar photovoltaic, battery and generator hybrid systems	RENEWABLE ENERGY			English	Article						Photovoltaic; Hybrid system; Battery; Grid defection; Autoproduction; Captive power	CLIMATE-CHANGE; LEARNING-CURVE; ENERGY-SYSTEMS; NUCLEAR-POWER; RESIDENTIAL SOLAR; DISPATCH STRATEGY; LEVELIZED COST; STORAGE; EXTERNALITIES; PERFORMANCE	Grid-tied solar photovoltaic (PV) systems enable lowercost electricity for small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) than current many providers of grid electricity in the U.S. These economic realities threaten conventional electric utilities, which have begun manipulating rate structures to reduce the profitability of distributed generation (DG), as well as putting arbitrary caps on DG in their service territories. SMEs may still reduce electricity costs, if they can grid defect with hybrid captive power systems made up of solar PV, battery and generator subsystems. This paper analyzes the technical and economic viability for hybrid solar systems deployed in the commercial sector to enable self-generation. Specifically, for the first time, the economics of grid defection are analyzed for three case studies of SMEs in the northern U.S., which represent a challenging technical case because of long dark winters, but also have high utility costs. The results of the simulations make it clear that grid defection is already viable for SMEs with the current prices for all components in the solar hybrid system. These results were consistent across scale, load-profile, and utility rate. These economic projections included no government incentives or subsidies and can thus be considered extremely conservative for the specific case studies. Policy changes are discussed for electric utilities to avoid the potential of a utility death spiral in this and similar performing locations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, energy from ambient sources is intermittent and unpredictable, which compromises the reliability of any system. Harvesting from multiple sources allows the collection of higher amounts of power, producing robust operation even in the presence of ambient variations. This paper describes the design of a fully integrated system that combines the energy delivered by four inputs. The proposed architecture applies a smart harvesting strategy based on the available power from the transducers. The two inputs with the most power are automatically selected and combined, while maximum power tracking is performed. If the other two sources still show some usable power, a two-way energy storage scheme allows their use to sustain the circuits operation. The system is fabricated in a 0.13-$\mu$m complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. Experimental results demonstrate a peak tracking efficiency of 96$\%$. The power conversion efficiency has a maximum of 87.2$\%$ at 198 $\mu$W of output power and 72$\%$ at 981 mu W.

Parametric life cycle assessment for distributed combined cooling, heating and power integrated with solar energy and energy storage	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Parametric life cycle assessment; Distributed energy production; Combined cooling heat and power; Renewables; Energy storage; Integrated system; Life cycle cost	STIRLING ENGINE CHP; SYSTEMS; IMPACTS; BATTERY; CCHP; OPTIMIZATION; PERFORMANCE; EMISSIONS; PV; US	In this research, we develop a parametric life cycle assessment framework and evaluate the environmental and economic trade-offs of a distributed combined cooling, heating, and power system integrated with renewable energy and energy storage system (CCHP-RE-ESS). Also, we compare this to centralized conventional energy generation. The CCHP-RE-ESS system consists of microturbines, solar PVs, lithium-ion batteries, and other auxiliary system components. Using a parametric life cycle assessment approach, we learn the trade-offs environmental and economic impacts for various sizes of solar PVs arrays and batteries. The emission impact result from the parametric life cycle assessment is more accurate than the conventional life cycle assessment due to hourly-based simulation and parametric models for different system components. Our simulations show that the proposed system that follows the thermal load can primarily reduce the overall environmental impact as compared to the centralized conventional energy production for most building types and climate zones we studied. For example, the system can help a medium office in Atlanta reduce 46% of global warming impact, 98% of water usage, 93% of acidification impact, etc. In terms of cost, the life cycle cost of the proposed system is often higher than conventional energy generation while it is more economical for the small and large office than the medium office.

Dispatch optimization of concentrating solar power with utility-scale photovoltaics	OPTIMIZATION AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Dispatch optimization; Concentrating solar power (CSP); Photovoltaics (PV); Lithium-ion battery; Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP); CSP-PV hybrid systems; Grid integration; System analysis	ELECTRICAL ENERGY-STORAGE; BATTERY STORAGE; ECONOMIC-ANALYSIS; PV; PLANTS; SYSTEMS; OPERATION; COST; COMBINATION; GENERATION	Concentrating solar power (CSP) tower technologies capture thermal radiation from the sun utilizing a field of solar-tracking heliostats. When paired with inexpensive thermal energy storage (TES), CSP technologies can dispatch electricity during peak-market-priced hours, day or night. The cost of utility-scale photovoltaic (PV) systems has dropped significantly in the last decade, resulting in inexpensive energy production during daylight hours. The hybridization of PV and CSP with TES systems has the potential to provide continuous and stable energy production at a lower cost than a PV or CSP system alone. Hybrid systems are gaining popularity in international markets as a means to increase renewable energy portfolios across the world. Historically, CSP-PV hybrid systems have been evaluated using either monthly averages of hourly PV production or scheduling algorithms that neglect the time-of-production value of electricity in the market. To more accurately evaluate a CSP-PV-battery hybrid design, we develop a profit-maximizing mixed-integer linear program (H) that determines a dispatch schedule for the individual sub-systems with a sub-hourly time fidelity. We present the mathematical formulation of such a model and show that it is computationally expensive to solve. To improve model tractability and reduce solution times, we offer techniques that: (1) reduce the problem size, (2) tighten the linear programming relaxation of (H) via reformulation and the introduction of cuts, and (3) implement an optimization-based heuristic (that can yield initial feasible solutions for ( H) and, at any rate, yields near-optimal solutions). Applying these solution techniques results in a 79% improvement in solve time, on average, for our 48-h instances of (H); corresponding solution times for an annual model run decrease by as much as 93%, where such a run consists of solving 365 instances of (H), retaining only the first 24 h' worth of the solution, and sliding the time window forward 24 h. We present annual system metrics for two locations and two markets that inform design practices for hybrid systems and lay the groundwork for a more exhaustive policy analysis. A comparison of alternative hybrid systems to the CSP-only system demonstrates that hybrid models can almost double capacity factors while resulting in a 30% improvement related to various economic metrics.

Electrical generators using the decay heat from these radioisotopes can provide long-lasting power when other types of energy, such as solar or chemical energy, are not available. Starting from the 1960s, radioisotope generators were safely used in numerous space and terrestrial missions, and have powered systems from interstellar spacecraft to lighthouses along the arctic coast. This work reviewed the generator development and critical components that constitute a functional system. Started with a brief generator history, the paper focused on technological aspects including fuel manufacturing, energy conversion elements, thermal insulation, structural materials, prototype measurements, future improvements, and concluded with the safety aspects for both space and terrestrial applications. Radioisotope generators are one example of using nuclear energy in a peaceful way to benefit human be-ings. Plutonium fuel productions were resumed and accelerated in the United States and americium fuel research was actively sponsored by the European Space Agency. It is promis-ing that more and more high performance generators will be used in future land and space missions.

These CubeSats successfully transmitted the InSight lander's entry, descent, and landing telemetry back to Earth in near-real time, which was not possible with existing Mars orbital data relay systems. In addition to solar arrays, each MarCO CubeSat was powered by a 3S4P battery comprising 18650-size lithium-ion cells. These commercial lithium-ion cells (Panasonic NCR18650B) were screened and matched using a cell selection process that was simplified relative to larger missions, to ensure safe and reliable battery behavior at an acceptable cost.

Sensor types in HSNs are diversified, mostly by batteries or solar energy as their energy source. Energy determines their lifetime. If energy consumption of sensors can be reduced from the aspect of communication, their energy consumption can be saved and lifetime can be increased, so as to improve the benefit and efficiency of the whole network. To optimize the efficiency and consumption of HSNs, a graph theory-based model was proposed by considering nodes' connectivity power and the energy consumption of data transmission. Targeting different data volumes, two undigraph-based algorithms (PMST and DSPA) were introduced to solve the proposed optimization model. For a low data volume, the minimum spanning tree network based on PMST will be the optimal topology of an HSN. For a high data volume, the shortest path network based on DSPA will be the optimal topology. A numerical example of comprehensive traffic information acquisition at a signalized intersection was used to verify the proposed algorithms. The solution process and final optimal topologies based on the PMST and the DSPA were shown. Moreover, the energy parameters of different optimal topologies of HSNs were discussed, and it was proved that the optimal topology of an HSN is dependent on the data volume of each sensor node.

Tailoring microstructural features that control properties of these materials depends on the ability to first identify the salient features governing properties and next to alter the microstructure accordingly. Choosing robust microstructure representation is pivotal towards completing both steps. In this paper, we focus on the first step and present the methodology for extracting and quantifying a local set of microstructural features covering topology, shape and size aspects of the microstructure. We use the myriad of tools to facilitate the process of clustering the common features in a given morphology and back tracking them in the input morphology opening avenues for the morphology optimization.

Regrettably, drinking water pipeline infrastructures in the US and many other developed and developing countries are in a deteriorated state becoming increasingly prone to leakages, which are estimated to be >= 20%. Although several sensor-based leakage-monitoring systems already have been developed to address this pressing challenge, the sustainability of such monitoring systems was never cross-checked, especially in the context of monitoring large-scale water-distribution systems. This paper thoroughly studies the life-cycle aspects of a vibration-based leak-detection technique, namely leak-detection index (LDI), accounting for its cost and energy consumption. The capabilities of this new technique have been demonstrated previously through an experimental campaign. In this paper, a follow-up sustainability evaluation is conducted after conceptual prototypes are developed for the real-world deployment of this new leakage-monitoring system. Batteries and solar panels are considered options for power supply. A representative water distribution network is used for estimating the life-cycle cost and energy consumption of leakage monitoring using the proposed prototypes. The sensitivity of cost and energy consumption to data sampling rate, data transmission rate, and sensor spacing are also evaluated in this study. The results presented in this paper will be of interest to researchers working on sensor-based monitoring systems for water infrastructures and to water utility managers.

We show that the structure of Si particles subjected to MACE changes dramatically in response to changing the loading of the Ag catalyst. The use of acetic acid as a surfactant and controlled injection of AgNO3 (aq) enhanced Ag deposition. The use of acetic acid and controlled injection of H2O2 not only facilitated optimization of the etching step but also allowed us to identify a previously unobserved etching regime that we denote as low-load MACE (LL-MACE). Material produced by LL-MACE exhibits dramatically different yield and structural characteristics as compared to conventionally produced material. We demonstrate the production of Si NWs as well as mesoporous Si nanoparticles from an inexpensive metallurgical-grade Si powder. High loading of Ag (HL-MACE) generates parallel etch track pores created by the correlated motion of Ag nanoparticles. The uniform size distribution (predominantly 70-100 nm) of the Ag nanoparticles is generated dynamically during etching. The walls of these etch track pores are cleaved readily by ultrasonic agitation to form Si NWs. Low loading of Ag (LL-MACE) creates 10-50 nm Ag nanoparticles that etch in an uncorrelated (randomly directed) fashion to generate a bimodal distribution of mesoporosity peaking at similar to 4and 13-21 nm. The use of a syringe pump to deliver the oxidant (H2O2) and Ag+ is essential for increased product uniformity and yield. Different process temperatures and grades of Si produced significantly different pore size distributions. These results facilitate the production of Si NWs and mesoporous nanoparticles with high yield, low cost, and controlled properties that are suitable for applications in, e.g., lithium-ion batteries, drug delivery, as well as biomedical imaging and contrast enhancement.

Tailoring the surfaces of and interfaces between different materials is one of the surest and best studied paths to enable high-energy-density batteries and high-efficiency solar cells. Metal-halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are one of the most promising photovoltaic materials due to their unprecedented development, with their record power conversion efficiency (PCE) rocketing beyond 25% in less than 10 years. Such progress is achieved largely through the control of crystallinity and surface/interface defects. Rechargeable batteries (RBs) reversibly convert electrical and chemical potential energy through redox reactions at the interfaces between the electrodes and electrolyte. The (electro)chemical and optoelectronic compatibility between active components are essential design considerations to optimize power conversion and energy storage performance. A focused discussion and critical analysis on the formation and functions of the interfaces and interphases of the active materials in these devices is provided, and prospective strategies used to overcome current challenges are described. These strategies revolve around manipulating the chemical compositions, defects, stability, and passivation of the various interfaces of RBs and PSCs.

Although the majority of recent electricity storage system installations have a duration at rated power of up to similar to 4 h, several trends and potential applications are identified that require electricity storage with longer durations of 10 to similar to 100 h. Such a duration range lies between daily needs that can be satisfied with technologies with the cost structure of lithium-ion batteries and seasonal storage utilizing chemical storage in underground reservoirs. The economics of long-duration storage applications are considered, including contributions for both energy time shift and capacity payments and are shown to differ from the cost structure of applications well served by lithium-ion batteries, In particular, the capital cost for the energy subsystem must be substantially reduced to similar to 3 $/kWh (for a duration of similar to 100 h), similar to 7 $/kWh (for a duration of similar to 50 h), or similar to 40 $/kWh (for a duration of similar to 10 h) on a fully installed basis. Recent developments in major technology classes that may approach the targets of the long-duration electricity storage (LDES) cost framework, including electrochemical, thermal, and mechanical, are briefly reviewed, This perspective, which illustrates the importance of low-cost and high-energy-density storage media, motivates new concepts and approaches for how LDES systems could be economical and provide value to the electricity grid.

PV systems are a potential source of clean energy but they experience power intermittency and lack controllability. However, smart PV inverters provide grid-friendly functionalities that control the power output of PV systems. Power intermittency of PV systems causes major problems such as voltage fluctuations and frequency deviations in an electric power grid. Together with varying loads and other renewable distributed generations, the grid frequency and voltage become difficult to manage. A smart PV inverter allows for active power curtailment, volt-watt, and frequency-watt control systems to mitigate the voltage and frequency deviations for a smart power grid. Therefore, smart PV inverters can reduce the installation of voltage and frequency control devices in an electric power grid, which in turn can reduce installation and maintenance costs. Real-time analyses of active power curtailment, volt-watt control, frequency-watt control using smart PV inverters and their effects on voltage and frequency are presented in this paper. Power curtailment operations were executed in low and high PV penetration areas. From the experimental analyses, distributed voltage deviations can be mitigated using active power curtailment and volt-watt control systems, and the over-frequency of an electric power grid can be reduced using frequency-watt control method. Controller performances of smart PV inverters are also evaluated in this paper. The experimental analyses were executed in the Maui Advanced Solar Initiative Project.

Storage tanks are used to collect thermal energy and to supply the feed to the MD system while PV cells are connected to electric-energy storage batteries to drive the pumping. Gas tanks are used to supplement the solar thermal energy as needed. An optimization formulation is developed to determine the number and size of the storage tanks, the operating variables, the collection and dispatch times, the extent of solar and fossil-energy uses, and the operating schedule for the integrated system.

J	Zhang, TZ; Chen, TD				Zhang, Tony Z.; Chen, T. Donna			Smart charging management for shared autonomous electric vehicle fleets: A Puget Sound case study	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Shared mobility; Autonomous vehicle; Electric vehicle; Smart charging; Demand side management; Vehicle grid interaction	ENERGY; OPERATIONS; BENEFITS; STRATEGY; STORAGE; POWER	Increasingly, experts are forecasting the future of transportation to be shared, autonomous and electric. As shared autonomous electric vehicle (SAEV) fleets roll out to the market, the electricity consumed by the fleet will have significant impacts on energy demand and, in turn, drive variation in energy cost and reliability, especially if the charging is unmanaged. This research proposes a smart charging (SC) framework to identify benefits of active SAEV charging management that strategically shifts electricity demand away from high-priced peak hours or towards renewable generation periods. Time of use (TOU), real time pricing (RTP), and solar generation electricity scenarios are tested using an agent-based simulation to study (1) the impact of battery capacity and charging infrastructure type on SAEV fleet performance and operational costs under SC management; (2) the cost reduction potential of SC considering energy price fluctuation, uncertainty, and seasonal variation; (3) the charging infrastructure requirements; and (4) the system efficiency of powering SAEVs with solar generation. A case study from the Puget Sound region demonstrates the proposed SC algorithm using trip patterns from the regional travel demand model and local energy prices. Results suggest that in the absence of electricity price signals, SAEV charging demand is likely to peak the evening, when regional electricity use patterns already indicate high demand. Under SC management, EVs with larger battery sizes are more responsive to low-electricity cost charging opportunities, and have greater potential to reduce total energy related costs (electricity plus charging infrastructure) for a SAEV fleet, especially under RTP structure.

Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy of Metal Oxide Electrodes for Energy Applications	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						impedance; metal oxide; solar energy conversion; energy storage; photoelectrocatalysis	SENSITIZED SOLAR-CELLS; LITHIUM-ION BATTERY; PHOTOELECTROCHEMICAL WATER OXIDATION; OXYGEN EVOLUTION REACTION; CHARGE-TRANSPORT PROPERTIES; REDUCED GRAPHENE OXIDE; DENSITY-OF-STATES; MODULATED PHOTOCURRENT SPECTROSCOPY; MORPHOLOGY-DEPENDENT PERFORMANCE; VISIBLE-LIGHT DRIVEN	Metal oxides have been of great importance to the development of energy conversion and storage technologies including heterojunction solar cells, Li-ion batteries, and electrocatalysts/photocatalysts for water splitting and CO2 reduction. The role of metal oxides in these devices has been diverse, from charge transport layers to catalytic surfaces to protective blocking layers. Understanding the fundamental structural and electronic properties of these materials will continue to allow for advancement in the field of renewable energy. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is one of the most utilized methods to characterize these electrodes in the context of energy applications. The utility of EIS stems from its ability to differentiate multiple interfaces (i.e., solid/electrolyte, solid/solid) within devices on the basis of their frequency response to a modulated potential and the subsequent decoupling of resistive and capacitive circuit components. In this review, the fundamental theory of EIS is first described with a physical and mathematical basis, followed by a discussion of equivalent circuit modeling. The review then covers examples from the literature where EIS has been particularly important in the understanding of electronic properties related to metal oxide electrodes within energy conversion and storage devices. A specific focus is placed on metal oxides that are used as heterojunction solar cells, ion batteries, and photocatalysts/electrocatalysts. Common themes are discussed within each application such as the study of electron and hole diffusion in solar cells, the dependence of recombination reactions and catalysis on surface defect/trap states for solar cells and photocatalysts, and the formation of passivation layers at the solid electrolyte interface in Li-ion batteries.

Aggregators facilitate the participation of end-users by acting on their behalf and interacting with bulk electricity markets. In this paper, an energy management algorithm is presented to investigate the impact of distributed photovoltaic (PV) and central energy storage system (ESS) assets on the economic performance of an energy aggregator in the residential sector. To enable DR, the aggregator provides a competitive incentive price to end-users, and centrally optimizes the central ESS assets and schedule of committed customer elastic loads. Thus, customers reduce their daily electricity bill while the aggregator decreases the aggregated peak consumption and earns profits as a return for providing DR services. The scope of this paper pertains to the economic impact of distributed PV and central ESS assets on aggregator profits and customer savings resulting from DR, including ESS degradation. Simulation results showed that the central ESS increases the income of the aggregator, whereas residential PV reduces the impact of DR.

However, the poor matching of these systems can adversely affect the power conversion efficiency, safety, and cost due to increased charge control strategies and supporting load management equipment. In this work, we significantly improve the rate performance of the battery electrodes by asphalt-derived carbon coating, and strategically couple high-efficiency n-i-p type perovskite solar cells with either aqueous lithium or sodium (Li/Na)-ion batteries, for the first time, to create a low-cost and high-performance photovoltaic battery system. Both photovoltaic battery systems demonstrate stable cycling performance for at least 30 cycles. We also demonstrate a high energy-conversion and storage efficiency of about 9.3% at a high discharge rate of 2 C and show that this is significantly superior than previously integrated photovoltaic battery systems. We suggest that the enhanced power and efficient energy transfer between the perovskite solar cells and aqueous Li/Na-ion batteries make this system attractive for a wide range of energy needs.

Significant progress has been made to understand the electronic, mechanical, and optical characteristics of graphene. However, the wettability of graphene, which is important for surface modification and thermal/fluidic properties, is still not well understood. The level of transparency to van der Waals forces, chemical bonds, and electrostatic interactions between atoms and molecules on two sides of graphene single layer is partially known. Static contact angle between the edge of sessile drop and functionalized surface provides surface tension value based on Owens?Wendt model and is important for wettability studies. In this work, we investigate the surface energy of glass, silicon wafer, and plasmonic nano-hole arrays (Silver, Polymer and Gold) suspended with CVD grown and transferred single layer of graphene. Our experimental results demonstrate that graphene is wetting transparent in the case of silicon and wetting opaque when deposited on the glass. The plasmonic nanohole arrays (NHAs) fall in the partially wetting transparent category. On plasmonic NHAs, the surface energy value got reduced with the suspending single layer graphene compared to absence of graphene. These results showed that the underlying substrate does affect the wettability of graphene monolayer due to van der Waal hydrocarbon, metal-carbide, and silica-carbon bonding which tends to provide deeper understanding of the wetting dynamics. This study elucidates the mechanism of short-range forces between water-graphene-substrate which is important during the fabrication of adhesives and coatings with controlled fluidic and heating properties.

Grid integration of intermittent renewables exacerbates this problem. Energy storage can mitigate demand fluctuations. Yet, common grid-scale storage technologies are geographically limited or prohibitively expensive. Storing electricity as heat, although thermodynamically counter-intuitive, can be cheaper and nonrestrictive. To do so, high temperatures are desired according to the second law of thermodynamics. Here, we analyze electricity storage through the phase change of solid to molten silicon and discharge the stored heat radiatively to a working fluid, allowing system flexibility. We use heat transfer analyses to determine whether radiative discharge of a thermal energy storage system to supercritical water is a viable method. Our analysis shows a system cost of $45 +/- 10 per kWh(e) and 12-hr round-trip efficiency of similar to 38%-43%. Rather than constructing additional gas-fired peaker plants to address peak loads, the proposed system can be implemented and use existing infrastructure from retired coal power plants. This approach is compatible with current power plants as well as renewable energy, providing a segue from fossil fuels to renewable energy dependent power plants. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, water pollution in fish farming ponds is regarded as the leading cause of fish death and financial losses in the market. Here, an Internet of Things system based on a cubic multidimensional integration of circuit (MD-IC) is demonstrated for water and food security applications in fish farming ponds. Both faces of the silicon substrate are used for thin-film-based device fabrication. The devices are interconnected via through-silicon-vias, resulting in a bifacial complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor-compatible electronics system. The demonstrated cubic MD-IC is a complete, small, and lightweight system that can be easily deployed by farmers with no need for specialists. The system integrates on its outer sides simultaneous air and water quality monitoring devices (temperature, electrical conductivity, ammonia, and pH sensors), solar cells for energy-harvesting, and antenna for real-time data-transfer, while data-management circuitry and a solid-state battery are integrated on its internal faces. Microfluidic cooling technology is used for thermal management in the MD-IC. Finally, a biofriendly polymeric encapsulation is used to waterproof the embedded electronics, improve the mechanical robustness, and allow the system to float on the surface of the water.

J	Long, J; Buyukorturk, O				Long, James; Buyukorturk, Oral			Collaborative duty cycling strategies in energy harvesting sensor networks	COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Article; Early Access							POWER MANAGEMENT; ARCHITECTURE; DEPLOYMENT	Energy harvesting wireless sensor networks are a promising solution for low cost, long lasting civil monitoring applications. But management of energy consumption is a critical concern to ensure these systems provide maximal utility. Many common civil applications of these networks are fundamentally concerned with detecting and analyzing infrequently occurring events. To conserve energy in these situations, a subset of nodes in the network can assume active duty, listening for events of interest, while the remaining nodes enter low power sleep mode to conserve battery. However, judicious planning of the sequence of active node assignments is needed to ensure that as many nodes as possible can be reached upon the detection of an event, and that the system maintains capability in times of low energy harvesting capabilities. In this article, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) agent, which acts as a centralized power manager for this system. We develop a comprehensive simulation environment to emulate the behavior of an energy harvesting sensor network, with consideration of spatially varying energy harvesting capabilities, and wireless connectivity. We then train the proposed RL agent to learn optimal node selection strategies through interaction with the simulation environment. The behavior and performance of these strategies are tested on real unseen solar energy data, to demonstrate the efficacy of the method. The deep RL agent is shown to outperform baseline approaches on both seen and unseen data.

To achieve this goal, process models based on mass and energy balances were used to find the minimum cost of water in MD systems. Three MD configurations: direct contact, sweeping gas, and vacuum MD, were compared in terms of economic cost and energy requirements in optimized, solar-driven desalination systems constrained to produce 10 m(3) d(-1) of distillate from 3.5% or 15% salinity water. Simulation results were used to calculate the water production cost as a function of 13 decision variables, including equipment size and operational variables. Non-linear optimization was performed using the particle swarm algorithm to minimize water production costs and identify optimal values for all decision variables. Results indicate that vacuum MD outperforms alternative MD configurations both economically and energetically, desalting water at a cost of less than $15 per cubic meter of product water (both initial salt levels). The highest fraction of total cost for all configurations at each salinity level was attributed to the solar thermal collectors-approximately 25% of the total present value cost. Storing energy in any form was economically unfavorable; the optimization scheme selected the smallest battery and hot water tank size allowed. Direct contact MD consumed significantly more energy (primarily thermal) than other MD forms, leading to higher system economic costs as well.

However, electric utility support of PV generation is limited by reverse power flow into the electricity network at high penetration levels. This limits the ability to achieve Zero Net Energy (ZNE) behind individual meters and in whole communities. In parallel, district level energy systems, and Advanced Energy Communities (AEC) that include storage, offer a great prospect for integrating high levels of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) into the built environment. Optimally designing such systems to serve communities, commercial, and industrial loads, while maximizing the penetration of solar PV, has been a challenge to Distribution System Operators (DSO) and city planners. This paper proposes a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) optimization to decide the best DER portfolio, allocation, and dispatch, for an AEC that achieves ZNE and islanding while respecting electrical grid operational constraints, with a focus on distribution transformer overloads. The main strategies to avoid transformer overloads were found to be judicious sizing and siting of battery energy storage and also optimally re-distributing PV throughout the community, which increased the ability of the electric infrastructure to support a PV deployment that is 1.7 times larger than the existing transformer capacity without the need for infrastructure upgrades. This work highlights the importance of including local infrastructure capacities, such as distribution transformer constraints when developing projects that result in high renewable penetration throughout the distribution network.

The value of lost load and battery price greatly influence the island mode generation capability and the economic viability of photovoltaic + battery systems to provide energy resilience during grid outages. Photovoltaic array systems combined with battery storage are increasingly important to assure reliable and resilient power supply. It has been found that the configuration of photovoltaic + battery systems, which determines their capability of operating in island mode in response to grid outages, is impacted by multiple factors. Recent industry reports and research work have highlighted the critical role that energy storage systems will have in the coming future in the electricity sector, especially when combined with renewable energy systems. The fact that forecasts predict a sharp decline in battery price not only strengthens this role but also makes the need for extensive research in this area more important. A simulation-based optimization method is developed to investigate the effects of value of lost load and battery price on the balance between total system cost and system islanding resilience to meet customer demand during a grid outage. According to actual solar irradiation data and the load profile of a hospital, a case study is conducted in which evaluation metrics are computed and compared from both resilience and economical aspects. The underlying relationship between the changes and uncertainty of value of lost load and battery price are explored by comparing the optimal total system cost under two distinct scenarios. The results provide us with guidance and insights regarding the impact of cost-related factors on photovoltaic + battery system design to make them grid-outage resilient and economically viable. Moreover, this work illustrates the positive effect that the anticipated decline in battery price will have in enhancing the resilience and effectiveness of renewable energy systems combined with energy storage.

Techno-economic evaluation of a grid-connected microgrid system	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREEN ENERGY			English	Article						Battery storage system; grid; photovoltaic; renewable energy technologies	RENEWABLE ENERGY SYSTEM; RURAL ELECTRIFICATION; POWER-GENERATION; RELIABILITY; DESIGN; ELECTRICITY; INTEGRATION; OPTIONS	The availability of solar resources has led to the utilization of photovoltaic (PV) system for the generation of a clean electricity and reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The techno-economic assessment of a medium scale microgrid system is investigated in this work by utilizing some key performance indicators (KPIs). These KPIs are used as the benchmarks to study the economic impacts of PV in the grid-connected power system for 10 selected locations across the nine provinces of South Africa. The HOMER package is utilized in the study to obtain viable solutions that will mitigate the undesirable technical and economic issues that come up during the grid integration. The research work is carried out by utilizing the surface meteorology and solar energy data provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for assessment of the proposed microgrid system. The outcomes of the study show that the annual average daily radiation varies from 4.3 kWh/m2/day in Durban to 5.749617 kWh/m2/day in De Aar. It is deduced from the work that De Aar is the most feasible location among the 10 selected sites for the installation of PV in terms of cost of energy (COE), net present cost (NPC), net energy purchased, energy purchased, energy sold, energy charge, annual utility bill savings and revenue with the following values: 0.181 R/kWh, R 219244.90, 3676 kWh, 32979 kWh, 29303 kWh, R7942.9891, R62473.0109, and R22759.6401. The outcomes of the research work indicate that exploitation of solar resources is an efficient means of accomplishing sustainable energy development.

Smart home automation through optimizing HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) temperature set points, along with distributed energy storage, could be utilized in the process of optimizing the operation of the electric grid. Using electricity prices as decision variables to leverage electrical energy storage and flexible loads can be a valuable tool to optimize the performance of the power grid and reduce electricity costs both on the supply and demand sides. Energy demand prediction is important for proper allocation and utilization of the available resources. Manipulating energy prices to leverage storage and flexible loads through these demand prediction models is a novel idea that needs to be studied. In this paper, different models for proactive prediction of the energy demand for an entire city using different machine learning techniques are presented and compared. The results of the machine learning techniques show that the proposed nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs neural network model resulted in the most accurate predictions. These prediction models pave the way for the demand side to become an important asset for grid regulation by responding to variable price signals through battery energy storage and passive thermal energy storage using HVAC temperature set points.

Proactive Energy Optimization in Residential Buildings with Weather and Market Forecasts	PROCESSES			English	Article						dynamic optimization; energy storage; forecast; HEMS; home energy optimization; model predictive control; moving horizon estimation; solar generation; thermal modeling	MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; DEMAND RESPONSE; DATA-DRIVEN; TIME; LOAD; CLASSIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; SIMULATION; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS	This work explores the development of a home energy management system (HEMS) that uses weather and market forecasts to optimize the usage of home appliances and to manage battery usage and solar power production. A Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) application is used to find the unknown home model parameters. These parameters are then updated in a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) which optimizes and balances competing comfort and economic objectives. Combining MHE and MPC applications alleviates model complexity commonly seen in HEMS by using a lumped parameter model that is adapted to fit a high-fidelity model. Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) on/off behaviors are simulated by using Mathematical Program with Complementarity Constraints (MPCCs) and solved in near real time with a non-linear solver. Removing HVAC on/off as a discrete variable and replacing it with an MPCC reduces solve time. The results of this work indicate that energy management optimization significantly decreases energy costs and balances energy usage more effectively throughout the day. A case study for Phoenix, Arizona shows an energy reduction of 21% and a cost reduction of 40%. This simulated home contributes less to the grid peak load and therefore improves grid stability and reduces the amplitude of load-following cycles for utilities. The case study combines renewable energy, energy storage, forecasts, cooling system, variable rate electricity plan and a multi-objective function allowing for a complete home energy optimization assessment. There remain several challenges, including improved forecast models, improved computational performance to allow the algorithms to run in real time, and mixed empirical/physics-based machine-learning methods to guide the model structure.

J	Zhong, QC; Wang, YQ; Ren, BB				Zhong, Qing-Chang; Wang, Yeqin; Ren, Beibei			Connecting the Home Grid to the Public Grid Field Demonstration of Virtual Synchronous Machines	IEEE POWER ELECTRONICS MAGAZINE			English	Article						Power system stability; Inverters; Batteries; Bridge circuits; Power system reliability; Synchronization; Power distribution; Energy management		Power systems are going through a paradigm shift. More and more distributed energy resources (DERs) and loads are being connected to power systems, mostly through power electronic converters. These power electronic converters can be controlled as virtual synchronous machines (VSMs), leading to a unified interface for grid integration. As a result, all active players in a power system can take part in the regulation of system frequency and voltage in a synchronized and democratized (SYNDEM) manner, significantly simplifying system operation and improving grid stability, reliability, resiliency, security, and sustainability. This article presents a pilot smart home grid at the Llano River Field Station, Texas Tech University Center at Junction, that is built according to the SYNDEM grid architecture. The home grid consists of five DER units, including four 3-kW solar units and one 3-kW wind unit with built-in battery storage in each unit, and one energy bridge for grid connection. The energy bridge has two VSMs connected back-to-back with a common dc bus. All the units are equipped with a self-synchronized universal droop controller (SUDC) with many advanced functions, i.e., black-start, grid-forming, self-synchronization without a phase-locked-loop (PLL), voltage and frequency regulation, power sharing, and power quality control. The home grid can work with or without the public grid, with seamless mode change between grid-tied operation and islanded operation. All the functions are achieved without using a communication network; hence, potential cyberattacks can be avoided. Field operation results of the home grid are presented to demonstrate the autonomous operation of the system.

The objective was to find the lowest levelized cost of energy (LCOE), with power reliability as the constraint. A genetic algorithm was used to solve the nonlinear integer programming program. A site with brackish groundwater in Arizona, USA was selected. The capacity of the RO system was 18.93 m(3)/d (5,000 gal/d), requiring a constant power consumption of 3.95 kW. Two scenarios were considered in terms of diesel generator (DG) allowed running time. The results showed that the optimal configuration was a hybrid photovoltaic/wind/diesel/battery system with 0.56 USD/kWh and the corresponding levelized cost of water 3.84 USD/m(3), when the DG can run in any hour every day. The optimal solution was a hybrid wind/photovoltaic/battery system with 0.69 USD/kWh and 4.48 USD/m(3), when the DG can run between 9 am and 9 pm every day for noise control. Both the two LCOWs were about half of the 7.9 USD/m(3) currently paid by residents that live in the area. Sensitivity analyses showed the LCOE was fairly insensitive to photovoltaic panel tilt angle over a range for both the two configurations.

J	Pham, A; Jin, TD; Novoa, C; Qin, J				An Pham; Jin, Tongdan; Novoa, Clara; Qin, Jin			A multi-site production and microgrid planning model for net-zero energy operations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS			English	Article						Logistics electrification; Climate analytics; Production planning; Microgrid sizing; Energy prosumer	MANUFACTURING SYSTEM; UNCERTAINTY; OPTIMIZATION; DEMAND	This paper aims to address two critical questions pertaining to sustainable manufacturing operations. First, how to model and design a multi-facility, production-logistics system under product demand and energy supply uncertainty? Second, is it economically viable to achieve net-zero energy operations through renewable microgrid integration? To answer both questions, we present a joint production scheduling and microgrid sizing model to decarbonize the manufacturing, transportation and warehousing operations by harnessing onsite wind and solar energy. The integrated planning model is solved as a two-stage optimization program: first, scheduling the production to meet the uncertain demand; second, sizing and siting the microgrid systems to meet the electric load of multiple facilities. The preliminary results show that net-zero energy operation is feasible and affordable in locations where the capacity factor of wind and solar generation exceeds 0.25 and 0.45, respectively. Sensitivity analysis shows that battery system combined with solar photovoltaics is cost-effective despite the high capital cost of storage devices. Two managerial insights are also derived. First, integrating onsite renewable power is the ultimate key to realizing net-zero energy industrial operations. Second, grid-connected microgrid generation with net metering results in lower capacity investment than island operation.

While this was an important step for the global community, much work remains to be done. Based on climate change and technology scenarios developed by the International Energy Agency in the wake of the agreement, the World Bank has developed a set of projections about the amount and kind of feedstock materials that will be required to achieve these targets in the years ahead. So-called "technology minerals"-including metals like lithium and cobalt that are commonly found in rechargeable batteries, or tellurium that is used to make solar cells-figure prominently. An important aspect of the Paris Agreement is the need for the world economy to shift away from fossil fuels towards green energy networks based on stored electricity and renewable energy sources. But achieving the agreements ambitious goals will necessarily require dramatic increases in global production rates for technology minerals that are far beyond current levels. Despite the urgent need for these feedstock materials, however, the mineral supply sector is not on track to satisfy anywhere near this demand. To put the industry and its supporting institutions on a path more likely to deliver these vital materials, this paper recommends a more integrated, global, system-wide approach to managing the organizations behind technology minerals: the Smart Mineral Enterprise Development (SMED) framework.

In this method, particles are accelerated to a high velocity and then impact a substrate at near ambient temperature, where dissipation of their kinetic energy produces strong adhesion. Here, recent progress in fundamentals and applications of cold spraying is reviewed. High-velocity impact with the substrate results in significant deformation, which not only produces adhesion, but can change the particles' internal structure. Cold-sprayed coatings can also exhibit micro- and nanotextured morphologies not achievable by other means. Suspending micro- or nanoparticles in a liquid and cold-spraying the suspension produces fine atomization and even deposition of materials that could not otherwise be processed. The scalability and low cost of this method and its compatibility with roll-to-roll processing make it promising for many applications, including ultrathin flexible materials, solar cells, touch-screen panels, nanotextured surfaces for enhanced heat transfer, thermal and electrical insulation films, transparent conductive films, materials for energy storage (e.g., Li-ion battery electrodes), heaters, sensors, photoelectrodes for water splitting, water purification membranes, and self-cleaning films.

Wind and battery ESS (BESS) are known for their complement and efficient approaches into the distribution networks. The promising of renewable energies for wind and solar in Afghanistan is a motivation for stepping up the power sector of the country by enhancing the power quality as well as self-dependency in electricity production. In this study, a multi-objective optimisation technique, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is proposed for an extensive distribution network in Kabul city considering technical, environmental, and financial control schemes for the network improvement. Three different scenarios with various objective functions are deemed to evaluate their impact on decision variables and network parameters. Furthermore, optimum allocation of the wind turbine and charge/discharge scheduling of BESS are revealed with improvement in performance of the power system. Simulations are deployed in MATLAB (R) with its application on developed 162-bus real-distribution network to demonstrate the effect of different objective function arrangements in each scenario as well as confirming the robustness of the proposed approach.

A critical review of high-temperature reversible thermochemical energy storage systems	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Review						High-temperature thermal storage; Thermochemical energy storage materials; Solid-gas and gas-gas reactions; Prototype developments; Cyclic studies	CONCENTRATED SOLAR POWER; FLUIDIZED-BED REACTOR; OXIDE REDOX SYSTEMS; CHEMICAL HEAT-PUMP; METAL-HYDRIDES; CO2 CAPTURE; MAGNESIUM HYDRIDE; CARBON-DIOXIDE; LAB-SCALE; AMMONIA DISSOCIATION	Thermal energy storage promises to be cheaper, with significantly lesser environmental encroachment, compared to electrical energy storage in batteries. Among all thermal energy storage systems, thermochemical energy storage is the most promising due to its high energy density, high exergetic efficiency, and high operating temperature. This paper presents a review of thermal energy storage systems that are suitable for concentrating solar thermal power plant. The review here mainly focuses on experimental studies carried out on solid-gas, gas-gas, and sulfuric acid/sulfur-based thermochemical energy storage systems that operate above 300 degrees C. Also, various reactor designs and storage concepts for solid-gas and gas-gas reaction systems and cyclic studies for the case of a solid-gas system are addressed. Finally, a comparative summary is presented, preparing the path for the future course of research and development. The review reveals that the carbonate systems are an economically viable option as future thermal energy storage system if their cyclic stability and reversibility are improved. A new metal hydride thermal energy storage system is proposed that would provide cooling and heat upgradation as an additional output. For gas-gas reactions, the major challenges are the development of efficient solar receiver and optimization of the catalyst use.	[Prasad, J.

J	Yu, XW; Yu, WA; Manthiram, A				Yu, Xingwen; Yu, Wiley A.; Manthiram, Arumugam			A Unique Single-Ion Mediation Approach for Crossover-Free Nonaqueous Redox Flow Batteries with a Na+-Ion Solid Electrolyte	SMALL METHODS			English	Article						electrochemistry; energy storage; nonaqueous redox flow batteries; single-ion mediation; solid electrolyte	RENEWABLE ENERGY-SOURCES; FOSSIL-FUELS; STORAGE; FOOD; NITROBENZENE; WATER; INTERMITTENCY; GENERATION; VEHICLE; SOLAR	Nonaqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs) provide significant advantages over aqueous RFBs because the use of nonaqueous electrolytes offers the possibilities of operating RFBs at higher voltages (above the water break-down voltage) and low temperatures (below 0 degrees C, the freezing point of H2O). However, the advancement of RFBs has long been plagued by the chemical-crossover problem due to a lack of reliable separators. Herein, a single-ion mediation strategy is presented for the advancement of nonaqueous RFBs by employing a Na+-ion solid electrolyte. The catholyte and anolyte in a single cell are physically and electrically separated, but the redox reactions at the cathode and anode are ionically linked by sodium ions, which shuttle between the catholyte and anolyte through the solid electrolyte. To accommodate the mediating Na+-ions, both the catholyte and anolyte are well managed through the addition of appropriate supporting electrolytes. The proposed unique RFB concept is validated with a chromium (III) acetylacetonate symmetric redox chemistry and the nitrobenzene-bromine redox couple.

Transition metal selenides exhibit optimal electronic conductivity and tunable physicochemical properties, which endow them with potential for efficient electrocatalysts to facilitate the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions (ORR and OER). Herein, hollow NixCo0.85-xSe nanospheres were synthesized using a facile polyol based solution chemical method. The NixCo0.85-xSe exhibits an onset overpotential of 0.89 V for ORR, and an overpotential of 305 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) for OER. Moreover, the NixCo0.85-xSe based Zn-air battery displays remarkable specific capacity and durability. Such superior catalytic performances can be attributed to the synergistic effect, large specific surface area and enhanced electron transfer rate. This approach provides a new way to design highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for electrochemical energy storage and utilization.

Virtual Excited State Reference for the Discovery of Electronic Materials Database: An Open-Access Resource for Ground and Excited State Properties of Organic Molecules	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article							ORBITAL METHODS; BINDING-SITE; FORCE-FIELD; DESIGN; PHOTOVOLTAICS; FUNCTIONALS	This letter announces the Virtual Excited State Reference for the Discovery of Electronic Materials Database (VERDE materials DB), the first database to include downloadable excited-state structures (S-0, S-1, T-1) and photophysical properties. VERDE materials DB is searchable, open-access via www.verdedb.org , and focused on light-responsive pi-conjugated organic molecules with applications in green chemistry, organic solar cells, and organic redox flow batteries. It includes results of our active and past virtual screening studies; to date, more than 13 000 density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been performed on 1 500 molecules to obtain frontier molecular orbitals and photophysical properties, including excitation energies, dipole moments, and redox potentials. To improve community access, we have made VERDE materials DB available via an integration with the Materials Data Facility. We are leveraging VERDE materials DB to train machine learning algorithms to identify new materials and structure-property relationships between molecular ground- and excited-states. We present a case-study involving photoaffinity labels, including predictions of new diazirine-based photoaffinity labels anticipated to have high photostabilities.

Conventional approaches to incorporate oxygen defects mainly rely on reducing the oxygen partial pressure for the removal of product to change the equilibrium position. However, directly affecting reactants to shift the reaction toward generating oxygen vacancies is lacking and to fill this blank in synthetic methodology is very challenging. Here, a strategy is demonstrated to create oxygen vacancies through making the reaction energetically more favorable via applying interfacial strain on reactants by coating, using TiO2(B) as a model system. Geometrical phase analysis and density functional theory simulations verify that the formation energy of oxygen vacancies is largely decreased under external strain. Benefiting from these, the obtained oxygen-deficient TiO2(B) exhibits impressively high level of capacitive charge storage, e.g., approximate to 53% at 0.5 mV s(-1), far surpassing the approximate to 31% of the unmodified counterpart. Meanwhile, the modified electrode shows significantly enhanced rate capability delivering a capacity of 112 mAh g(-1) at 20 C (approximate to 6.7 A g(-1)), approximate to 30% higher than air-annealed TiO2 and comparable to vacuum-calcined TiO2. This work heralds a new paradigm of mechanical manipulation of materials through interfacial control for rational defect engineering.

Herein, a highly efficient CO2ER electrocatalyst composed of coordinatively unsaturated single-atom copper coordinated with nitrogen sites anchored into graphene matrix (Cu-N-2/GN) is reported. Benefitting from the unsaturated coordination environment and atomic dispersion, the ultrathin Cu-N-2/GN nanosheets exhibit a high CO2ER activity and selectivity for CO production with an onset potential of -0.33 V and the maximum Faradaic efficiency of 81% at a low potential of -0.50 V, superior to the previously reported atomically dispersed Cu-N anchored on carbon materials. Experimental results manifest the highly exposed and atomically dispersed Cu-N-2 active sites in graphene framework where the Cu species are coordinated by two N atoms. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the optimized reaction free energy for Cu-N-2 sites to capture CO2 promote the adsorption of CO2 molecules on Cu-N-2 sites; meanwhile, the short bond lengths of Cu-N-2 sites accelerate the electron transfer from Cu-N-2 sites to *CO2, thus efficiently boosting the *COOH generation and CO2ER performance. A designed rechargeable Zn-CO2 battery with Cu-N-2/GN nanosheets deliver a peak power density of 0.6 mW cm(-2), and the charge process of battery can be driven by natural solar energy.

Particularly, the development and verification stage of HPP controls requires reduced-order models to minimize the complexity and computation effort of simulation platforms. In this paper, such models are proposed, and the most essential parts of the models are validated through field measurements. The models target power system integration studies involving active and reactive power, as well as frequency and voltage regulation where detailed models, as proposed in the standards, can be cumbersome. Field measurements of two Vestas WTGs, one 1-MW PV plant, and one 1-MW/1-MWh BESS are used for model validation. The results show that the WTG and PV performance models correctly estimate the power generation variability according to fluctuations in wind speed and solar irradiance. The BESS performance model provides satisfactory results related to grid-forming control performance and estimation of state-of-charge. The presented validation work enables using the proposed performance models for power system studies and HPP control design in all model-based design stages, that is, preliminary analysis, design, verification, and validation with a high level of confidence.

Development of a Control Platform for a Building-Scale Hybrid Solar PV-Natural Gas Microgrid	ENERGIES			English	Article						microgrids; hierarchical control; microturbines; hybrid solar PV-gas systems; distributed energy resource dispatch optimization; battery management systems; demand response	ENERGY MANAGEMENT; OPERATION; IRRADIANCE	Building-scale microgrids are a type of behind-the-meter microgrids where the building operator has control of the distributed energy resources, including, in this case, a natural gas-fired microturbine in addition to solar PV and battery energy storage systems. There is a growing trend in deploying behind-the-meter microgrids due to their benefits including the resiliency of serving critical loads, especially in regions with abundant natural gas. In order to ensure distributed energy resources are dispatched optimally for the desired mode of operation, a hierarchical control platform including a centralized controller was developed and installed. The platform includes communication and control infrastructure that interface with controllers for distributed energy resources and the building automation system of a recently built energy efficient commercial building. Based on desirable outcomes under different grid and building conditions, operational modes were defined for the microgrid controller. The controller is programmed to map each mode to respective operational modes for distributed energy resources controllers. Experimental data for test runs corresponding to two operational modes confirm the communication and control infrastructure can execute hierarchical control commands. Finally, dispatch optimization for a year-long simulation of system operation is presented and the benefits of the hybrid solar PV-natural gas setup are evaluated.

A Stand-Alone Hybrid Photovoltaic, Fuel Cell, and Battery System: Case Studies in Jordan	JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESOURCES TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article						hybrid; homer; energy; renewables	SOLAR-SYSTEM; ELECTRICITY	The main purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility of using a hybrid photovoltaic (PV), fuel cell (FC), and battery system to power different load cases, which are intended to be used at the Al-Zarqa governorate in Jordan. All aspects related to the potentials of solar energy in the Al-Hashemeya area were studied. The irradiation levels were carefully identified and analyzed and found to range between 4.1 and 7.6 kWh/m(2)/day; these values represented an excellent opportunity for the photovoltaic solar system. HOMER (Hybrid Optimization model for Multiple Energy Resources) software is used as an optimization and sizing tool to discuss several renewable and nonrenewable energy sources, energy storage methods, and their applicability regarding cost and performance. Different scenarios with photovoltaic slope, diesel price, and fuel cell cost were done. A remote residential building, school, and factory having an energy consumption of 31 kWh/day with a peak of 5.3 kW, 529 kWh/day with a maximum of 123 kW and 608 kWh/day with a maximum of 67 kW, respectively, were considered as the case studies' loads. It was found that the PV-diesel generator system with battery is the most suitable solution at present for the residential building case, while the PV-FC-diesel generator-electrolyzer hybrid system with battery suites best both the school and factory cases. The load profile for each case was found to have a substantial effect on how the system's power produced a scheme. For the residential building, PV panels contributed by about 75% of the total power production, the contribution increased for the school case study to 96% and dropped for the factory case to almost 50%.

Evaluation of an Aqueous Biphenol- and Anthraquinone-Based Electrolyte Redox Flow Battery	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						flow battery; aqueous; organic electrolyte; anthraquinone; biphenol	4,4'-BIPHENOL; OXIDATION; DENSITY; STORAGE; COUPLES	Flow cell batteries are of particular interest for applications of large-scale energy storage from renewable sources (e.g., wind, solar, etc.), as these energy sources are often intermittent or vary periodically. Recently, aqueous soluble organic redox species have been studied as alternative electrolytes to overcome the limitations of current vanadium chemistry, namely, low energy density, moderate charge/ discharge efficiency, cost, and toxicity. Here, sulfonated derivatives of 4,4'-biphenol and 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone were synthesized and electrochemically characterized to evaluate their potential battery performance. Long-term charge/discharge cycling measurements of the flow cell battery were obtained to determine the energy efficiency, charge capacity, and chemical stability of the electrolyte system. These electrolytes produced a standard cell potential of 0.905 V with a current density up to 0.8 A/cm(2) and energy density of 45 Wh/L using 1 M electrolyte solutions, which is competitive with current vanadium-based electrolyte systems. The biphenol derivative appears to undergo a hydroxylation side reaction during charging cycles; however, once this reaction is complete Coulombic efficiency of the flow battery stabilizes at >95%.

However, adoption of these technologies may exacerbate issues related to mismatch of electricity supply and demand. In this study, we utilize a hybrid capacity expansion and dispatch model to quantify grid impacts of the conversion of the entire road vehicle fleet to electric vehicles by 2050. We examine impacts of policies, such as targeting a renewable energy penetration of 93%, using British Columbia as a case study. Scenarios making use of utility controlled charging of vehicles to balance supply and demand are further analyzed. Results show that although electrifying the entire road vehicle fleet will require generation capacity to increase by up to 60%, relative to a scenario without electrification, levelized cost of electricity only increases by 9% in the same scenario due to availability of low cost generation options such as wind and solar. We also find that a 93% renewable energy target leads to carbon abatement costs 30% lower than a scenario where this policy is removed. Further use of utility controlled charging reduces total system capacity up to 7%.

A review of energy harvesting using piezoelectric materials: state-of-the-art a decade later (2008-2018)	SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES			English	Review						energy harvesting; piezoelectricity; piezoelectric materials	HIGH-TEMPERATURE SENSITIVITY; MORPHOTROPIC PHASE-BOUNDARY; VIBRATION ENERGY; LOW-FREQUENCY; INTERNAL-RESONANCE; POWER-GENERATION; WIND ENERGY; WAVE ENERGY; TRIBOELECTRIC NANOGENERATORS; EXPERIMENTAL-VERIFICATION	Energy harvesting technologies have been explored by researchers for more than two decades as an alternative to conventional power sources (e.g. batteries) for small-sized and low-power electronic devices. The limited life-time and necessity for periodic recharging or replacement of batteries has been a consistent issue in portable, remote, and implantable devices. Ambient energy can usually be found in the form of solar energy, thermal energy, and vibration energy. Amongst these energy sources, vibration energy presents a persistent presence in nature and manmade structures. Various materials and transduction mechanisms have the ability to convert vibratory energy to useful electrical energy, such as piezoelectric, electromagnetic, and electrostatic generators. Piezoelectric transducers, with their inherent electromechanical coupling and high power density compared to electromagnetic and electrostatic transducers, have been widely explored to generate power from vibration energy sources. A topical review of piezoelectric energy harvesting methods was carried out and published in this journal by the authors in 2007. Since 2007, countless researchers have introduced novel materials, transduction mechanisms, electrical circuits, and analytical models to improve various aspects of piezoelectric energy harvesting devices. Additionally, many researchers have also reported novel applications of piezoelectric energy harvesting technology in the past decade. While the body of literature in the field of piezoelectric energy harvesting has grown significantly since 2007, this paper presents an update to the authors' previous review paper by summarizing the notable developments in the field of piezoelectric energy harvesting through the past decade.

Both F-TiO2 and TiOF2 have been studied extensively for this purpose. However, fabrication of fluorine doped titanium oxide requires the use of dangerous fluorinated chemicals such as trifluoroacetic acid, hydrofluoric acid and fluorine gas which are both difficult to handle and create significant waste detrimental for the environment. Additionally, current procedures for fabrication of FTiO2 and TiOF2 require long heating times which are inefficient, wasting large amounts of energy. Because of these factors, fabrication of F-TiO2, TiOF2 and of other important fluorine doped metal oxides is expensive and dangerous to make. In this work, two new methods were used to greatly improve the safety and efficiency of synthesis. First, the fluorinated waste was eliminated by using the safe and inert polymer, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), as the fluorine source. Second, microwave (MW) irradiation was used to reduce the time and energy required for synthesis by addition of the MW absorber, graphene, into the precursor material. The results show that when using the PVDF fluorine source with conventional oven heating it results in low levels of F-TiO2 which are dependent on heating temperatures. However, when using microwave irradiation high levels of doping were achieved creating both F-TiO2 and TiOF2 in as little as 6 min compared to several hours. This work has shown that by combining both PVDF and microwave irradiation fabrication of F-TiO2 and TiOF2 can now be done safely and efficiently with greatly reduced environmental impact.

The effective use of such an intermittent energy source relies on development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy conversion and storage technologies. Here, we design a novel solar-driven regenerative electrochemical system for simultaneous photoelectric energy harvesting and storage. With rational screening of redox species and comprehensive electrochemical study, a high Seebeck coefficient of -1.8 mV K-1 is achieved by solely exploiting earth-abundant materials based on the thermogalvanic effect. A high energy conversion efficiency (1.23%, and 11.9% versus the Carnot efficiency) is achieved under a low temperature gradient of 35 degrees C. Moreover, the durability of the proof-of-concept device has been examined under solar irradiation employing the bifunctional current collector/solar absorber with good electrical conductivity, efficient solar absorption and photothermal transduction. This innovative cell design integrating simultaneous energy conversion and storage represents an alternative approach towards cost-effective harnessing of solar energy and even more broad thermal energy in ambient environments.

The mathematical model of a MicroCSP system is derived and integrated into the building thermal model of an office building at Michigan Technological University. Then, the MPC framework is used to optimize thermal energy storage (TES) system usage, the energy conversion in the Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC), and the thermal energy flows to the HVAC system. The MPC results for energy and cost savings show the significance of understanding system dynamics and designing a real-time predictive controller to maximize the benefits of MicroCSP thermal and electrical energies production. Indeed, the designed MPC framework provided 37% energy saving and 70% cost saving compared to the conventional rule-based controller (RBC). Furthermore, the MicroCSP integration into the building HVAC is compared to the alternative of integrating photovoltaic (PV) panels and battery energy storage (BES) system to address the building HVAC needs. The results show the MicroCSP system outperforms PV solar panels for energy saving, while the PV panels outperform the MicroCSP system for cost saving when dynamic pricing is applied.

The objective is to minimize energy loss and operation cost of agents, including conventional distributed generators, wind turbines, photovoltaics, demands, battery storage systems, and microgrids aggregator agent. To forecast market prices, wind generation, solar generation, and load demand, a deep learning-based approach is designed based on a combination of convolutional neural networks and gated recurrent unit. Each agent utilizes the designed learning approach and its own historical data to forecast its required parameters/data for scheduling purposes. To preserve the information privacy of agents, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is utilized to find the optimal operating point of microgrid distributedly. To enhance the convergence performance of the distributed algorithm, an accelerated ADMM is presented based on the concept of over-relaxation. In the proposed framework, the agents do not need to share with other parties either their historical data for forecasting purposes or commercially sensitive information for scheduling purposes. The proposed framework is tested on a realistic test system. The forecast values obtained by the proposed forecasting method are compared with several other methods and the accelerated distributed algorithm is compared with the standard ADMM and analytical target cascading.

A portable miniaturized laser heterodyne radiometer (mini-LHR) for remote measurements of column CH4 and CO2	APPLIED PHYSICS B-LASERS AND OPTICS			English	Article							ATMOSPHERIC CARBON-DIOXIDE; MAUNA-LOA; NETWORK; CALIBRATION; INSTRUMENT	We present the design of a portable version of our miniaturized laser heterodyne radiometer (mini-LHR) that simultaneously measures methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmospheric column. The mini-LHR fits on a backpack frame, operates autonomously, and requires no infrastructure because it is powered by batteries charged by a folding 30 W solar panel. Similar to our earlier instruments, the mini-LHR is a passive laser heterodyne radiometer that operates by collecting sunlight that has undergone absorption by CH4 and CO2. Within the mini-LHR, sunlight is mixed with light from a distributive feedback (DFB) laser centered at approximately 1.64 mu m where both gases have absorption features. The laser scans across these absorption features roughly every minute and the resulting beat signal is collected in the radio frequency (RF). Scans are averaged into half hour and hour data products and analyzed using the Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG) retrieval to extract column mole fractions. Instrument performance is demonstrated through two deployments at significantly different sites in interior Alaska and Hawaii. The resolving power (lambda/ increment lambda) is greater than 500,000 at 1.64 mu m with precisions of better than 20 ppb and 1 ppm for CH4 and CO2, respectively. Because mini-LHR instruments are portable and can be co-located, they can be used to characterize bias between larger, stationary, column observing instruments. In addition, mini-LHRs can be deployed quickly to respond to transient events such as methane leaks or can be used for field studies targeting geographical regions.	[Wilson, E.

In this micro-grid (MG) system, solar panels and power grid supply the electricity to the building and the BES acts as a buffer to alleviate the uncertain effects of solar energy generation and the demands of the building. In this study, we formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and model the uncertainties in the MG system, using martingale model of forecast evolution method. To control the system, lookahead policies with deterministic/stochastic forecasts are implemented. In addition, wait-and-see, greedy and updated greedy policies are used to benchmark the performance of lookahead policies. Furthermore, by varying the charging/discharging rate, we obtain the different battery size (E-s) and transmission line power capacity (P-max) accordingly, and then we investigate how the different E-s and P-max affect the performance of control policies. The numerical experiments demonstrate that the lookahead policy with stochastic forecasts performs better than the lookahead policy with deterministic forecasts when the E-s and P-max are large enough, and the lookahead policies outperform the greedy and updated policies in all case studies.

In this review, the recent advances in 3D printing of emerging batteries are emphasized and discussed. The recent progress in fabricating 3D-printed batteries through the major 3D-printing methods, including lithography-based 3D printing, template-assisted electrodeposition-based 3D printing, inkjet printing, direct ink writing, fused deposition modeling, and aerosol jet printing, are first summarized. Then, the significant achievements made in the development and printing of battery electrodes and electrolytes are highlighted. Finally, major challenges are discussed and potential research frontiers in developing 3D-printed batteries are proposed. It is expected that with the continuous development of printing techniques and materials, 3D-printed batteries with long-term durability, favorable safety as well as high energy and power density will eventually be widely used in many fields.

Here, we design a sunlight promotion strategy into rechargeable zinc-air battery with significantly reduced charging potential below the theoretical cell voltage of zinc-air batteries. The sunlight-promoted zinc-air battery using BiVO4 or alpha-Fe2O3 air photoelectrode achieves a record-low charge potential of similar to 1.20 and similar to 1.43 V, respectively, under illumination, which is lowered by similar to 0.5-0.8 V compared to the typical charge voltage of similar to 2 V in conventional zinc-air battery. The band structure and photoelectrochemical stability of photoelectrodes are found to be key factors determining the charging performance of sunlight-promoted zinc-air batteries. The introduction of photoelectrode as an air electrode opens a facile way for developing integrated single-unit zinc-air batteries that can efficiently use solar energy to overcome the high charging overpotential of conventional zinc-air batteries.

Robust, Scalable Synthesis of the Bulky Hagfeldt Donor for Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells	CHEMSUSCHEM			English	Article						amines; dyes; solar cells; Hagfeldt donor; redox shuttles	REDOX SHUTTLES; SILYL-ANCHOR; BATTERY	The bulky triarylamine group commonly referred to as the "Hagfeldt donor" is a key building block found in many of the organic dyes used in dye-sensitized applications such as dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). This building block has gained popularity owing to its presence in many of the best-performing DSC devices reported to date, which use dyes containing this donor group. The Hagfeldt donor provides a desirable 3-dimensional structure that aids in surface protection of electrons injected into the semiconductor from oxidants in the electrolyte, allowing for record-setting cobalt- and copper-based redox shuttles to be utilized more frequently. However, the synthesis of this molecule has proven unreliable for many routes. This study concerns a novel, reliable and scalable five-step synthesis of the Hagfeldt donor.

Moreover, combining the use of their porous nature with tailored reactivity at the metal struts and organic linkers provides valuable tools for energy-related applications. An exciting new research area that is expected to be highly beneficial for energy-related MOF use is the control of MOF morphology to develop nanosheets, nanorods and nanocrystals. Nanoscale MOFs offer larger external surface areas, easier access to functional groups, and close contact with other materials in hybrid structures that result in faster electron and ion transfer, in addition to ease of fabrication into thin films. This review provides an overview of the recent development of nanoscale MOFs as pristine materials or as a component in hybrid structures for solar energy conversion, supercapacitors, batteries and fuel cells.

In this work, we present a halogen element (chlorine) doping strategy to design low-cost perovskite-type electrocatalysts with enhanced IRR activity and stability. The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) assembled by the LaFeO2.965-delta Cl0.035 cathode delivers an attractive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.4% with a remarkable PCE enhancement factor of 23% compared with Pt, which is higher than most of the reported non-Pt DSSC cathodes. Attractively, LaFeO2.965-delta Cl0.035 displays superior IRR activity/stability and structural stability in the I-3(-)/I--based electrolyte compared to pristine LaFeO3 because chlorine doping facilitates the creation of oxygen vacancies (active sites) and enhances surface acidity simultaneously. This study provides a new way for designing outstanding IRR electrocatalysts, which could be applied to many redox couple-mediated photo/electrochemical devices.

J	Park, WY; Shah, N; Phadke, A				Park, Won Young; Shah, Nihar; Phadke, Amol			Enabling access to household refrigeration services through cost reductions from energy efficiency improvements	ENERGY EFFICIENCY			English	Article						Refrigerators; Energy efficiency; Energy access; Off-grid market; transformation		Refrigerators are widely used by consumers with access to the electricity grid but rarely used in off-grid settings where households rely on a limited supply of electricity such as that by a stand-alone solar home system, because refrigerators' power consumption requires a solar system size that is unaffordable for most consumers. Reducing the power consumption of refrigerators by improving their efficiency is one solution to this issue. In this paper, we assess the technical potential and costs of using commercially available technology to reduce the energy consumption of small (50- and 100-L) refrigerators. Our analysis shows that refrigerator electricity consumption can be reduced by about 50% and 70% using commercially available energy-efficient components at an incremental cost of about $45-$60 and $100-$120 per unit, respectively. Further, we find that highly efficient small refrigerators can be potentially available less than $300 if they sold at scale unlike much higher prices seen in the market today. We also find that the total annualized cost of an off-grid solar home system (including the cost of the refrigerator) can be decreased by about 50% if the most efficient refrigerator we analyzed is used, compared with the same energy system with a standard refrigerator because the additional cost of the efficient refrigerator is significantly lower than the cost savings due to smaller capacity requirements for panels and batteries. We recommend that policies such as awards, procurement, and standards be considered to facilitate the adoption of energy-efficient refrigerators in off-grid and microgrid settings.

In order to transition to the smart grid of the future, MGs must be properly managed and controlled. This paper proposes a microgrid energy management system (MGEMS) based on a hybrid control algorithm that combines Transactive Control (TC) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) for an efficient management of DERs in prosumer-centric networked MGs. A locally installed home energy management system (HEMS) determines a charge schedule for the battery electric vehicle (BEV) and a charge-discharge schedule for the solar photovoltaic (PV) and battery energy storage system (BESS) to reduce residential customers' operation cost and to improve their overall savings. The proposed networked MGEMS strategy was implemented in IEEE 33-bus test system and evaluated under different BEV and PV-BESS penetration scenarios to study the potential impact that large amounts of BEV and PV-BESS systems can have on the distribution system and how different pricing mechanisms can mitigate these impacts. Test results indicate that our proposed MGEMS strategy shows potential to reduce peak load and power losses as well as to enhance customers' savings.

In particular, the formation and growth of Solid Electrolyte Interface (SEI) have been considered as one of the primary degradation mechanisms affecting the cycle life of the battery. Over the past decade, several models have been reported towards simulation of SEI growth-induced degradation and prediction of cycle life. In this work, an efficient reduced-order electrochemical model was developed for a lithium cobalt oxide/graphite battery. A reaction-diffusion based SEI model was integrated with the electrochemical model to predict the cyclic capacity loss due to electrolyte deposition on the anode. The algorithm developed for this battery module was designed to reduce the computational time for capacity fade calculation with any (dis)charging protocol. The model was also applied for a lithium ferrous phosphate/graphite cell and in both cases, the fade predictions were within +/- 1% deviation from the experimental results. A comparison of two charging protocols was undertaken to identify approaches that improve capacity fade characteristics of battery. The electrochemical benefit of a reduced fading rate for aged (or used) lithium battery was investigated. A concept of "aged-battery" was proposed to be used as an advantage for better cycle-life in battery for biomedical devices and recycling of electric vehicle battery for solar panels applications. An economic analysis was performed to justify the benefits from lower fade that was weighed against the additional cost involved in aging the battery.

Economic viability of captive off-grid solar photovoltaic and diesel hybrid energy systems for the Nigerian private sector	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS			English	Article						Autoproduction; Captive power; Diesel generator; Off-grid; Solar photovoltaic; Nigeria	LEARNING-CURVE; RENEWABLE ENERGY; POWER; COST; PERFORMANCE; BATTERY; ELECTRICITY; POTENTIALS; POLICY; ISSUES	It is well established that lack of both electric supply capacity and reliability weaken the Nigerian economy. Recently, the reduction in solar photovoltaic (PV) costs along with the technical potential to couple PV to hybrid battery and diesel generators provides Nigerian businesses with an opportunity to reduce operating costs while defecting from the grid. This study investigates the potential of using off-grid hybrid energy systems for private industries within and near Lagos state currently with relatively high daily electricity demands that are met with supply through captive diesel generation. The results based on simulations of six industry sector load profiles developed from surveys found solar PV and diesel hybrid energy systems are economically viable for a wide array of industries in the Nigerian private sector including real estate, education, banking, automobile, hospitality and production. Five of the six sectors had discounted payback times for the systems under a year and ROIs > 100%. The results established that the levelized cost of electricity is lower for every sector analysed with inclusion of solar PV, lower still with coupling of batteries and more reliable than the current grid-provided electricity. Nigeria as a whole will also benefit from widespread adoption of solar hybrid systems, as it will assist the balance of trade by reducing refined petroleum imports. In conclusion, the results of this study make it clear that every scale of Nigerian businesses could increase profitability with the use of solar hybrid systems.

While highly miniaturized low cost sensor technology is quickly evolving, there is also a need for the advancement of mid-tier systems that are closer to reference-grade technologies in their longevity and performance, but also feature compactness that requires less significant infrastructure. This project evaluated the performance of a prototype solar-powered air monitoring system known as a Village Green Project (VGP) system with wireless data transmission that was deployed on a school rooftop in Hong Kong and operated for over one year. The system provided highly time-resolved and long-term data utilizing mid-tier cost ozone, PM2.5 and meteorological instruments. It operated with very minimal maintenance but shading by a nearby building reduced solar radiation, thus battery run time, over the 16-months measurement period, approximately 330,000 1-min observations were recorded (data completeness of similar to 62%). The monitoring data were evaluated by comparison with a nearby Hong Kong Environment Protection Department (EPD) station and exhibited good performance for 1-h resolution (R-2 = 0.74 for PM2.5 and R-2 = 0.76 for ozone). Furthermore as a demonstration, a nonparametric regression (NPR) model was applied for identifying the location of pollution source, combining air pollution and meteorological measurements. In addition, based on the high time-resolution wind data, local-scale back-trajectories were calculated as an input for receptor-oriented Nonparametric Trajectory Analysis (NTA) model. The combination of the VGP air monitoring system and NTA model identified apparent local sources in urban area. The demonstration was largely successful and operational improvements are clearly suggested to insure better siting and configurations to insure adequate power and air flow.

Taegi, South Korea	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRECISION ENGINEERING AND MANUFACTURING-GREEN TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Wind power; Wind hybrid systems; Energy storage systems; Microgrid simulation	RENEWABLE ENERGY-SOURCES; RURAL ELECTRIFICATION; TECHNOECONOMIC FEASIBILITY; SOLAR; MECHANISMS	In this study, wind-battery hybrid power systems are designed, evaluated, and optimized for regular supply of electrical power at a designated minimum load level with no shortage. Our simulation uses lead-acid batteries and vanadium redox flow batteries (VRBs) for storage, and utilizes hourly wind speed data measured in 2012 at Mt. Taegi in South Korea. Twenty Vestas V80 wind turbines, each rated at 2 MW, are used as power generators, on the basis of an actual wind turbine project recently installed at Mt. Taegi. Sale to the main grid of electricity generated in excess of the minimum load offset the initial capital costs for installation of the wind turbines and batteries. Results show that the optimized wind-VRB hybrid system can supply more than 9 MW of regular electrical power at no cost. Even higher levels of production are profitable with sale of the wind-generated electricity directly to a demand site at a price greater than the price of sales to the main grid. A reduction in the VRB electrolyte costs and an increase in carbon taxes can also increase profitability.

Estimation-Based Maximum Power Point Tracking in a Self-Balancing Photovoltaic Battery Energy Storage System	JOURNAL OF DYNAMIC SYSTEMS MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article							EQUIVALENT-CIRCUIT; MODEL; CHARGE; STATE; OPTIMIZATION	This paper examines the problem of controlling the exchange of current in photovoltaic-plus-storage systems to achieve photovoltaic (PV) maximum power point tracking (MPPT). This work is motivated by the need for MPPT algorithms that are less costly and complex to implement in PV farms with integrated battery energy storage. We study the online optimal control of a "hybrid" PV/lithium (Li)-ion battery integration topology that is self-balancing in nature. The self-balancing behavior ensures that the state of charge (SOC) across different cells balances to the same stable equilibrium value without needing any balancing power electronics, thereby significantly reducing the integration cost. The DC-DC converters in this hybrid system are controlled to achieve PV MPPT that maximizes energy generation and storage. However, sensing needs for traditional MPPT controllers can render the hybrid system unnecessarily complex and costly. We surmount this problem by: (i) developing a novel model-based PV power estimation algorithm that only requires voltage measurement, and (ii) using this algorithm together with extremumseeking (ES) control to achieve closed-loop, estimation-based PV MPPT. Simulation case studies show that this estimation-based MPPT controller is able to harness more than 99% of the maximum available solar energy under different irradiation profiles.

A two-step method, previously developed in the our laboratory for the electrodeposition of inorganic semiconductor films, was applied to the electrosynthesis of silver vanadate (AgVO3) films on transparent, conducting oxide surfaces. In the first step, silver was cathodically deposited from a non-aqueous bath containing silver nitrate. In the second step, the silver film was anodically stripped in an aqueous medium containing ammonium metavanadate. The anodically generated silver ions at the interface underwent a precipitation reaction with the vanadate species to generate the desired product in situ. Each of these steps were mechanistically corroborated via the use of electrochemical quartz crystal microgravimetry, used in conjunction with voltammetry and coulometry. As-deposited films were crystalline and showed p-type semiconductor behavior. Theoretical insights are provided for the electronic origin of the alpha ->beta phase transformation in AgVO3 and the disparate optical band gaps of the two polymorphs. Finally, implications for the application of this material in solar cells are provided.

J	Conlon, T; Waite, M; Modi, V				Conlon, Terence; Waite, Michael; Modi, Vijay			Assessing new transmission and energy storage in achieving increasing renewable generation targets in a regional grid	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Renewable energy resources; Integration pathways; Renewable generation targets; Transmission; Energy storage; Wind generation	WIND; INTEGRATION; SYSTEM; IMPACT	This study evaluates generation, transmission, and storage capacity needs to achieve deep renewable energy penetration in a regional electricity grid with an average load of approximately 20 GW. Increasing renewable energy targets are analyzed to evaluate the effects of realistic regional transmission upgrade and energy storage cost assumptions on the cost-optimal mix of generation, transmission, and storage capacity. Contextual data is used for New York State's grid to examine how electricity generation from renewable energy resources (wind, water, and solar power) can meet between 50% and 80% of electricity demand. A central finding of the study is that when realistic transmission upgrade costs are assumed, new interzonal transmission and battery storage are not needed to cost effectively meet near-term renewable energy goals. In fact, New York can achieve 50% renewable energy penetration with only a buildout of new generation capacity: Onshore wind (13.7 GW), offshore wind (4.1 GW), and solar photovoltaics (3 GW). The presence of grid-scale battery storage, electric vehicles, or additional behind-the-meter solar capacity does not markedly change the model-selected generation mix. To achieve the 50% target, we compute a $52/MWh levelized cost of electricity for new renewable energy, which is in line with current generation costs. As the renewable generation target increases beyond 50%, the model begins to select transmission upgrades and new storage capacity, the latter particularly if battery costs continue to decline as anticipated. At deeper targets, marginal generation capacity would otherwise experience high curtailment primarily due to supply demand imbalances; we calculate the value of energy storage at a 65% renewable energy penetration level to be 2.5-3 times higher than its value at a 50% level. However, the additional storage and generation and transmission, to a lesser degree - needed to achieve longer-term renewable energy goals lead to a substantial rise in total investment. Between 50% and 55% targets, the computed marginal levelized cost of electricity for new variable renewable energy is $94/MWh, compared to $592/MWh between 75% and 80%, suggesting alternative integration measures are likely necessary at such high penetration rates.

Stand-alone and self-sustained paper-based systems are essential to providing effective and lifesaving treatments in resource-constrained environments. Therefore, a realistic and accessible power source is required for actual paper-based POC systems as their diagnostic performance and portability rely significantly on power availability. Among many paper-based batteries and energy storage devices, paper-based microbial fuel cells have attracted much attention because bacteria can harvest electricity from any type of organic matter that is readily available in those challenging regions. However, the promise of this technology has not been translated into practical power applications because of its short power duration, which is not enough to fully operate those systems for a relatively long period. In this work, we for the first time demonstrate a simple and long-lasting paper-based biological solar cell that uses photosynthetic bacteria as biocatalysts. The bacterial photosynthesis and respiration continuously and self-sustainably generate power by converting light energy into electricity. With a highly porous and conductive anode and an innovative solid-state cathode, the biological solar cell built upon the paper substrates generated the maximum current and power density of 65 mu A/cm(2) and 10.7 mu W/cm(2), respectively, which are considerably greater than those of conventional micro-sized biological solar cells. Furthermore, photosynthetic bacteria in a 3-D volumetric chamber made of a stack of papers provided stable and long-lasting electricity for more than 5 h, while electrical current from the heterotrophic culture on 2-D paper dramatically decreased within several minutes.

Depending on their electrode configurations, FSESDs can contain five differently structured electrodes, including parallel fiber electrodes (PFEs), twisted fiber electrodes (TFDs), wrapped fiber electrodes (WFEs), coaxial fiber devices (CFEs), and rolled electrodes (REs). Various rational methods have been devised to incorporate these fiber-shaped electrodes into multifunctional FSESDs, including fiber-shaped supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, lithium-air batteries, zinc-air batteries, and aluminum-air batteries. Although significant progress has been made in FSESDs, it remains a major challenge to make high-performance fiber-shaped devices at low cost. A focused and critical review of the recent advancements in fiber-shaped supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries is provided here. The pros and cons for each of the aforementioned electrode configurations and FSESDs are discussed, along with current challenges and future opportunities for FSESDs.

A Bioresorbable Magnetically Coupled System for Low-Frequency Wireless Power Transfer	ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS			English	Article						bioelectronics; energy harvesters; RF inductors; transient electronics; wireless power transfer	TRANSIENT; ELECTRONICS; NANOPARTICLES; SENSORS; DESIGNS	Bioresorbable electronic technologies form the basis for classes of biomedical devices that undergo complete physical and chemical dissolution after a predefined operational period, thereby eliminating the costs and risks associated with secondary surgical extraction. A continuing area of opportunity is in the development of strategies for power supply for these systems, where previous studies demonstrate some utility for biodegradable batteries, radio frequency harvesters, solar cells, and others. This paper introduces a type of bioresorbable system for wireless power transfer, in which a rotating magnet serves as the transmitter and a bioresorbable antenna as the remote receiver, with capabilities for operation at low frequencies (<200 Hz). Systematic experimental and numerical studies demonstrate several unique advantages of this system, most significantly the elimination of impedance matching and electromagnetic radiation exposure presented with the types of radio frequency energy harvesters explored previously. These results add to the portfolio of power supply options in bioresorbable electronic implants.

Recent literature suggests that knowledge development and diffusion among different sectors can play a role in the establishment of a TIS. However, we lack an understanding of how the characteristics of different sectors involved in a TIS influence inter-sectoral learning, i.e. purposive learning-by-interacting between different sectors involved in a TIS. To address this gap, we examine how patterns of inter-sectoral learning vary across three TISs-solar photovoltaic systems, wind turbines, and lithium-ion batteries. Using concepts from the literature on sectoral systems of innovation, we show that the characteristics of the different sectors involved in the TIS influence patterns of inter-sectoral learning. Thus, we provide a systematic way of explaining differences in the importance of learning-by-interacting between different technologies observed in the empirical literature, helping policymakers anticipate potential failures in inter-sectoral learning, and we suggest measures to address them. We also demonstrate the value of explicitly analyzing the sectoral configuration in future TIS analyses, and hence contribute to more closely integrating the literatures on TIS and sectoral systems of innovation.

However, traditional synthesis methods such as soft-templating and hierarchical self-assembly methods can hardly realize the controllable synthesis of HoMSs, thus limiting their development and application. Here, the development process of HoMSs is first succinctly reviewed and the shortcomings of the traditional synthesis method are concluded. Subsequently, the sequential templating approach, which shows great generality for the synthesis of HoMSs with controllable composition and geometry configuration and exhibits remarkable effect on the scientific research field, is introduced. The basic material science and chemical reaction mechanism involved in the synthesis and manipulation of HoMSs using the sequential templating approach are then explained in detail. In addition, the effect of the geometric characteristics of HoMSs on their application properties is highlighted. Finally, the current challenges and future research directions of HoMSs are also suggested.

Under conditions of iodide oxidation, methyl-terminated n-Si microwire arrays exhibited stable short-circuit photocurrents over a time scale of days, albeit with low energy-conversion efficiencies. In contrast, electrochemical deposition of Pt onto methyl-terminated n-Si microwire arrays consistently yielded energy-conversion efficiencies of similar to 2% for iodide oxidation, with an open-circuit photovoltage of similar to 400 mV and a short-circuit photocurrent density of similar to 10 mA cm(-2) under 100 mW cm(-2) of simulated air mass 1.5G solar illumination. Platinized electrodes were stable for >200 h of continuous operation, with no discernible loss of Si or Pt.

Quantification of technological progress in greenhouse gas (GHG) capture and mitigation using patent data	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							CARBON CAPTURE; FUNCTIONAL-APPROACH; COMBINED-CYCLE; DESIGN	Greenhouse gas emissions from anthropogenic sources are believed to be the main cause of global warming and climate change. Furthermore, fossil fuels are forecasted to remain the dominant source of energy in the near future. Therefore, capture and sequestration of greenhouse gases and in particular carbon dioxide is likely to be a major pathway toward environmental protection and energy sustainability. Such clarity has stimulated an intense and diverse range of research into various capture and mitigation technologies, which race with global warming in real-time. Quantification of the performance improvement rates of these technologies can inform decision-makers' long-term investment strategies, and help researchers to identify technical bottlenecks and research potential. The present research estimates the yearly performance improvement rate of CO2 capture, non-CO2 GHG capture, and GHG mitigation technologies, using a novel method based on patent data and the corresponding citation network. Our findings suggest that membrane-based, condensation/rectification-based, and adsorption-based carbon capture are the most promising technologies. Furthermore, the average CO2 capture technologies are likely to improve slightly faster than solar, wind, and battery technologies, indicating their important role in future electrical grids. Unfortunately, subterranean or submarine CO2 storage was identified as a slow-growing technological domain and potentially a bottleneck in the future sustainable carbon chain, which requires further efforts.

J	Waldman, J; Sharma, S; Afshari, S; Fekete, B				Waldman, John; Sharma, Shailesh; Afshari, Shahab; Fekete, Balazs			Solar-power replacement as a solution for hydropower foregone in US dam removals	NATURE SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article							IMPACTS; RIVERS; LAND	There is a growing dam removal movement in the United States, driven in part by environmental, safety and cost considerations. These include electricity-producing hydro-dams, many of which are ageing and will require substantial maintenance or removal over the coming decades. However, hydropower has been and remains an important source of energy for the development of the United States, presently generating about 6% of the nation's electricity while providing essential grid services. As a potential solution to the conflict between these imperatives, industrial-scale photovoltaics (PVs) could be used for replacement of the energy foregone from hydro-dam removals either by installing the PV infrastructure in the area formerly inundated by the dam reservoir or through offsite replacement. Presently, the total PV generation in the conterminous United States is 35,919 GWh yr(-1), or approximately 13% of hydropower generation. On the basis of actual hydropower generation in the conterminous United States in 2016 (that is, 274,868 GWh yr(-1)), we estimated that 529,885 ha of PVs would be needed to replace the generation of all 2,603 hydro-dams-an area approximately equal to the land size of Delaware. PVs could replace the total annual energy produced from these dams while requiring only 13% of their existing reservoir area. If all the hydro-dams in the United States were removed and only 50% of the emergent land was used for PVs, 945,062 GWh yr(-1) power could be generated, which is 3.44 times the current hydropower generation. These analyses are theoretical and do not consider costs, which would be highly site specific. Replacement by PVs without energy storage could not replicate the dispatchability and grid services provisions of existing hydropower facilities; however, improving battery storage capabilities may ameliorate this shortcoming. We suggest that PVs could replace much of the annual electricity output of hydro-dams in the United States while using substantially less land area and providing considerable environmental and ecological benefits.

The objective was to find the lowest levelized cost of energy (LCOE), with power reliability as the constraint. A genetic algorithm was used to solve the nonlinear integer programming problem. A site with brackish groundwater in Arizona, USA, was selected. The capacity of the RO system was 11.36 m(3)/d (3,000 gal/d), requiring a constant power consumption of 2.366 kW. The results showed that the optimal configuration was a hybrid photovoltaic/wind/diesel/battery system with LCOE 0.527 USD/kWh and the corresponding levelized cost of water 3.585 USD/m(3), which were about half of the 7.9 USD/m(3) currently paid by residents in the area. Sensitivity analyses showed that: (a) the LCOE was fairly insensitive to photovoltaic panel tilt angle over a range; (b) the optimal tilt angle for the hybrid system must be found in the context of the performance of the entire system; (c) the "more hybrid" the renewable energy system, the lower the LCOE; (d) the LCOE value was monotone increasing as diesel price or discount rate increasing, respectively, and different diesel price or discount rate could bring different optimal configurations with diesel generators.

The integration of such devices in distribution networks comprising of battery energy storage systems (BESSs) is considered as efficient and complementation approach which their well-managed configuration and scheduling via optimal arrangement yield not only productive and reliable power delivery to end-users, but cost-saving opportunity for utility managers. When dealing with photovoltaic (PV), reactive power capability of PV inverter is another aspect of interest that can contribute in enhancing effective penetration of wind, solar, and storage system into distribution networks. In this paper, a robust and novel optimization technique epsilon multiobjective genetic algorithm epsilon-MOGA is proposed and applied to a real 162-bus distribution network. A three-objective function optimization encompassing environmental, technical, and economic aspect is developed to size the centralized wind-farm and BESS parameters, distributed rooftop PV, and PV inverter reactive power control in an optimal manner. The proposed arrangement is simulated in MATLAB and compared with several cases to show its superior implementation concerning carbon emission reduction, better technical aspect, annual saving, and grid power alleviation.

In these battery applications, charge imbalance among battery cells/modules/packs becomes a common issue, which can reduce available battery capacity, accelerate battery degradation, and even cause some safety hazards. To tackle this issue, various battery charge equalization (BCE) systems have been proposed in recent decades, among which the module-based BCE system is widely viewed as a promising solution and has drawn increasing attention. In this paper, we study the module-based BCE systems by presenting a mathematical model that can characterize the charge transfer behavior in such systems, and then propose computationally efficient algorithms to estimate the instantaneous battery cell state of charge (SOC), charge equalization time, and charging/discharging time, based on given system parameters and various initial battery cell SOCs. In addition, the conditions are derived to ensure that all battery cells can reach charge equalization and then get fully charged/discharged together without overcharging/overdischarging. All theoretical results are illustrated and justified through extensive numerical experiments.

A Customer Centric Approach to the Use of Residential Batteries for Distribution Network Support	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID			English	Article						Battery storage; battery control; demand response; voltage regulation	COORDINATED CONTROL; REACTIVE POWER; IMPROVE; STORAGE; SYSTEM	This paper proposes and practically validates a control approach for distribution network (DN) support with customers' battery energy storage systems (BESSs). Use of customers' BESSs for DN support incurs a cost (disutility) to customers because a part of the storage capacity is used for DN support instead of solely benefitting the customer. An optimization problem is formulated to perform a tradeoff between the benefits to network operator and disutility to consumers. Control actions, i.e., charge and discharge trajectories of BESSs, are obtained by solving the optimization problem. Hardware in the loop (HIL) simulations of the proposed method, using a real-time digital simulator and a dSPACE controller board, are performed to assess its performance on a low voltage distribution network. HIL simulations show that in the presence of rooftop solar, the method is able to reduce voltage excursions while simultaneously reducing customers' cost.	[Deeba, S. R.; Sharma, R.; Saha, T.

Solar-Powered Point-of-Care Sonography: Our Himalayan Experience	JOURNAL OF ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE			English	Article						emergency medicine; global health; solar powered; ultrasound		The benefits of sonography utilization in low-resource communities has been thoroughly demonstrated in the literature.(1-3) As ultrasound units have become smaller and more portable, the feasibility of bringing these imaging devices into more remote areas is becoming a reality. One factor that limits ultrasound use in austere environments is battery life. Although solar power has been used for oxygen delivery(5,6) in resource-limited settings, its use in sonography has not been previously described. This report describes the use of a Lumify (Philips; Amsterdam, Netherlands) for a month-long trip into a remote Himalayan region of India powered exclusively with an Anker (Shenzhen, China) solar panel for the entirety of the trip.

Herein, we develop a low-cost and highly efficient precious-metal-free CO2ER electrocatalyst, composed of Ni nanoparticles (NPs) with the size range of 50-100 nm, confined within N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) with the diameter of 100-200 nm (Ni@NCNTs). Benefitting from the confinement effect, the resulting 1D Ni@NCNTs hybrid exhibits an exceptional electrocatalytic activity and selectivity for CO production with a relatively positive onset potential of -0.3 V, low Tafel slope of 97 mV dec(-1), and high Faradaic efficiency of 99.1%. The high selectivity of Ni@NCNTs for CO production during the CO2ER is almost the best among all previously reported N-doped carbon based CO2ER electrocatalysts. Experimental observations demonstrate that the confined Ni NPs inside NCNTs is a key step to promote the conversion of CO2 to CO. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the confinement effect of NCNTs can weaken the binding strengths between Ni NPs and *CO intermediates, thus improving the rate-limiting step of *CO desorption during the CO2ER process. Further integration of 1D Ni@NCNTs electrocatalyst with a solar panel or two alkaline batteries enable highly active and sustainable CO2ER and water splitting. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Concept of a distributed photovoltaic multilevel inverter with cascaded double H-bridge topology	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Multilevel inverter; Photovoltaic inverter; Cascaded H-bridge inverter; Maximum power point tracking; Look-up-table controller	POWER POINT TRACKING; CONVERTER; COMPENSATION; MODULATION; STRATEGY; SYSTEMS	This paper presents proof-of-concept of a novel photovoltaic (PV) inverter with integrated short-term storage, based on the modular cascaded double H-bridge (CHB2) topology, and a new look-up table control approach. This topology combines and extends the advantages of various distributed converter concepts, such as string inverters, microinverters, and cascaded H-bridge (CHB) multilevel inverters. The proposed CHB2 inverter incorporates individual PV elements into modules that can dynamically connect to their neighbors not only in series but also in parallel, which reduces conduction losses and enables simple module balancing. Maximum power-point tracking of the PV element is performed in each module. As a demonstration of the flexibility of the approach and to filter large power fluctuations before they enter the grid, each module further incorporates batteries for energy storage, which enables continuous power output by compensating solar power fluctuations, while the CHB2 can balance the batteries' load and state of charge. The inverter provides exceptionally high output quality without large filters, since the multilevel ac output is finely quantized. The elimination of extensive output filtering provides for an extremely rapid dynamic response as well. We furthermore introduce an optimized, computationally efficient, look-up-table-based controller and module scheduler which leverages the large number of degrees of freedom provided by the flexible series-parallel CHB2 configurations to optimize conduction loss, switching loss, and load balance. The method can be extended to CHB2 circuits in general to improve their performance while simplifying control. Finally, we demonstrate that the inverter is robust to open circuit failure of power switches or PVs.	[Goetz, Stefan M.; Wang, Chuang; Li, Zhongxi; Murphy, David L.

Here, we report a self-sustained soft oscillator that exhibits perpetual and untethered locomotion as a phototactic soft swimming robot, remotely fueled and steered by constant visible light. This particular out-of-equilibrium actuation arises from a self-shadowing-enabled negative feedback loop inherent in the dynamic light-material interactions, promoted by the fast and substantial volume change of the photoresponsive hydrogel. Our analytical model and governing equation unveil the oscillation mechanism and design principle with key parameters identified to tune the dynamics. On this autonomous oscillator platform, we establish a broadly applicable principle for converting a continuous input into a discontinuous output. The modular design can be customized to accommodate various forms of input energy and to generate diverse oscillatory behaviors. The hydrogel oscillator showcases agile life-like omnidirectional motion in the entire three-dimensional space with near-infinite degrees of freedom. The large force generated by the powerful and long-lasting oscillation can sufficiently overcome water damping and effectively self-propel away from a light source. Such a hydrogel oscillator-based all-soft swimming robot, named OsciBot, demonstrated high-speed and controllable phototactic locomotion. This autonomous robot is battery free, deployable, scalable, and integratable. Artificial phototaxis opens broad opportunities in maneuverable marine automated systems, miniaturized transportation, and solar sails.

Techno-economic optimization and social costs assessment of microgrid-conventional grid integration using genetic algorithm and Artificial Neural Networks: A case study for two US cities	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Microgrid; Techno-economic assessment; Environmental assessment (LCA); Genetic algorithm optimization; Artificial neural network; Carbon tax	POWER-SYSTEMS; HYBRID; SIMULATION; MODEL; DESIGN	Through two case studies, a methodology is presented that assessed the techno-economic and environmental performance of microgrid-conventional grid integration scenarios for fifty homes located in US cities of Fargo and Phoenix. The microgrid was composed of seven components - solar photovoltaics, wind-turbines, lead acid batteries, biodiesel generators, fuel cells, electrolyzers and H-2 tanks. Firstly, mathematical models that predicted the hourly power generation were developed for every microgrid component. Secondly, Artificial Neural Networks were utilized to predict hourly electricity demand and its results were validated with actual available data. Thirdly, through an electricity dispatch strategy and a Genetic Algorithm optimization technique, microgrid configurations were determined that had lowest levelized cost of energy, $/kWh. From peak power standpoint, four microgrid-conventional grid integration scenarios were examined, namely, microgrid possessing penetration level of 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%. Based on the environmental life cycle assessment of power generation, three carbon taxes were imposed -$12, $48, $72/tonne carbon dioxide emitted. Microgrid's electricity cost was found to be $0.43-0.86/kWh. Imposing carbon taxes barely showed any effect on microgrid's electricity cost nor its optimum configuration, but conventional grid's electricity cost was found to increase by 7-33% as its carbon emissions were five times as that of microgrid.

The renewable battery concept via conversion of agricultural waste into biocoal using frictional pyrolysis	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Renewable energy production; Energy storage; Biocoal; Lignocellulosic biomass; Power-to-fuel; Frictional pyrolysis	POWER-TO-GAS; BIOMASS GASIFICATION; ENERGY-STORAGE; CARBON; GENERATION; SCALE; SEQUESTRATION; ELECTRICITY; RESIDUES; BIOCHAR	The rapid growth of wind and solar power production installations worldwide has not been coupled with similar rates of integration in the electrical grid. This study proposes the conversion of agricultural residues into biocoal by means of frictional pyrolysis, which is a novel power-to-fuel technology that converts directly electricity into mechanical work and uses no additional heat. The excess renewable energy, that otherwise would be lost, will be utilized for converting agricultural residues into biocoal. This novel concept is defined as the concept of the renewable battery. A case study is presented for the State of California and three characteristic biomass types have been analyzed and converted into biocoal. The analysis showed that, between the years 2007-2016, the wind power installations have increased by 242.37% and the majority of solar PV were installed which account for 17,238 GWh. From the initial energy input of the biomass, the energy that was converted and stored in the form of biocoal ranged from 78.6% to 86.8%. The concept of renewable battery promotes carbon sequestration in agricultural practices and serves as a cleaner and renewable fuel that can be co-combusted with coal. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Techno-economic evaluation of different hybridization schemes for a solar thermal/gas power plant	ENERGY			English	Article						Plant-level hybridization; Grid-level hybridization; Concentrated solar power; Natural gas plant; Techno-economic analysis; Life cycle assessment	HYBRID ENERGY-STORAGE; PARABOLIC TROUGH; DYNAMIC SIMULATION; RANKINE-CYCLE; THERMODYNAMIC ANALYSIS; CARBON CAPTURE; SYSTEM; OPTIMIZATION; BATTERY; CSP	Stabilizing the effects of greenhouse gases emissions on the atmosphere is a key step towards solving the global climate change problem. The power industry is one of the major sectors for greenhouse gas emissions. One solution to help reduce emissions from the existing power plants is to hybridize them with renewable energy sources. Solar energy is a leading source among alternative energy sources due to its technological advancement and declining cost in recent years. Concentrated solar power is a mature solar technology that can play a major role in large-scale power production. Hybridizing concentrated solar power plants with natural gas plants can ensure a continuous and reliable power supply in meeting electricity demand. This study investigates the environmental impact and techno-economics of a hybrid natural gas/solar plant with a power production capacity of 140 MW. The system uses a tightly integrated design and a robust control scheme to exploit the synergies between natural gas and solar thermal power. A techno-economic comparison is made between the hybrid plant and two separate plants (solar thermal and natural gas) that are only connected at the grid-level as well as to a stand-alone natural gas plant. Simulation results demonstrate that the solar-to-electric efficiency and solar fraction in a plant-level hybrid unit increase by 77.7 and 69.6%, respectively, when compared to a grid-level hybrid unit. A sensitivity analysis on the plant economics reveals that a value of $146.2/tonne for the carbon tax and a renewable energy credit of 56.94% are required for the plant-level hybrid unit to break-even with the levelized cost of electricity production from the stand-alone natural gas plant. In contrast, the grid-level hybrid unit does not break-even with the levelized cost of electricity production from the natural gas plant within a reasonable range of carbon tax and renewable energy credit. The sensitivity analysis also demonstrates that a carbon tax will be a better leveraging tool to encourage greenhouse gas emissions reductions than the renewable energy credit. A life cycle assessment is also performed for the three systems considered in this work, while using their dynamic models and the relevant control schemes. This study shows that the greenhouse gas emissions in the grid-level hybrid unit and natural gas plant are 9.28% and 23.78%, respectively, higher than the plant-level hybrid unit. Hence, the plant-level hybrid unit emits the least amount of greenhouse gases while demonstrating the maximum synergistic benefits from hybridization. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Feasibility of Using sCO(2) Turbines to Balance Load in Power Grids with a High Deployment of Solar Generation	ENERGY			English	Article						Supercritical CO2 power cycles; Load balancing; Dynamic system modeling	ENERGY-SYSTEMS; WIND; OPTIMIZATION; VARIABILITY; FLEXIBILITY; PLANTS	Solar photovoltaic power generation capacity is growing rapidly, increasing the need for dynamic load balancing when solar production dips. This balancing might be delivered using energy storage and/or advanced power generation cycles, that are compact, dynamic, and highly efficient, such as supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO(2)) cycles. Here, the load balancing capability of a sCO(2) combined cycle plant was compared to open cycle and steam combined cycle gas turbines. A characteristic-based transient model was developed to evaluate the impact of machinery ramp rates, minimum part loads, and cycle efficiencies. High resolution demand and solar irradiance data from the University of Virginia campus, before and after installation of a major solar project, was used to represent low and high levels of solar deployment in the grid. The results suggest that under high deployment of solar power, sCO(2) cycles and steam combined cycle systems with ramp rates greater than 5.75%/minute can balance load and provide comparable levelized costs of electricity ($0.057/1(Wh). Solar curtailment was driven by the minimum part load capabilities. A sCO(2) cycle with a minimum part load of 30% was predicted to have a curtailment of 15% in the high solar scenario without a battery, and 4% with a 30 MWh battery. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Wide-bandgap perovskite photovoltaic cells for indoor light energy harvesting are presented with the 1.63 and 1.84 eV devices that demonstrate efficiencies of 21% and 18.5%, respectively, under indoor compact fluorescent lighting, with a champion open-circuit voltage of 0.95 V in a 1.84 eV cell under a light intensity of 0.16 mW cm(-2). Subsequently, a wireless temperature sensor self-powered by a perovskite indoor light-harvesting module is demonstrated. Three perovskite photovoltaic cells are connected in series to create a module that produces 14.5 mu W output power under 0.16 mW cm(-2) of compact fluorescent illumination with an efficiency of 13.2%. This module is used as an external power source for a battery-assisted radio-frequency identification temperature sensor and demonstrates a read range by of 5.1 m while maintaining very high frequency measurements every 1.24 s. The combined indoor perovskite photovoltaic modules and backscatter radio-frequency sensors are further discussed as a route to ubiquitous sensing in buildings given their potential to be manufactured in an integrated manner at very low cost, their lack of a need for battery replacement, and the high frequency data collection possible.

However, its utilization is largely hindered by poor cyclability and mechanical rigidity due to the lack of a flexible and durable catalyst electrode. Herein, flexible fiber-shaped Li-CO2 batteries with ultralong cycle-life, high rate capability, and large specific capacity are fabricated, employing bamboo-like N-doped carbon nanotube fiber (B-NCNT) as flexible, durable metal-free catalysts for both CO2 reduction and evolution reactions. Benefiting from high N-doping with abundant pyridinic groups, rich defects, and active sites of the periodic bamboo-like nodes, the fabricated Li-CO2 battery shows outstanding electrochemical performance with high full-discharge capacity of 23328 mAh g(-1), high rate capability with a low potential gap up to 1.96 V at a current density of 1000 mA g(-1), stability over 360 cycles, and good flexibility. Meanwhile, the bifunctional B-NCNT is used as the counter electrode for a fiber-shaped dye-sensitized solar cell to fabricate a self-powered fiber-shaped Li-CO2 battery with overall photochemical-electric energy conversion efficiency of up to 4.6%. Along with a stable voltage output, this design demonstrates great adaptability and application potentiality in wearable electronics with a breath monitor as an example.

In this model, the expected value of the sum of DGs' operation as well as start-up cost, the network-loss cost and the PV inverter's auxiliary service cost, is considered as the objective function. The stochastic MINNP model is transformed into a stochastic mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) model to reduce the computational complexity. The state-space approximate dynamic programming algorithm is adopted to solve the stochastic MISOCP model. In the algorithm, based on the approximate value functions of typical states that are computed according to the Markov decision process, solving the optimisation model of multiple periods is executed by solving each period's optimisation model one by one to improve the computational efficiency. Meanwhile, parallel computing is executed to greatly improve the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

To advance these devices requires a fundamental understanding of the complex chemical reactions, material transformations, and charge flow that are associated with energy conversion processes. Analytical in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) offers a powerful tool for directly visualizing these complex processes at the atomic scale in real time and in operando. Recent advancements in energy materials and devices that have been enabled by in situ TEM are reviewed. First, the evolutionary development of TEM nanocells from the open-cell configuration to the closed-cell, and finally the full-cell, is reviewed. Next, in situ TEM studies of rechargeable ion batteries in a practical operation environment are explored, followed by applications of in situ TEM for direct observation of electrocatalyst formation, evolution, and degradation in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells, and fundamental investigations of new energy materials such as perovskites for solar cells. Finally, recent advances in the use of environmental TEM and cryogenic electron microscopy in probing clean-energy materials are presented and emerging opportunities and challenges in in situ TEM research of energy materials and devices are discussed.

Compared to other fields in data science, the openness and accessibility of solar data is lacking, which prevents solar data science from catching up with the emerging trends of data science (e.g., deep learning). In this paper, OpenSolar, a package with both R and Python versions, is developed to enhance the openness and accessibility of publicly available solar datasets. The openSolar package provides access to multiple types of solar data, primarily from four datasets: (1) the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) Solar Power Data for Integration Studies dataset, (2) the NREL Solar Radiation Research Laboratory dataset, (3) the Sheffield Solar-Microgen database, and (4) the Dataport database. Unlike other open solar datasets that only contain meteorological data, the four datasets in the OpenSolar package also contain behind-the-meter power data, sky images, and solar power data with satisfactory temporal and spatial resolution and coverage. The overview, quality-control methods, and potential usage of the datasets, in conjunction with sample code implementing the open solar functions, are described in this paper. The package is expected to assist in bridging the gaps between the research fields of solar energy, power systems, and data science.

Hierarchical Distributed Model Predictive Control of Standalone Wind/Solar/Battery Power System	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN CYBERNETICS-SYSTEMS			English	Article						Back-calculation; distributed model predictive control (MPC); hierarchical control; microgrid; standalone wind/solar/battery system	WIND; MANAGEMENT	A microgrid is a distributed networked generation system, which can effectively integrate various sources of distributed generation, especially renewable energy sources into the information network. The standalone wind/solar/battery power system is a typical standalone microgrid, in which the wind and solar power generations are the intermittent systems with complex dynamics and multiconstraints. Coordinated optimization between the wind power and solar power generations can effectively meet the load demand, reduce wear and tear of generating units, prolong the lifetime and, thus, guarantee the safety of the power grid. Regarding the large-scale, geographically dispersed standalone wind/solar/battery power generation system, this paper constituted a hierarchical distributed model predictive control (HDMPC). In this HDMPC, the upper layer utilizes an iterative distributed control strategy to realize the coordination of the power dispatch. It thus reaches the economic object, e.g., reducing the torsional shaft torque transmitted to gearbox in wind turbine system. The lower layer utilizes the supervisory predictive control to realize both the economic and tracking property. Under this hierarchical structure, the back-calculation from the lower control layer to the upper layer is utilized to keep the consistency of constraints. Through coordinated optimization among the subsystems, the proposed HDMPC realizes the plug and play of distributed energy. The simulation and the experiment validate the advantages of the proposed method in that it can realize the reliability, high efficiency, flexibility, and interactivity for the microgrid control.

By capturing the existing thermal energy in railway tracks, this technology helps power rail-side sensors in off-grid and remote areas without depleting natural resources. In low latitudes such as southern China, the temperature of railway tracks can reach 57 degrees C due to solar radiation. However, at a relatively shallow depth (200 mm), the substratum below the track foundation (e.g., soils) has a lower temperature (i.e., 15 degrees C-26 degrees C). This temperature difference can be used to generate electricity through a thermoelectric generator (TEG). The proposed approach captures thermal energy from the railway track and transfers the energy to the TEG prototype beneath the bottom of rails. Evaluation of the prototype is conducted by finite volume analysis, field test, and laboratory experiment. The results indicate that the TEG prototype can produce 5.8 mW-316.8 mW of power across a resistant load at thermal gradient from 8 degrees C to 29.2 degrees C. A DC-DC buck-booster circuit with lithium battery management is developed to charge the batteries by the harvested thermal energy. The system operates at a low startup voltage of 0.9 V and its conversion efficiency is larger than 60%. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Machine-learned modeling of PM2.5 exposures in rural Lao PDR	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Air quality; Cookstoves; Prediction; Environmental health; Biostatistics'	INDOOR AIR-POLLUTION; PARTICULATE MATTER; PERSONAL EXPOSURES; CARBON-MONOXIDE; GLOBAL BURDEN; HOUSEHOLD; COMBUSTION; CHILDREN; WOMEN	This study presents a machine-learning-enhanced method of modeling PM2.5 personal exposures in a data-scarce, rural, solid fuel use context. Data collected during a cookstove (Africa Clean Energy (ACE)-1 solar-battery-powered stove) intervention program in rural Lao PDR are presented and leveraged to explore advanced techniques for predicting personal exposures to particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5). Mean 48-h PM2.5 exposure concentrations for female cooks were measured for the pre- and post-intervention periods (the "Before" and "After" periods, respectively) as 123 mu g/m(3) and 81 mu g/m(3). Mean 48-h PM(2.5 )kitchen air pollution ("KAP") concentrations were measured at 462 mu g/m(3) Before and 124 mu g/m(3) After. Application of machine learning and ensemble modeling demonstrated cross-validated personal exposure predictions that were modest at the individual level but reasonably strong at the group level, with the best models producing an observed vs. predicted r(2) between 0.26 and 0.31 (r(2) = 0.49 when using a smaller, un-imputed dataset) and mean Before estimates of 119-120 pg/m(3) and After estimates of 86-88 mu g/m(3). This offered improvement over one typical method of predicting exposure - using a kitchen exposure factor (the ratio of exposure to KAP)-which demonstrated an r(2) similar to 0.03 and poorly estimated group average values. The results of these analyses highlight areas of methodological improvement for future exposure assessments of household air pollution and provide evidence for researchers to explore the advantages of further incorporating machine learning methods into similar research across wider geographic and cultural contexts.

However current research tends to focus on a particular climate or location. This study analyzes four residences across four different climate zones in Arizona and explores the value of adding battery storage to a net-zero energy (NZE) photovoltaic (PV) system. Using the National Renewable Energy Lab's Building Optimization (BEopt) and System Advisor Model (SAM) tools, this study performs parametric analysis by varying battery size to determine a capacity that produces a maximum net present value (NPV). A sensitivity analysis on three possible future battery price trends is also performed. This study finds the NZE PV systems are only able to mitigate 37-44% of the peak electricity purchases and 4-12% of demand charges due to mismatch between solar potential and on peak hours. Adding large batteries, 1.5-1.6 times larger than required to meet the annual peak energy purchase requirements, provides a maximum NPV for PV-battery systems at locations with favorable utility rates. We conclude that the best economics are achieved, at both current and expected future battery prices, when batteries are sized to never require replacement during the PV system lifetime.

By examining the concurrent evolution of ionic distribution and spontaneous polarization of CsFAMA under light illumination using dynamic-strain-based scanning probe microscopy, strong linear piezoelectricity arising from photoenhanced polarization is observed, while ionic migration is found to be not significantly increased by lightening. Nanoscale photocurrents are mapped under a series of biases using conductive atomic force microscopy, revealing negligible difference between forward and backward scans, and local IV curves reconstructed from principal component analysis show minimal hysteresis of just 1%. These observations at the nanoscale are confirmed in a macroscopic perovskite solar cell made of CsFAMA, exhibiting a high efficiency of 20.11% and with hysteresis index as small as 3%. Ionic migration, polarization, and photocurrent hysteresis are thus directly correlated at the nanoscale, and photoenhanced polarization in triple-cation mixed-halide perovskites is established, which does not contribute to the photovoltaic hysteresis.

J	Cho, DJ; Valenzuela, J				Cho, Dongjin; Valenzuela, Jorge			Scheduling energy consumption for residential stand-alone photovoltaic systems	SOLAR ENERGY			English	Article						Stand-alone PV system; Optimal energy scheduling; Battery Size; Mixed-integer programming	MANAGEMENT	Among various renewable energy sources, solar energy is considered an effective solution to the shortage of energy in the future. A stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) system can be particularly impactful in an isolated area where access to the grid is limited or unavailable. Because solar energy generation primarily depends on the availability of solar Irradiance over time, energy management is crucial, which in turn can also satisfy user comfort and system efficiency. In this paper, we propose an energy consumption scheduling model for a residential house with a stand-alone PV system and battery. We develop a mixed-integer optimization model that uses consumption patterns and appliance priority to schedule the use of appliances. We test our model under four scenarios based on region and season. The results demonstrate that the proposed model provides optimal schedules for operating the appliances. In addition, we conduct a sensitivity analysis on the PV array size and the battery capacity. We compare the optimized case with the non-optimized case.

We propose using passive inspection CubeSats (PICs) to reliably and affordably image the launch vehicle with fine resolution, moderate coverage, and rapid response. The PICs mission, developed by Brigham Young University undergraduate students and manifested for launch in 2019, is designed to demonstrate this approach using two redundant CubeSats. Each CubeSat uses a spherical array of six cameras, 12 light-emitting diode flash units, and a field-programmable gate array to rapidly boot after separation and capture spherical images of its entire surroundings, including the launch vehicle and other released CubeSats. The PIC bus system includes several custom components, including a compact 3500-mAh battery system, 1 to 2 W solar power system, chassis, omnidirectional antenna system, radio, and a small integrated remove-before-flight-pin and system access port. Preliminary test results suggest the PICs are able to boot within 1.1 s of separation and inspect 1-mm features on each other and their launch vehicle, regardless of the spin developed at separation.

Although considerable research is devoted to studying and improving the round-trip efficiency of SFBs, little attention is paid to the device lifetime. Herein, a neutral pH aqueous electrolyte SFB with robust organic redox couples and inexpensive silicon-based photoelectrodes is demonstrated. Enabled by the excellent stability of both electrolytes and protected photoelectrodes, this SFB device exhibits not only unprecedented stable continuous cycling performance over 200 h but also a capacity utilization rate higher than 80%. Moreover, through comprehensive study on the working mechanisms of SFBs, a new theory based on instantaneous solar-to-output electricity efficiency toward more optimized device design is developed and a significantly improved solar-to-output electricity efficiency of 5.4% from single-junction silicon photoelectrodes is realized. The design principles presented in this work for extending device lifetime and boosting round trip energy efficiency will make SFBs more competitive for off-grid applications.

We present a comprehensive review of studies that examine the techno-economic feasibility of small-scale hybrid energy systems, and we find that the most common approach is to compare the annualized life-time costs to the expected energy output and choose the system with the lowest cost per output. While practical, this type of benefit-cost analysis misses out on other production and consumption decisions that are simultaneously made when adopting a hybrid energy system. In this paper, we propose a broader and more robust theoretical framework-based on production and utility theory-to illustrate how the production of renewable energy from multiple sources affects energy efficiency, energy services, and energy consumption choices in the residential sector. Finally, we discuss how the model can be applied to guide a hybrid-prosumer's decision-making in the US residential sector. Examining hybrid renewable energy systems within a solid economic framework makes the study of hybrid energy more accessible to economists, facilitating interdisciplinary collaborations.

Addressing integration challenges of high shares of residential solar photovoltaics with battery storage and smart policy designs	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						solar photovoltaics; battery storage; technology diffusion; energy policy; carbon emissions; electricity supply system	DISTRIBUTED GENERATION; SELF-CONSUMPTION; CROSS-SUBSIDIES; ENERGY-STORAGE; PV; SYSTEMS; ADOPTION; IMPACTS; TECHNOLOGIES; DEPLOYMENT	In many countries, the integration of growing shares of residential solar photovoltaics is beginning to challenge existing electricity systems. First, residential solar photovoltaics aggravates sharp system-wide load changes and, in turn, increases the need for fast-ramping generation capacity. Second, it reduces the demand for electricity provision from the grid, causing an increase in electricity prices as grid costs are recovered over smaller volumes of electricity. Battery storage (BS) mitigates the first integration challenge by flattening the system-wide load, but elevates the second by increasing self-consumption behind-the-meter. In face of this dilemma, the integration of high shares of residential solar photovoltaics requires policymakers to re-design public support policies. In this article, we develop an agent-based model to simulate California's residential 'solar-plus-storage' market between 2005 and 2030 in four different policy scenarios. By applying a multi-technology, multi-policy approach, we quantify the complex interplay between the diffusion of individual technologies, several interacting policies and systemic challenges. Our results show that California's policy status quo initiated a BS uptake and, in turn, a flattening of the system, but, in the long run, will increase the electricity prices. To avoid this, we outline a policy reorientation-including a gradual phase-out of the prevailing feed-in remuneration and an introduction of fixed charges for owners of solar photovoltaic systems. Our results imply that the policy debate should be re-focused away from a single-technology single-policy perspective towards a system integration perspective. Neglecting this could not only jeopardize the affordability of electricity and climate change mitigation plans, but also put at risk the reliability of the electricity supply system. With investment costs of renewables expected to continue to decrease, this further implies that even countries without public support for renewables are likely to face challenges associated with their integration.

J	Hamilton, I; Patel, N				Hamilton, Ian; Patel, Nisarg			Nuclear Batteries for Maritime Applications	MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL			English	Article								The large size of the ocean stretches the capability of conventional power sources beyond their limits. Chemical batteries simply do not have enough energy density to power underwater unmanned vehicles (UUVs) for hundreds of miles or oceanic sensors for months on end. Wave and solar energy harvesters are traditionally limited to the surface and cannot provide power to deep water devices. A new type of power supply must be developed if the deep oceans are to be completely mapped and explored. One source of energy that has the power density needed is that of the radioisotope power supply or nuclear battery. This concept draws on the benefits of nuclear power in batteries-just like nuclear submarines use nuclear reactors. Nuclear batteries have energy densities thousands of times greater than chemical cells and can provide power nonstop for months to centuries, depending on the isotope used. Radioisotope batteries do not suffer from the temperature and pressure limitations that conventional batteries do. However, current nuclear battery designs are far too expensive for commercial use and are limited to high-profile applications like space power. A new type of nuclear power supply needs to be developed in order to completely take advantage of radioisotope battery benefits. The authors are developing such a system that makes use of the thermionic energy conversion to create an efficient, cost-effective, and safe nuclear battery, specifically for oceanic applications.

We formulate the problem in a bilevel framework, using particle swarm optimization to determine investment and the DER-CAM model (Distributed Energy Resources Customer Adoption Model) to determine operation. The model further uses sequential Monte Carlo simulation to explicitly simulate power outages and integrates time-varying customer damage functions to calculate interruption costs from outages. The model treats nonlinearities in reliability evaluation directly, where existing linear models make critical simplifying assumptions. It combines investment, operating, and interruption costs together in a single objective function, thereby treating reliability endogenously and finding the cost-optimal trade-off between cost and reliability-two competing objectives. In bench-marking against a version of the DER-CAM model that treats reliability through a constraint on minimum investment, our new model improves estimates of reliability (the loss of load expectation) by up to 600%, of the total system cost by 6%-18%, of the investment cost by 32%-50%, and of the economic benefit of investing 27%-47%. Improvements stem from large differences in investment of up to 56% for natural gas generators, solar photovoltaics, and battery energy storage.

Bi-Facial Substrates Enabled Heterogeneous Multi-Dimensional Integrated Circuits (MD-IC) for Internet of Things (IoT) Applications	ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS			English	Article						integrated circuit; internet of things; packaging; silicon; through-silicon-via	SYSTEM; WIRELESS; MICRO	The primary focus of modern electronics technology is to increase its functionalities within a smaller footprint at an affordable cost. This creates a new set of design challenges for the already-existing complex integration and packaging schemes. Here, CMOS-compatible and heterogeneous multi-dimensional integrated circuits (MD-IC) as smart electronic systems for Internet of Things (IoT) applications are shown. Both sides of bulk monocrystalline Si (100) substrate for device fabrication which are connected via through-silicon-via to transform it into bi-facial CMOS electronics system are used. As a proof-of-concept, cubic, pyramidal, and buckyball shaped MD-ICs, with broad variety of devices including humidity, temperature, pressure, and pH sensors, solar cells, antenna, microcontroller, light emitting diode and micro lithium-ion battery are shown. In these MD-ICs, adjacent sides are interconnected through side-interlocks. It is also shown that polymeric encapsulation and heterogeneous materials (Si, Ge, and GaSb) can be integrated in the MD-IC architecture to meet the rigorous requirements of IoT devices. Compared to folded rigid or flexible Printed Circuit Board based electronics, this report shows unprecedented usage of area by device fabrication on both sides which are also connected through-silicon-via as state-of-the-art tool for 3D-IC manufacturing.

Herein, a self-powered and fully integrated smartwatch that consists of flexible photovoltaic cells and rechargeable batteries in the forms of a "watch strap", electrochemical glucose sensors, customized circuits, and display units integrated into a "dial" platform is successfully fabricated for real-time and continuous monitoring of sweat glucose levels. The functionality of the smartwatch, including sweat glucose sensing, signal processing, and display, can be supported with the harvested/converted solar energy without external charging devices. The Zn-MnO2 batteries serve as intermediate energy storage units and the utilization of aqueous electrolytes eliminated safety concerns for batteries, which is critical for wearable devices. Such a wearable system in a smartwatch fashion realizes integration of energy modules with self-powered capability, electrochemical sensors for noninvasive glucose monitoring, and in situ and real-time signal processing/display in a single platform for the first time. The as-fabricated fully integrated and self-powered smartwatch also provides a promising protocol for statistical study and clinical investigation to reveal correlations between sweat compositions and human body dynamics.

Assessing Solar Power for Globally Migrating Marine and Submarine Systems	IEEE JOURNAL OF OCEANIC ENGINEERING			English	Article						Marine technology; predictive models; solar energy; telemetry	PERFORMANCE; IRRADIANCE; CELLS	Remote marine sensing systems, such as autonomous underwater vehicles or telemetry tags, can be limited in data collection and deployment duration due to the finite energy of the onboard battery. With these technologies migrating vast distances over long-term deployments, maintaining high data resolution is difficult and often yields nonideal data sets. Furthermore, electronics systems used in telemetry tags are often potted in epoxy, which makes replacing or recharging the battery impractical. The implementation of solar energy harvesting on these technologies could increase the fidelity of collected data and/ or tag longevity. This paper presents an assessmentmodel that estimates the energy output of a stationary or migrating solar cell above or below the ocean's surface. The theory and assumptions behind the model are explained, including a review of established concepts for the purpose of consolidation and variable consistency. The model is then compared to benchmark data for verification. Finally, a preliminary analysis is conducted on the previously collected time, depth, and global location data froma northern elephant seal deployment to demonstrate the resulting model outputs and how they can be used for analysis in future works.

In this work, two kinds of metal-organic framework (MOF) derivatives, NiO/Co3O4 microcubes and Fe2O3 microleaves, are prepared via thermal treatment and assembled into electrochemical capacitors, which deliver a relatively high specific energy density of 46 Wh kg(-1) at 690 W kg(-1). In addition, a solar-charging power system consisting of the electrochemical capacitors and monocrystalline silicon plates is fabricated and a motor fan or 25 LEDs for 5 and 30 min, respectively, is powered. This work not only adds two novel materials to the growing categories of MOF-derived advanced materials, but also successfully achieves an efficient solar-ECs system for the first time based on all MOF derivatives, which has a certain reference for developing efficient solar-charge systems.

Concurrently, sustainability concerns of fossil-based energy resources have motivated the use of renewable and reusable energy resources, and the use of more efficient energy-converting and energy-consuming systems. Consequently, for the past decade, there have been major theoretical and experimental advances in (1) energy generation from renewable and reusable resources and (2) energy-consuming and energy-converting devices. This review article focuses on the recent theoretical advances in renewable energy conversion devices such as photovoltaic and fuel cells, and in energy storage devices such as rechargeable batteries, flow batteries, and supercapacitors. Due to similar chemistry, electrochemistry, and physics of these systems, modeling similarities between different energy systems are highlighted. This review puts into perspective how first-principles mathematical modeling has contributed to systematic advances in the optimal design, operation, and integration of these systems.

New Temporal and Spectral Unfiltering Technique for ERBE/ERBS WFOV Nonscanner Instrument Observations	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Data conversion; earth; energy measurements	RADIATION BUDGET EXPERIMENT; EARTH RADIATION; DECADAL VARIABILITY; CALIBRATION; RADIANCES; CLOUDS	Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) Wide-Field-of-View (WFOV) nonscanner instrument onboard Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) provided critical 15-year outgoing broadband irradiances at the top of atmosphere (TOA) from 1985 to 1999 for studying Earth's climate. However, earlier studies show that the uncertainty in this radiation data set (Ed3) is significantly higher after the Mt. Pinatubo eruption in 1991 and satellite battery issue in 1993. Further-more, Lee et al. showed that the transmission of ERBS WFOV shortwave dome degraded due to exposure to direct sunlight. To account for this degradation, a simple time-dependent but spectral-independent correction model was implemented in the past. This simple spectral-independent model did not completely remove the shortwave sensor artifact as seen in the temporal growth of the tropical mean day-minus-night longwave irradiance. A new temporal-spectral-dependent correction model of shortwave dome transmissivity loss similar to that used in the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) project is developed and applied to the 15-year ERBS WFOV data. This model is constrained by the solar transmission obtained from ERBS WFOV shortwave nonscanner instrument observations of the Sun during biweekly in-flight solar calibration events. This new model is able to reduce the reported tropical day-minusnight longwave irradiance trend by approximate to 34%. In addition, the slope of this new trend is observed to be consistent over different regions. The remaining trend is accounted using a postprocess Ed3Rev1 correction. Furthermore, the time series analysis of these data over the Libya-4 desert site showed that the shortwave data are stable to within 0.7%.

J	Cai, HR; Cao, Q; Jiang, H				Cai, Haoran; Cao, Qiang; Jiang, Hong			A Renewable Energy Driven Approach for Computational Sprinting	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Computational sprinting; green data center; renewable energy; energy efficiency		Computational Sprinting, which allows a chip to exceed its power and thermal limits temporarily by turning on all processor cores and absorbing the extra heat dissipation with certain phase-changing materials, has proven to be an effective way to boost the computing performance for bursty workloads. However, extra power available for sprinting is constrained by existing power distribution infrastructures. Using batteries alone to provide the additional power to achieve performance target not only limits the effectiveness of sprinting, but also negatively impacts the lifetime of the batteries. Leveraging renewable power supply in a green data center provides an opportunity to make full use of Computational Sprinting. However, the intermittent nature of renewable energy, along with limited cooling capacity, makes it very challenging. In this paper, we propose GreenSprint, a renewable energy driven approach that enables a data center to boost its computing performance efficiently by conducting computational sprinting under the intermittent and time-varying nature of renewable energy supply. Three basic strategies are designed to determine the core count and frequency level for sprinting based on current power supply. Furthermore, we propose a Hybrid strategy that combines reinforcement learning to dynamically determine the optimal server setting, targeting at both the power provision safety and the quality of service. In consideration of practical cooling conditions, we also present a thermal-aware sprinting strategy Hybrid-T. Finally, we build an experimental prototype to evaluate GreenSprint on a cluster of 10 servers with a simulated solar power generator. The results show that renewable energy by itself can sustain different duration lengths of sprinting when its supply is sufficient and can improve performance by up to 4.8x for representative interactive applications. We also show the effectiveness of core-count and frequency scaling in the presence of varied renewable power and limited battery energy.

To understand the effect of sharing distributed generation, we developed two energy sharing models: 1) a welfare optimization, and 2) a game theoretical (bi-level) model. We introduced two type players: 1) the owner of distributed generation (e.g., solar PV and energy storage), and 2) the consumers. Furthermore, we included consumer preferences by multiple objectives such as emissions reduction and distributed generation in addition to cost in the model. We applied both models to a numerical example using data from the electricity market in Texas, USA. The results showed that welfare is maximized in both models, but shared differently between the owner of the generation and the consumers. One exception is the hi-level model with uniform price auctions which results in a reduction in system welfare to maximize owner revenues.

In this paper, we examine the reliability values of distributed solar+storage systems considering their possibility of survival during or rapid deployment after a rare weather event. To this end, we develop a theoretical basis and rule-of-thumb formulas for estimating the reliability value of a solar+storage system. The analytical results are used to calculate the optimal solar+storage capacities when reliability values are considered on top of the economic values and investment costs. Furthermore, to improve the accuracy of the proposed reliability value, we introduce a data-driven correction term based on realistic simulations using hourly electric load from 600 households in Austin, Texas, USA. Case studies demonstrate that 50% of households can achieve over $196.55 in annual reliability values by installing a solar+storage system with typical capacities. Combining our theoretical model with empirical data, we obtain an approach for fast yet accurate evaluation of the reliability value of solar+storage systems while avoiding the need for complex simulations. Therefore, our proposed theoretical analysis enables unsophisticated individual consumers to gauge the reliability benefits of distributed solar+storage systems amidst rare weather events when making an investment decision.

Many approaches have been used to analyze voltage stability but an approach that can directly indicate the closeness of power system to voltage collapse can be used to optimally plan for the improvement of the power system voltage stability condition when compensation devices are to be deployed. In this study, optimal active and reactive power compensation was performed on a continuously loaded power system, using the battery energy storage system (BESS). In order to achieve this, a voltage stability evaluation model which contains information concerning the active and reactive power flow along the transmission line was adopted. The BESS is considered as a combination of storage units and voltage source converter (VSC) in order to facilitate independent control of both the active and reactive injection to the grid. The optimal control of the output of the BESS minimizes its installed capacity and consequently, reduced the cost as shown by simulation on the IEEE 14 bus system.

A hybrid system that integrates and optimizes across solar photovoltaic and complementary energy sources, such as wind and diesel generation, can improve reliability, and reduce the unit cost of power production. This study assesses the potential of a hybrid system to electrify a remote rural village in Ethiopia. The Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Electric Renewables model is used to assess primary data, develop a load profile and identify the optimal least-cost system option for the village. A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the effect of variations in solar radiation, wind speed, and diesel price on optimal system configurations. The results show that a hybrid system with a combination of photovoltaic array, wind turbine, battery and diesel generator is the best option from an economic point of view. To meet the village's daily peak demand of 19.6 kW, energy generation cost is estimated at 0.207 dollars per kilowatt hour and net present cost at 82,734 dollars. The optimal system allows for a reduction of 37.3 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year compared with diesel-only electricity generation. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Spray pyrolysis (SP), which is particularly facile, effective, highly scalable and suitable for on-line continuous production, offers significant potential for the rational design and synthesis of various functional nanostructured materials with tailorable composition and morphology. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in various functional nanostructured materials synthesized by SP and their potential applications in energy storage and conversion. After a brief introduction to the equipment, components, and working principles of the SP technique, we thoroughly describe the guidelines and strategies for designing particles with controlled morphology, composition, and interior architecture, including hollow structures, dense spheres, yolk-shell structures, core-shell structures, nanoplates, nanorods, nanowires, thin films, and various nanocomposites. Thereafter, we demonstrate their suitability for a wide range of energy storage and conversion applications, including electrode materials for rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors, highly active catalysts for hydrogen production, carbon dioxide reduction and fuel cells, and photoelectric materials for solar cells. Finally, the potential advantages and challenges of SP for the preparation of nanostructured materials are particularly emphasized and discussed, and several perspectives on future research and development directions of SP are highlighted. We expect that this continuous, onepot, and controllable synthetic technology can serve as a reference for preparing various advanced functional materials for broader applications.

Although battery-and carbon-based routes have gained tremendous attention, nitrogen-based routes have rarely been exploited so far. Guanidine (CH5N3) which contains 71.1% nitrogen by mass is an exemplary chemical to explore the nitrogen-based routes of energy utilization and storage. Guanidine has a variety of applications including its use as a slow-release fertilizer, a propellant, or as a precursor to pharmaceuticals and antimicrobial polymers. The conventional chemical synthesis of guanidine through the Frank-Caro process is energy-intensive, consumes fossil fuels, and is detrimental to the environment. Herein, a de novo guanidine biosynthesis (GUB) cycle is proposed with CO2 and nitrate/ammonium as the carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively. The ATP and NAD(P)H needed to drive the GUB cycle are generated via photosynthesis in an engineered cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 expressing an ethylene-forming enzyme (EFE). Up to 586.5 mg L-1 (9.9 mM) guanidine was produced after seven days of photoautotrophic cultivation, with an average productivity of 83.8 mg L-1 day(-1). In addition, guanidine was directly biosynthesized from CO2, N-2 and H2O in an engineered N-2-fixing cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 expressing the EFE. This work demonstrates the first biological conversion of renewable solar energy into chemical energy stored in the nitrogen-rich compound guanidine, which could shed light on harnessing the biological nitrogen metabolism for energy utilization and storage.

Graphene is widely applied in the field of energy such as in batteries, supercapacitors, and solar cells. The properties of graphene can be further improved by making nanocomposites with conducting polymers. In this work, graphene oxide nanoribbons (GONRs) were synthesized by unzipping multiwall carbon nanotubes. Graphene nanoribbons were used to make nanocomposites with polypyrrole for energy storage applications. The synthesized nanocomposites were structurally and electrochemically characterized to understand their structure and electrochemical properties. The electrochemical characterizations of these nanocomposites were carried out using cyclic voltammetry. The specific capacitance of the nanocomposites was observed to decrease with increasing scan rates. The highest specific capacitance of 2066 F/g was observed using cyclic voltammetry for the optimized nanocomposite of GONR and polypyrrole. Our study suggests that the electrochemical properties of graphene or polypyrrole can be improved by making their composites and that they could be successfully used as electrode materials for energy storage applications. This study can also be extended to the self-assembly of other conducting polymers and graphene nanoribbons through a simple route for various other applications.

All printable snow-based triboelectric nanogenerator	NANO ENERGY			English	Article						All printable; Snow-triboelectrification; Arctic; Energy harvesting; Self-powered; Weather station; Wearables	ICE; ELECTRIFICATION; TRANSPARENT; ENERGY	The development of power generators that can function in harsh snowy environments and in contact with snow can be beneficial but challenging to accomplish. Herein, we introduce the first snow-based triboelectric nano-generator (snow-TENG) that can be used as an energy harvester and a multifunctional sensor based on the principle of snow-triboelectrification. In this work, we used a 3D printing technique for the precise design and deposition of the electrode and triboelectric layer, leading to flexible, stretchable and metal-free triboelectric generators. Based on the single electrode mode, the device can generate an instantaneous output power density as high as 0.2 mW/m(2), an open circuit voltage up to 8 V, and a current density of 40 mu A/m(2). In addition, the snow-TENG can function as a miniaturized weather station to monitor the weather in real time to provide accurate information about the snowfall rate, snow accumulation depth, wind direction, and speed in snowy and/or icy environments. In addition, the snow-TENG can be used as a wearable power source and biomechanical sensor to detect human body motions, which may prove useful for snow-related sports. Unlike conventional sensor platforms, our design works without the need for batteries or image processing systems. We envision these devices could potentially be integrated into solar panels to ensure continuous power supply during snowy weather conditions.

Module efficiency is found to be limited by perimeter recombination for individual cells and shunt leakage for the series-connected module configuration. We utilize GaAs and AlGaAs junction barrier isolation between interconnected cells to dramatically reduce shunt leakage current. A photovoltaic module with eight series-connected cells and total area of 1.27 mm(2) demonstrates a power conversion efficiency of greater than 26% under low-flux near-infrared illumination (850 nm at 1 mu W/mm(2)). The output voltage of the module is greater than 5 V, providing a voltage up-conversion efficiency of more than 90%.

However, these devices, associated controllers, and uncertainty in RE output could bring new challenges to power system stability, especially oscillatory stability. Hence, the integration of battery energy storage systems (BESSs) is being developed to minimise the uncertainty and variability in renewables. Furthermore, to tackle the complex dynamics and inertia-less characteristics of wind and PV plants additional controllers such as power oscillation damping (POD) control and virtual inertia scheme are sought. However, the primary challenges associated with the wide-area oscillation damping controller are signal transmission delay, loss of communication signal, data drops, and others. This paper proposes a bat algorithm (BA) based resilient wide-area multi-mode controller (MMC) for enhancing oscillatory stability margin with high penetration of renewable power generations (RPGs) and BESSs. The Java 500 kV Indonesian grid is used to evaluate the performance of the resilient wide-area MMC. From the results, it is found that the proposed controller effectively damp the critical mode of oscillation in the system even under communication failure as well as certain damping controller failures.

For plug-in electric vehicles, direct-current fast charging (DCFC) is proposed as a solution to support long-distance travel and relieve range anxiety. However, DCFC has also been shown to be potentially more expensive compared to residential or workplace charging. In particular, electricity demand charges can significantly impact electricity cost for fast charging applications. Here we explore technological solutions that can help reduce the electricity cost for electric vehicle fast charging. In particular, we consider thousands of electricity rates available in the United States and real-world vehicle charging load scenarios to assess opportunities to reduce the cost of DCFC by deploying solar photovoltaics (PV) panels and energy storage (battery), and implementing a co-location configuration where a DCFC station is connected to an existing meter within a commercial building. Results show that while the median electricity cost across more than 7000 commercial retail rates remains less than $0.20/kWh for all charging load scenarios considered, cost varies greatly, and some locations do experience significantly higher electricity cost. Co-location is almost always economically viable to mitigate fixed cost and demand charges, but the relative benefit of co-locating diminishes as station size and utilization increase. Energy storage alone can help mitigate demand charges and is more effective at reducing costs for "peaky" or low-utilization loads. On the other hand, PV systems primarily help mitigate energy charges, and are more effective for loads that are more correlated with solar production, even in areas with lower solar resource. PV and energy storage can deploy synergistically to provide cost reductions for DCFC, leveraging their ability to mitigate demand and energy charges.

However, optimization algorithms must take into account the underlying dynamics and uncertainties of the various interconnected subsystems in order to fully realize this potential. To this end, we formulate and solve an energy management optimization problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) consisting of battery storage dynamics, a stochastic demand model, a stochastic solar generation model, and an electricity pricing scheme. The stochastic model for predicting solar generation is constructed based on weather forecast data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. A near-optimal policy design is proposed via stochastic dynamic programming. Simulation results are presented in the context of storage and solar-integrated residential and commercial building environments. Results indicate that the near-optimal policy significantly reduces the operating costs compared to several heuristic alternatives. The proposed framework facilitates the design and evaluation of energy management policies with configurable demand-supply-storage parameters in the presence of Weather-induced uncertainties.

The as-prepared ZnO sphere is composed of oriented assembled primary crystals, which exhibits single crystal nature with narrow pore size distribution and high surface area. In addition, time depending trails indicate the metal organic framework functions as reservoir to control the release of Zn species and the organic molecules also serve as directing regent to facilitate the oriented assembling of the ZnO primary units. Thanks to this structure coherence, the ZnO sphere delivers high electron mobility, which enables reduced carrier recombination and improved collection efficiency of the photoelectrons when used as photoanode in CdS/CdSe sensitized solar cell. The device achieves a high power conversion efficiency of similar to 6.20%, which is substantially improved from that of regular ZnO nanoparticles (similar to 5.02%). Moreover, when evaluated as anode for lithium ion battery, the ZnO sphere based electrode demonstrates high reversible capacity of 1016.7 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) after 100 cycles, and excellent high rate stability which shows impressive reversible capacity of 698.4 mA h g(-1) at 1000 mA g (-1) after 300 cycles.

Here, we propose a metric for the cost of energy storage and for identifying optimally sized storage systems. The levelized cost of energy storage is the minimum price per kWh that a potential investor requires in order to break even over the entire lifetime of the storage facility. We forecast the dynamics of this cost metric in the context of lithium-ion batteries and demonstrate its usefulness in identifying an optimally sized battery charged by an incumbent solar PV system. Applying the model to residential solar customers in Germany, we find that behind-the-meter storage is economically viable because of the large difference between retail rates and current feed-in tariffs. In contrast, investment incentives for battery systems in California derive principally from a state-level subsidy program.

Several islands in the archipelago have suitable wind and solar resources and nationally these compose about 25% of the electricity output. However, not all islands are equally endowed with these resources and the lack of grid connections among islands poses challenges for integrating additional variable energy generation. Integrating desalination and storage (pumped hydro or battery) could enable greater penetration of wind and solar energy. Ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) is an emerging technology that could be suitable for Cape Verde. Microgrids and self-generation could prove to be more cost effective than grid connections outside of the large cities. Achieving the 100% renewable energy goal would require a US$1 billion investment. Cape Verde has a variety of resources that can contribute to achieving its 100% renewable electricity goal but combining them in manageable and cost-effective way remains a challenge. The options, opportunities, and challenges encountered by Cape Verde are applicable to other countries, especially small island developing states and archipelagos around the world.

The design method utilizes multiobjective optimization with the genetic algorithm considering four parameters that characterize solar power based microgrids (battery voltage, photovoltaic (PV) maximum power, PV maximum power point voltage, and number of panels per string). The final optimization metric is the ratio of daily average deliverable power to total system mass (W/kg) metric. The microgrid system is composed of a number of modular dc-dc microconverters, of which four topologies (buck, boost, buck-boost, and non-inverting buck-boost) are evaluated and compared. The non-inverting buck-boost converter is determined to be the best candidate, and the optimal system characteristics are provided and analyzed. The final system design achieves a specific power of 35.56 W/kg, with optimized result of 743.7 V battery voltage, 439.5 W PV maximum power, 182.7 V PV maximum voltage, and three panels per string. Based on the optimizations results, a prototype is designed, tested, and analyzed in terms of efficiency and low-temperature reliability. The converter achieved a peak efficiency of 98.4%, a power density of 3.54 W/cm(3), a specific power of 3.76 W/g, and operated for over 267 h of 11-min low-temperature cycles from 0 to -140 degrees C.

J	Kurland, SD; Benson, S				Kurland, Simon Davidsson; Benson, SallyM.			The energetic implications of introducing lithium-ion batteries into distributed photovoltaic systems	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS			English	Article							SELF-CONSUMPTION; INVESTED EROEI; SOLAR-SYSTEMS; PAYBACK TIME; STORAGE; RETURN; PV; TRANSITION; FOOTPRINT; REGIONS	Batteries for stationary applications can prove to be crucial for enabling high penetration of solar energy, but production and use of batteries comes with an energetic cost. This study quantifies how adding a lithiumion (Li-ion) battery affects the energetic performance of a typical residential photovoltaic (PV) system under a wide range of climatic conditions. If all generated power is either self-consumed or made available via an existing distribution grid, the PV system will have an energy return on investment (EROI) of between 14 (Alaska) and 27 (Arizona). While adding a 12 kW h Li-ion battery increases self-consumption considerably, this has a negative effect of decreasing the EROI by more than 20%. In a situation where all excess power generation is curtailed, the EROI can be as low as 7 (Alaska and Washington), although it can also be as high as 15 (Florida). Introducing a battery increases the EROI but it is still considerably lower than in cases where excess power generation is added to the grid. Doubling the battery size increases the average self-consumption marginally, but further decreases the EROI of the system because the extra energy invested to build the additional battery is used inefficiently. The results show that installing PV systems in locations with good solar resources and a grid that can accept excess production is desirable for maximizing the net energy return from distributed PV systems. Batteries have a benefit when excess electricity generation cannot be fed into the grid. Oversizing batteries has the effect of significantly reducing the EROI of the PV system.

A multi-scenario life cycle impact comparison of operational energy supply techniques for an office building in Thailand	ENERGY AND BUILDINGS			English	Article						Life cycle assessment; Environmental impact; Energy intensity; Office building; Thailand; Solar energy; Lithium-ion battery; Thermal energy storage	SYSTEMS; PERFORMANCE; BATTERIES; STORAGE; RATES; SOLAR	This study provides a life cycle assessment (LCA) of a sustainably designed office building to be built in Thailand. The building has a gross floor area of 6300 m(2) and a lifetime of 50 years. An analysis of four different energy supply scenarios was performed to evaluate methods for reducing grid electricity demand with the goal of optimizing renewable energy usage and minimizing environmental impacts. The scenarios included: (1) the conventional, grid-dependent building, followed by (2) the addition of a rooftop photovoltaic (PV) system, (3) a PV system with lithium-ion battery storage, and (4) a PV system with an ice storage system. Scenarios 3 and 4 were included in this study as 16% of the electricity from PV was overproduced during the weekends when the building was unoccupied. The results show that scenarios 2, 3, and 4 reduced operational grid consumption by 33%, 37.8%, and 37.9% but increased metal depletion potential by 23.9%, 34.4%, and 29.0%, respectively. Ice storage led to the greatest reduction in lifetime environmental impacts. Efficient production and utilization of renewable energy in buildings is vital to reducing nonrenewable fuel dependence: however, it is necessary to minimize metal depletion in the implementation of such technologies.

Economic and resilience benefit analysis of incorporating battery storage to photovoltaic array generation	RENEWABLE ENERGY			English	Article						Photovoltaic power island system; Solar power storage; System design optimization; Resilient power systems; Resilience; Battery backup systems	SIZING METHODOLOGIES; SYSTEMS; ENERGY; POWER; MODEL; COST; OPTIMIZATION; DEFINITION; DESIGN	Power systems with photovoltaic (PV) arrays combined with battery backup storage are becoming increasingly used because of their capability of working in power island mode, especially during grid outages. The problem is to decide the optimal battery sizes for PV + battery systems with given solar array sizes, from both power supply reliability and economical perspectives. An optimization method based on the simulation of system operation during grid interruption is developed to investigate the effects of battery size on system output reliability level of meeting load demand with minimum cost. Case studies are conducted for validation according to actual solar irradiation data, load profiles and realistic power interruption statistics. Sensitivity analysis is also performed to explore how system total cost affects islanding capability of a PV + battery system to supply energy to facilities. The finding shows that the decline of battery price not only reduces the lowest system total cost but also improves islanded system generation reliability. The proposed methodology for optimizing battery capacity added to PV array systems can make them grid-outage resilient and economically viable, which can be utilized as a decision-making tool for future PV + battery system expansion.

A techno-economic comparison of storage technologies in California	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Flow battery; Behind-the-meter; Commercial customers	ENERGY-STORAGE; OPTIMIZATION; EMISSIONS; SYSTEMS	Flow batteries have different performance characteristics than established storage technologies such as lithiumion and lead-acid. We model advanced lead-acid, lithium-ion, and flow batteries for commercial and industrial customers under various tariff scenarios providing retail and wholesale market services to determine if flow batteries can compete in the retail market. We find that flow batteries are uncompetitive with lithium-ion and lead-acid batteries across a range of use cases and modelling assumptions. Flow batteries at a 4-h duration must be less expensive than their competitors on a dollar per installed kWh basis, often by 20-30%, to break even with shorter duration li-ion or lead-acid despite allowing for deeper depth of discharge and superior cycle life. Our results are robust to assumptions of tariff rates, battery round-trip efficiencies, amount of solar generation and whether the battery can participate in the wholesale energy and ancillary services markets.

Due to their diverse physicochemical properties and favourable attributes, such as quantum confinement effects and abundant surface defects, CDs and their derived hybrids have shown exciting and indispensable prospects in the energy conversion and storage fields. Considering the latest developments, in this review, we comprehensively summarize the classification and structure of CDs. Three strategies for structural engineering of CDs are presented and analyzed, in terms of the tuning of size and crystallinity, and the methodologies for surface modification and heteroatom doping, with a focus on the relationship among the synthesis methods, structure and properties of the concerned CDs. More importantly, the recent advances in energy-oriented applications of CDs, including photo-and electro-catalysis, light-emitting diodes, photovoltaic cells, lithium/ sodium ion batteries and supercapacitors, will be systematically highlighted. Finally, we discuss and outline the remaining major challenges and opportunities for CDs in the future.

The fully autonomous off-grid solar thermal water heating system was packaged by integrating solar thermal collector, phase change material tank, photovoltaic modules, operational controller, circulation pumps and battery, along with a data logger. A water-glycol with anti-freeze characteristics with efficient energy storage in cold weather was employed as heat transfer fluid for solar thermal energy harvesting for charging and discharging of phase change materials to heat the water tank. Solar charge-discharge and water charging results with phase change materials during May to October 2018 (Mesa, AZ 85212, USA) showed that the stearic acid/palmitic acid eutectic mixture outperformed the paraffin wax and exhibited comparable performance with puretemp68 storage system. The efficiency of water charging from stearic acid/palmitic acid (55%) is higher compared to that from paraffin wax (20%) and better than puretemp68 (45%). Even though, the paraffin wax melts quickly during charging, it exhibited super-cooling behavior during discharging, leading to incomplete discharge. The storage energy density of stearic acid/palmitic acid (similar to 0.48 MJ kg(-1)) is comparable to puretemp68 with uniform thermal energy distribution inside the storage container due to higher thermal conductivity and lower melting point. The solar thermal water heating system demonstration proved that the domestic hot water system using stearic acid/palmitic acid could be a practical solution for effectively harvesting solar thermal energy for rural areas.

Due to the intermittent nature of major renewable sources like wind and solar, storage technologies will be critical in the future power grid to accommodate fluctuating generation. The storage systems will need to decouple supply and demand by shifting electrical energy on many different time scales (hourly, daily, and seasonally). Power-to-Gas can contribute on all of these time scales by producing hydrogen via electrolysis during times of excess electrical generation, and generating power with high-efficiency systems like fuel cells when wind and solar are not sufficiently available. Despite lower immediate round-trip efficiency compared to most battery storage systems, the combination of devices used in Power-to-Gas allows independent scaling of power and energy capacities to enable massive and long duration storage. This study develops and applies a model to simulate the power system balance at very high penetration of re-newables. Novelty of the study is the assessment of hydrogen as the primary storage means for balancing energy supply and demand on a large scale: the California power system is analyzed to estimate the needs for electrolyzer and fuel cell systems in 100% renewable scenarios driven by large additions of wind and solar capacities. Results show that the transition requires a massive increase in both generation and storage installations, e.g., a combination of 94 GW of solar PV, 40 GW of wind, and 77 GW of electrolysis systems. A mix of generation technologies appears to reduce the total required capacities with respect to wind-dominated or solar-dominated cases. Hydrogen storage capacity needs are also evaluated and possible alternatives are discussed, including a comparison with battery storage systems. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

A design framework for realizing multifunctional wings for flapping wing air vehicles using solar cells	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MICRO AIR VEHICLES			English	Article						High-efficiency solar cells; flapping wing air vehicles; multifunctional wings; energy generation modeling; solar flux analysis	HOVERING INSECT FLIGHT; AERODYNAMICS; LIFT; MECHANISMS; COMPLIANT; THRUST; BIRDS; DRAG	Long flight durations are highly desirable to expand mission capabilities for unmanned air systems and autonomous applications in particular. Flapping wing aerial vehicles are unmanned air system platforms offering several performance advantages over fixed wing and rotorcraft platforms, but are unable to reach comparable flight times when powered by batteries. One solution to this problem has been to integrate energy harvesting technologies in components, such as wings. To this end, a framework for designing flapping wing aerial vehicle using multifunctional wings using solar cells is described. This framework consists of: (1) modeling solar energy harvesting while flying, (2) determining the number of solar cells that meet flight power requirements, and (3) determining appropriate locations to accommodate the desired number of solar cells. A system model for flapping flight was also developed to predict payload capacity for carrying batteries to provide energy only for power spikes and to enable time-to-land safely in an area where batteries can recharge when the sun sets. The design framework was applied to a case study using flexible high-efficiency (>24%) solar cells on a flapping wing aerial vehicle platform, known as Robo Raven IIIv5, with the caveat that a powertrain with 81% efficiency is used in place of the current servos. A key finding was the fraction of solar flux incident on the wings during flapping was 0.63 at the lowest solar altitude. Using a 1.25 safety factor, the lowest value for the purposes of design will be 0.51. Wind tunnel measurements and aerodynamic modeling of the platform determined integrating solar cells in the wings resulted in a loss of thrust and greater drag, but the resulting payload capacity was unaffected because of a higher lift coefficient. A time-to-land of 2500 s was predicted, and the flight capability of the platform was validated in a netted test facility.

J	Shui, HY; Jin, XN; Ni, J				Shui, Huanyi; Jin, Xiaoning; Ni, Jun			Twofold Variation Propagation Modeling and Analysis for Roll-to-Roll Manufacturing Systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Manufacturing system modeling; multistage systems; roll-to-roll (R2R) processes	DIMENSIONAL ERRORS; STREAM	Roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing has emerged as one of the most cost-effective manufacturing techniques for high-volume production of flexible printing electronics, graphene films, thin-film batteries, and solar cells, as opposed to low-volume batch production. However, in practice, real-time monitoring of the R2R process and in situ measurement of fabricated materials during production are challenging because of the high speed and dynamic variation of the web. In addition, due to the lack of cost-effective sensors and in-line metrology systems with a large range and high resolution, effective quality control and defect diagnosis are difficult to achieve. To address these challenges, this paper aims to develop analytical models that can serve as virtual sensing and metrology tools to quantify process state variation and estimate product quality in R2R processes with limited accessibility of in situ sensor. First, the quality variation propagation mechanism in R2R processes is investigated. Second, a hybrid multistage modeling method is proposed to characterize the twofold variation propagation-product-centric and process-centric variations, and its relationship with product quality in R2R processes. Note to Practitioners-The novel modeling method developed in this paper employs both physics-based analysis (e.g., web handling system dynamics) and regression methods [e.g., censored regression and linear/logistic regression (LG)] using multisensor signals. The estimation results from the model can serve as virtual sensing and virtual metrology tools to increase the system visibility and be applied for process monitoring and error detection in real time. A print registration unit of elastic film in a roll-to-roll system is employed to demonstrate and validate the proposed modeling method in terms of the accuracy of state estimates and quality prediction. Based on the comparison results, the hybrid modeling method shows higher accuracy in state estimation and quality prediction than do the models with data-driven methods only.

Energies of Adsorbed Catalytic Intermediates on Transition Metal Surfaces: Calorimetric Measurements and Benchmarks for Theory	ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH			English	Review							DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL THEORY; DISSOCIATIVE ADSORPTION; FORMIC-ACID; NIO(111) ENERGETICS; METHYL-IODIDE; BOND-ENERGIES; PT(111); NI(111); HEAT; MICROCALORIMETRY	CONSPECTUS: Better catalysts and electrocatalysts are essential for the production and use of clean fuels with less pollution and improved energy efficiency, for making chemicals with less energy and environmental impact, for pollution abatement, and for many other future technologies needed to achieve environmentally friendlier energy supply and chemicals industry. Crucial for rational design of better catalyst and electrocatalyst materials is knowledge of the energies of elementary chemical reactions on late transition metal surfaces. This knowledge would also aid in designing more efficient and stable photocatalysts and batteries for harvesting and storing solar energy. These are all crucial for sustainable living with high quality. Herein, I review measurements of surface reaction energies involving many of the most common adsorbates formed as intermediates on late transition metal surfaces in catalytic and electrocatalytic reactions of interest for energy and environmental technologies. I focus on calorimetric measurements of the heat of molecular and dissociative adsorption of gases on single crystals (i.e., single crystal adsorption calorimetry, or SCAC) that allow the heats of formation of adsorbed intermediates in well-defined structures to be directly determined. Adsorption reactions are often irreversible, and in such cases SCAC is required to get these heats, since the other methods for measuring adsorption energies (equilibrium adsorption isotherms and temperature-programmed desorption) work only for reversible adsorption. Common examples of irreversible adsorption reactions are ones that produce adsorbed molecular fragments or adsorbed molecules such as olefins and aromatic molecules that bind very strongly to non-noble metals. When the heats of formation of different adsorbed molecular fragments are compared to each other, and to their values on different metal surfaces, they reveal which properties of the metal surface and the molecular fragments determine metal-adsorbate bond strengths, and clarify differences in catalytic reactivity between different metals. When combined with earlier adsorption energy measurements, these heats also provide a database of reliable energies of adsorbed catalytic intermediates that serve as crucial benchmarks to guide the development of improved computational methods for calculating the energetics of elementary steps on late transition metal surfaces (i.e., reaction energies and activation barriers), such as density functional theory. The energy accuracy of such computational estimates is crucial for the future of catalysis research and catalyst discovery.

PV inertia and governor emulation requires reserving PV output and leads to solar energy waste. This paper exploits current grid resources and explores energy storage for primary frequency response under high PV penetration at the interconnection level. Based on the actual models of the U.S. Eastern Interconnection grid and the Texas grid, effects of multiple factors associated with primary frequency response, including the governor ratio, governor dead-band, droop rate, and fast load response, are assessed under high PV penetration scenarios. In addition, performance of batteries and supercapacitors using different control strategies is studied in the two interconnections. This paper quantifies the potential of various resources to improve interconnection-level primary frequency response under high PV penetration without curtailing solar output.

HESS relies on PV for charging and not the grid, and hence is immune to fluctuating electricity prices. The battery and SC are intended to supply predetermined constant power, but not to provide ancillary services for the grid operation. To develop a cost-effective energy storage system, a low pass filter (LPF) is used to allocate the power between a battery and a SC. The best cost of the energy storage is calculated based on the time constant of the LPF through extensive simulations. Several rule-based algorithms based on the battery state of charge (SOC) are developed to estimate the grid reference power for each one-hour dispatching period. An economic comparison of using different kinds of the algorithms for estimating the grid reference power are also presented in this study. The objective is to better understand the annual energy storage cost for hourly dispatching solar power. The actual solar data of four different days as a representative of each season recorded at Oak Ridge National Laboratory are used in the simulations. The relationship between the actual PV cell temperature and the ambient temperature in power output calculations are also considered and their effects on energy storage price calculations are presented in this paper.

The optimal sizing for all the components of the onsite generation system under the variations of the uncertain energy demand from manufacturing plant plays a critical role in achieving a cost-effective operational mode. In this paper, a Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming optimization model is proposed for sizing the capacity of onsite generation system with renewable sources and battery energy storage system for the manufacturers considering the energy loads from both manufacturing system and HVAC system in a typical manufacturing plant. An integrated simulation model is used to capture the variations of the plant-level electricity demand including both manufacturing and HVAC systems so that it can be used as the input to the proposed optimization model. Both linearization and meta-heuristic solution strategies are discussed and compared when solving the proposed optimization model considering both solution quality and computational time. A case study employing the relevant data of a real auto component manufacturing plant as well as the data of the renewable sources in the Chicago area is implemented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

Here, theoretical analysis and material design of metal-free carbon nanomaterials as efficient photo-/electrocatalysts to facilitate the critical chemical reactions in clean and sustainable energy technologies are reviewed. These reactions include the oxygen reduction reaction in fuel cells, the oxygen evolution reaction in metal-air batteries, the iodine reduction reaction in dye-sensitized solar cells, the hydrogen evolution reaction in water splitting, and the carbon dioxide reduction in artificial photosynthesis. Basic catalytic principles, computationally guided design approaches and intrinsic descriptors, catalytic material design strategies, and future directions are discussed for the rational design and synthesis of highly efficient carbon-based catalysts for clean energy technologies.

Mono-Elemental Properties of 2D Black Phosphorus Ensure Extended Charge Carrier Lifetimes under Oxidation: Time-Domain Ab Initio Analysis	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article							MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; PYXAID PROGRAM; QUANTUM DOTS; LAYER; SURFACE; SEMICONDUCTOR; RECOMBINATION; TRANSISTORS; EXFOLIATION; RELAXATION	An attractive two-dimensional semiconductor with tunable direct bandgap and high carrier mobility, black phosphorus (BP), is used in batteries, solar cells, photocatalysis, plasmonics, and optoelectronics. BP is sensitive to ambient conditions, with oxygen playing a critical role in structure degradation. Our simulations show that BP oxidation slows down charge recombination. This is unexpected, since typically charges are trapped and lost on defects. First, BP has no ionic character. It interacts with oxygen and water weakly, experiencing little perturbation to electronic structure. Second, phosphorus supports different oxidation states and binds extraneous atoms avoiding deep defect levels. Third, soft BP structure can accommodate foreign species without disrupting periodic geometry. Finally, BP phonon scattering on defects shortens quantum coherence and suppresses recombination. Thus, oxidation can be regarded as production of a self-protective layer that improves BP properties. These BP features should be common to other monoelemental 2D materials, stimulating energy and electronics applications.

To enable the synthesis of PEDOT, two different oxidants, antimony pentachloride (SbCl5) and vana-dium oxytrichloride (VOCl3), were utilized. The effect of deposition temperature on the polymer electroactivity and conductivity was evaluated by measuring the overpotential for the oxygen reduction reaction and film electrical conductivity, respectively. PEDOT films with conductivity values of similar to 2000 S/cm were deposited in a single step coating and doping process. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the residual metalloid within polymer films, in the case of SbCl5, is contributing to the hole conductivity. The electrocatalytic activity of deposited material in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was studied; the result indicate a direct relationship between the conductivity values and the electrocatalytic activities of the deposited films. The unique potential offered by oCVD to coat PEDOT conformally enabled us to apply a coat of electroactive polymers on complex structures of a gas diffusion layer fabric, carbon cloth. Using our approach, we imparted stable electrocatalytic activity to carbon cloth electrodes and fabricated all-organic electrodes for ORR.

However, the deployment of wireless charging lanes on highways and urban road networks can be costly and resource-intensive. A life cycle assessment (LCA) is conducted to compare the sustainability performance of DWPT applied in a network of highways and urban roads for charging electric passenger cars. The assessment compares DWPT to stationary wireless charging and to conventional plug-in charging using a case study of Washtenaw County in Michigan, USA over 20 years. The LCA is based on three key sustainability metrics: costs, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and energy burdens, encompassing not only the use phase burdens from electricity and fuel, but also the upfront deployment burdens of DWPT infrastructure. A genetic algorithm is applied to optimize the rollout of DWPT infrastructure both spatially and temporally in order to minimize life cycle costs, GHG, and energy burdens: (1) spatial optimization selects road segments to deploy DWPT considering traffic volume, speed, and pavement remaining service life (RSL); (2) temporal optimization determines in which year to deploy DWPT on a particular road segment considering EV market share growth as a function of DWPT coverage rate, future DWPT cost reduction, and charging efficiency improvement. Results indicate that optimal deployment of DWPT electrifying up to about 3% of total roadway lane-miles reduces life cycle GHG emissions and energy by up to 9.0% and 6.8%, respectively, and enables downsizing of the EV battery capacity by up to 48%, compared to the non-DWPT scenarios. Roadside solar panels and storage batteries are essential to significantly reduce life cycle energy and GHG burdens but bring additional costs. Breakeven analysis indicates a breakeven year for solar charging benefits to pay back the DWPT infrastructure burdens can be less than 20 years for GHG and energy burdens but longer than 20 years for costs. A monetization of carbon emissions of at least $250 per metric tonne of CO2 is required to shift the optimal "pro-cost" deployment to the optimal "pro-GHG" deployment. A roadway segment with volume greater than about 26,000 vehicle counts per day, speed slower than 55 miles per hour (1 mile = 1.609 km), and pavement RSL shorter than 3 years should be given a high priority for early-stage DWPT deployment.

J	Burugupally, SP; Weiss, L				Burugupally, Sindhu Preetham; Weiss, Leland			Design and performance of a miniature free piston expander	ENERGY			English	Article						Free piston; External combustion; Mathematical modeling; Open cycle; Phase change	ORGANIC RANKINE-CYCLE; WASTE HEAT-RECOVERY; LINEAR GENERATOR; SCROLL EXPANDER; BOILER	Heat engines are known for high power and energy densities compared to chemical batteries. The availability of free thermal energy solar and 'waste heat' from electronics provide an opportunity for power generation at miniature length scales (millimeter). Though free piston based expanders at macro length scales (centimeter and above) are found to be suitable for heat energy harvesting, their implementation at miniature scales are challenged by significant parasitic losses such as heat loss and pumping work, yielding low thermal efficiencies. In this manuscript, through physics-based models the behavior and performance of a miniature free piston expander that operates on an open cycle was investigated. Here, the design space of the free piston expander with an objective to achieve an efficiency of at least 15% was explored. Three observations are reported that contribute to higher efficiency operation: (1) a higher injection pressure; (2) an optimum nondimensionalized duration of injection time of 1.5; and (3) softer springs, lower loads, and heavier pistons. A sample calculation showed that a centimeter-sized expander can generate an output power of 2.24W at 18% efficiency. This study shows that both the performance parameters of the expander, namely efficiency and output power are sensitive to injection pressure of the working fluid compared to the time duration of the working fluid injection. The study reveals that the miniature free piston expander is promising for low temperature waste-heat harvesting. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The architecture uses the partial-power processing universal dc-dc optimizer to have flexible power control by regulating the T-node compensation current. The universal optimizer is configured with a dual active bridge dc-dc converter allowing bidirectional power flow and galvanic isolation. Three operation modes are proposed depending on the input sources connected. Based on the operation mode, the universal optimizer and a dc-ac inverter switch their control reference to deliver the maximum PV power and perform battery current control. The steady-state and transient operation of the closed-loop control scheme have been demonstrated through controller hardware-in-the-loop tests to verify feasibility and effectiveness of the PV-battery series inverter architecture.

First, the electric grid is integrating variable renewable generation, such as wind and solar. Second, demands are changing as heating systems are shifting from gas-based to high efficiency electric heat pumps. This paper provides a comparative analysis of future energy scenarios with distributed technology options including (1) wind and solar generation; (2) heat pumps for heating and cooling; and (3) battery and thermal storage in representative residential blocks in four cities, including New York City, New York; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Tallahassee, Florida; and Fort Collins, Colorado. These cities are located in three climate regions with different weather patterns which result in different demand profiles and different local renewable resources. Future energy demand scenarios with 100% penetration of air source or ground source heat pumps for heating and cooling are estimated for the four residential city blocks. Under a future scenario with all electric demand with air source heat pumps and high renewable energy penetration, this study finds that (1) the optimal wind and solar generation mix varies with location and amount of storage and (2) battery storage is more cost effective than thermal storage, ground source heat pumps, and overbuilt renewable generation.

Hydro power (including pumped-hydro), batteries, and fast responding thermal units are essential in providing system flexibility at elevated renewable penetration. How to quantify the merit of flexibility from these sources in accommodating variable renewables, and to evaluate the operational costs considering system flexibility constraints have been central challenges for future power system planning. This paper presents an improved linear formulation of the unit commitment model adopting unit grouping techniques to expedite evaluation of the curtailment of renewables and operational costs for large-scale power systems. All decision variables in this formulation are continuous, and all chronological constraints are formulated subsequently. Tested based on actual data from a regional power system in China, the computational speed of the model is more than 20,000 times faster than the rigorous unit commitment model, with less than 1% difference in results. Hourly simulation for an entire year takes less than 3 min. The results demonstrate strong potential to apply the proposed model to long term planning related issues, such as flexibility assessment, wind curtailment analysis, and operational cost evaluation, which could set a methodological foundation for evaluating the optimal combination of wind, solar and hydro investments.

Dynamic Optimization of High-Altitude Solar Aircraft Trajectories Under Station-Keeping Constraints	JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS			English	Article							POWERED AIRCRAFT	This paper demonstrates the use of nonlinear dynamic optimization to calculate energy-optimal trajectories for a high-altitude, solar-powered unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The objective is to maximize the total energy in the system while staying within a 3 km mission radius and meeting other system constraints. Solar energy capture is modeled using the vehicle orientation and solar position, and energy is stored both in batteries and in potential energy through elevation gain. Energy capture is maximized by optimally adjusting the angle of the aircraft surface relative to the sun. The UAV flight and energy system dynamics are optimized over a 24 h period at an 8 s time resolution using nonlinear model predictive control. Results of the simulated flights are presented for all four seasons, showing an 8.2% increase in end-of-day battery energy for the most limiting flight condition of the winter solstice.	[Martin, R.

Laboratory-based assessment of HVAC equipment for power grid frequency regulation: Methods, regulation performance, economics, indoor comfort and energy efficiency	ENERGY AND BUILDINGS			English	Article						Power grid ancillary service; Frequency regulation service; Variable-speed HVAC equipment; Economic analysis; Indoor comfort control	ANCILLARY SERVICE; DEMAND RESPONSE	Real-time power supply and demand balances are critical to ensure stable power frequency and quality power services. However, the growing integration of renewable energy increasingly challenges the power infrastructure because most of the renewable resources, e.g., solar and wind energy, are intermittent and difficult to predict. To meet stringent power frequency requirements, more fast reacting frequency regulation resources are being brought online among which grid-level batteries are the dominant ones. Buildings consume more than 73% of the electricity in the US, offering significant regulation reserve for the power grid. Variable-speed air-conditioning and heat pump systems are taking an increasing share of the market due to higher efficiency requirements imposed by federal agencies. In addition to efficiency benefits, variable-speed cooling/heating systems are also perfectly suited to provide frequency regulation service since these units can modulate their power continuously over a wide range. This paper presents a methodology and case study results for laboratory-based assessments of power frequency regulation service performance for variable-speed HVAC cooling equipment. The assessment methodology involves the use of both open- and closed-loop testing in psychrometric chambers. The open-loop testing quantifies the maximum possible performance of regulation services that is building independent, whereas the closed-loop testing provides representative performance for regulation services when the equipment must maintain comfort conditions for typical "virtual" buildings. Two air conditioning units, a variable-speed packaged rooftop unit (RTU) and a split heat pump with an after-market variable-speed retrofit, were utilized for regulation tests performed in psychrometric chambers. Both open-loop and closed-loop regulation control strategies were developed and tested for this equipment. Open-loop test results showed that variable-speed HVAC equipment can provide high quality regulation service with performance scores of up to 0.98. With PJM historical wholesale energy and regulation prices, the estimated regulation credit can offset up to 48% of the electricity price. The closed-loop regulation control was shown to have negligible impact on indoor comfort with temperature fluctuations smaller than 0.1 degrees C. Power regulation also did not cause any efficiency degradation for the closed-loop tests. In fact, for more humid climate conditions, the electrical input for cooling can even be reduced with regulation control due to reduced moisture removal. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, we propose a novel proton exchange membrane electrolyzer cell (PEMEC), consisting of non-conductive bipolar plates (BPs) and thin film liquid/gas diffusion layers (TF-LGDLs) to reduce the cost and improve the PEMEC performance. The 3D printed non-conductive BP is manufactured with low-cost polylactic acid (PLA) and is mainly functioned to distribute the water and gas products. A titanium thin film LGDL (TF-LGDL) with surroundings is developed for directly transporting electrons from the external power sources, which changes the electron transport path in the PEMECs. The PLA BP exhibits an extremely low cost (1/10 of that of the graphite BP), and the hydrogen production rate per unit BP cost in a PEMEC with PLA BP, is almost 6 times higher than a conventional one with graphite BPs. More importantly, the PEMECs with PLA BPs can achieve a good electrochemical performance of 2.21 V at 1 A/cm(2)under room temperature. A model is also developed to investigate the impact of the BP resistivity of on the cell performance, and a guideline for the selection guideline of conductivity of BPs material is provided. The easily accessible and low-cost PLA BPs coupled with the new electron-conducting path will drive the exploration of plastic materials for economic and efficient water splitting or other energy conversion devices, including fuel cells, batteries, and solar cells.

Currently, aluminum (Al) nanowires can be synthesized by thermally induced substitution of germanium (Ge) nanowires, chemical vapor deposition on other metal substrates, and template-assisted growth methods. However, there are still challenges in fabricating extremely high-purity nanowires, large-scale manufacturing, and simplifying the synthesis process and conditions. Here, we report for the first time that single-crystal Al nanowires can be one-step, in situ synthesized on a reduced graphene oxide (RGO) substrate on a large scale without using any catalysts. Through a simple high temperature treatment process, commercial micro-sized Al powders in RGO film were transformed into a single-crystal Al nanowire with an average length of 1.2 mu m and an average diameter of 18 nm. The possible formation mechanism of the single-crystal Al nanowires is proposed as follows: hot aluminum atoms eject from the pristine aluminum/alumina core/shell structure of Al powders when they build up enough energy from the thermal stress under high temperature and confined space conditions, which is supported by both experimental and computational results. The method introduced here can be extended to allow the synthesis of one-dimensional highly reactive materials, like alkali metal nanowires, in confined spaces.

J	Wu, F; Sioshansi, R				Wu, Fei; Sioshansi, Ramteen			A stochastic operational model for controlling electric vehicle charging to provide frequency regulation	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Electric vehicle; Vehicle charging; Charging control; Stochastic optimization; Frequency response	CONTROL ANCILLARY SERVICES; OPTIMIZATION MODEL; STATIONS; LOCATION; SIMULATION; AGGREGATOR; DEPLOYMENT; CAPACITY; IMPACTS; ENERGY	The charging of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) is a potential source of flexibility and ancillary services to power systems. This paper proposes a two-stage stochastic problem that can be used to optimize the charging of BEVs in a public charging station to provide frequency regulation and energy arbitrage. The model also co-optimizes the use of distributed energy resources, including battery energy storage and photovoltaic solar panels. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed model using a case study based on the Central-Ohio region. The case study shows that proper management of flexibility in BEV charging can provide high-quality frequency regulation services, which is also of significant financial value to the station operator. As such, the modeling methodology that we propose here can further accelerate the adoption of BEVs. This is because the value streams generated by the provision of frequency regulation can reduce the cost of BEV ownership and the net cost of owning and operating a public BEV-charging station.

Design and analysis of a standalone solar photovoltaic (PV) system with DC microgrid has been proposed to supply power for both DC and alternating current (AC) loads. The proposed system comprises of a solar PV system with boost DC/DC converter, Incremental conductance (IncCond) maximum power point tracking (MPPT), bi-directional DC/DC converter (BDC), DC-AC inverter and batteries. The proposed bi-directional DC/DC converter (BDC) lessens the component losses and upsurges the efficiency of the complete system after many trials for its components' selection. Additionally, the IncCond MPPT is replaced by Perturb & Observe (P&O) MPPT, and a particle swarm optimization (PSO) one. The three proposed techniques' comparison shows the ranking of the best choice in terms of the achieved maximum power and fastdynamic response. Furthermore, a stability analysis of the DC microgrid system is investigated with a boost converter and a bidirectional DC-DC converter with the Lyapunov function for the system has been proposed. The complete system is designed and executed in a MATLAB/SIMULINK environment and validated utilizing an OPAL real-time simulator.

However, collecting such measurements from every node in the network, although providing high accuracy and resolution of the phenomena of interest, may easily cause sensors' battery depletion. In this article, we show that measurement correlation can be successfully exploited to reduce the amount of data collected in the network without significantly sacrificing the monitoring accuracy. In particular, we propose an online adaptive measurement technique with which a subset of nodes are dynamically chosen as monitors while the measurements of the remaining nodes are estimated using the computed correlations. We propose an estimation framework based on jointly Gaussian distributed random variables, and we formulate an optimization problem to select the monitors under a total cost constraint. We show that the problem is NP-Hard and propose three efficient heuristics. We also develop statistical approaches that automatically switch between learning and estimation phases to take into account the variability occurring in real networks. Simulations carried out on real-world traces show that our approach outperforms previous solutions based on compressed sensing, and it can be successfully applied to the real application of solar irradiance prediction of photovoltaics systems.

Desalinating seawater generally produces brine as a by-product that cannot be purified economically with current technologies and which is instead released to the environment. In this Perspective, we discuss direct electrosynthesis of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) from sea-water desalination brine as an emerging alternative solution. In this direct electrosynthesis (DE) process, the water splitting reaction is used to produce H+ and OH-, which combine with the brine stream to produce NaOH and HCl. After introducing the scope of the process, we describe developments in earth-abundant catalysts for water splitting and the competing chlorine evolution reaction (CER), as well as challenges in inefficiency and productivity associated with these processes. Finally, we discuss the economic impact and feasibility of direct electrosynthesis.

Providing uninterrupted power the microgrid was composed of seven components - solar photovoltaics, wind-turbines, lead acid batteries, biodiesel generators, fuel cells, electrolyzers and H-2 tanks. Firstly, detailed mathematical models that predicted the hourly energy generation for each of the components were developed and validated. Secondly, based on an electricity dispatch strategy, configurations having lowest LCOE (Levelized Cost of Energy) were determined using an evolutionary optimization technique - Genetic Algorithm (GA). Results for a single home microgrid were verified using an exhaustive search technique that scanned the entire design space to find the lowest LCOE configuration. The microgrid size was subsequently increased to satisfy power requirements for 10 and 50 homes and new lowest LCOE configurations were determined using GA to examine the economies of scale effect on sustain ability. The LCOEs obtained were in the range of $0.32-0.42/kWh and were also compared with similar economic analyses available in the literature. The carbon footprint (LCA GHG emissions - CO2 eq.) was extremely low and was approximately 1/10th as that of an equivalent conventional electric grid.

Therefore, morphology or arrangement of these different materials can be critical in the performance of an energy conversion device. In this paper, we study a model problem motivated by a solar-driven thermochemical conversion device that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. We formulate the problem as a system of coupled multi-material reaction-diffusion equations where each species diffuses selectively through a given material and where the reaction occurs at multi-material interfaces. We introduce a phase-field formulation of the optimal design problem and numerically study selected examples.

With recent development of a battery as a viable energy storage device, the solar energy is transforming into amore reliable and steady source of power. Research and development of multiport converters is instrumental in enabling this transformation in an efficient manner. The high efficiency of conversion in comparatively smaller footprint makes a multiport converter very attractive in this application. Most of the recently reported multiport converter topologies are discussed here. A breakdown of isolated and nonisolated topologies is presented along with the comparison of converter architectures and features such as operating conditions, device count, efficiency, etc. Each group of multiport converters is subdivided into different smaller groups based on their architecture. Detailed specifications are presented for important topologies. Finally, a performance comparison is carried out featuring the advantages and disadvantages of the various topologies leading to suggestions for the direction of future research.

Herein, by employing first-principles calculations, we provide a facile surface chemistry method, i.e. functionalization, to acquire and reconfigure stable penta-silicene for use in flexible lithium-ion batteries. Our results of density functional theory calculations showed that the reconfigured penta-silicene nanosheets possess a broad range of properties, including semiconductors with an indirect bandgap, semiconductors with a direct bandgap, semimetals and metals. For fluorinated pentasilicene, a fluorine-concentration-induced transition from a semiconductor to a metal is found. For fully fluorinated penta-silicene, a mechanically induced transition from a semiconductor with an indirect bandgap to a semiconductor with a direct bandgap is obtained. Our calculation results showed the reconfigured penta-silicene is a high-performance anode for use in flexible lithium (Li)-ion batteries. A transition from a semiconductor to a metal with adsorption of Li atoms indicates a high electrical conductivity. It possesses low Li diffusion barriers (0.08-0.28 eV), demonstrating a high mobility of Li ions. The metallic feature and low Li diffusion barriers reveal that it has an ultrafast charge/discharge rate. This work suggests that surface chemistry reconfiguration provides new stable materials with excellent mechanical properties and tunable electronic properties for their promising applications in flexible metal-ion batteries and solar batteries as well as nanoelectronics devices.

Here, we report the synthesis and physicochemical properties of highly water-soluble (NH4)(3)[Fe(CN)(6)] and (NH4)(4)[Fe(CN)(6)] catholyte materials and their application in pH neutral AORFBs. A 1.5 M half-cell (NH4)(3)[Fe(CN)(6)]/(NH4)(4)[Fe(CN)(6)] redox flow battery confirmed the high capacity and stability of ammonium ferrocyanide catholyte at pH neutral conditions. Paired with 1,1'-bis(3-sulfonatopropyl)-4,4'-bipyridinium ((SPr)(2)V) anolyte, a 0.9 M symmetric (NH4)(4)[Fe(CN)(6)]/(SPr)(2)V AORFB free of supporting electrolytes exhibited excellent cycling performance including nearly 100% capacity retention in 1,000 cycles (1,100 testing hours), 62.6% energy efficiency at 40 mA/cm(2) operation current density, and a power density of 72.5 mW/cm(2), representing the most stable AORFB reported so far.

Uncertain nature of market price and power system parameters can be affected to economic performance of DERs and is caused deviation penalties during market settlements. This article introduces an optimal combined sharing strategy of fuel cell/wind turbine/battery storage unit and demand response as microgrid to improve all of them profit in market participation. In order to adjust of contracted power and reduce the imbalanced energy, the Adjusted Market (AM) is considered 3-7 h before the delivered time, which the offered power could be updated in this time. Uncertainty of markets and DERs generations is considered using an optimal stochastic optimization approach. The probabilistic scenarios are generated using forecast error database in daily, adjusted and imbalance market as production of DERs. Uncertain variables are predicted by a neuro-fuzzy model. Finally, to demonstrate of the proposed joint model strategy, a test system contain fuel cell/wind turbine/battery storage unit and demand response is considered and the results is calculated during one week, month, and year period in joint and separated conditions.

Cost and availability optimization of wind energy with distributed energy resources of a microgrid	WIND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Wind energy; microgrid; Operation and Maintenance cost; economic dispatch; optimization; availability		A microgrid, an emerging technology in the electric power systems, has various benefits due to the implementation of distributed energy sources along with the loads. A microgrid utilizing the wind energy, solar energy, combined heat and power, natural gas generator, diesel generator, and battery storage is considered in an islanded mode of operation. The economic dispatch optimization is implemented using a reduced gradient algorithm to optimize the Operation and Maintenance cost in the islanded mode of the microgrid. The cost of each energy source is evaluated for every hour of the day using MATLAB code. Then, the availability of each energy source in the microgrid is evaluated. The results obtained are validated by comparing the Operation and Maintenance cost and the availability of each energy source in the microgrid. The optimal solution is achieved by considering the change in wind forecast and battery energy storage profiles.

This makes the capacity configuration of the SWS system problematic when the capacity configuration method of traditional power generation is used. An optimal configuration method of the SWS system based on the hybrid genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization (GA-PSO) algorithm is proposed in this study to improve the stability and economy of the SWS system. The constituent elements of investment, maintenance cost and various reliability constraints of the SWS system were also discussed. The optimal configuration of the SWS system based on GA-PSO was explored to achieve the optimization objective, which was to minimize investment and maintenance costs of the SWS system while maintaining power supply reliability. The investment and maintenance costs of the SWS system under different configuration methods were calculated and analyzed on the bases of the monthly mean wind speed, solar radiation and load data of Xiaoertai Village in Zhangbei County of Hebei Province in the last 10 years. Results show that the optimal configuration method based on the GA-PSO algorithm could effectively improve the economy of the system and meet the requirements of system stability. The proposed method shows great potential for guiding the optimal configuration of the SWS system in remote areas.

OPTIMAL CONFIGURATION AND FIELD EXPERIMENTS FOR THE PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEM OF A SOLAR-POWERED HOSE-DRAWN TRAVELER	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE			English	Article						Driving power requirements; Field experiments; Hose-drawn traveler; Optimization model; Particle swarm optimization; Photovoltaic generation system	WATER PUMPING SYSTEMS; PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; IRRIGATION SYSTEM; OPTIMAL-DESIGN; ENERGY; PERFORMANCE; MODEL; FEASIBILITY; PSO	High energy consumption is one of the disadvantages of hose-drawn travelers due to the use of water turbines. This study proposes a photovoltaic-powered electric motor instead of a water turbine to achieve high transmission efficiency. A stand-alone photovoltaic generation system (PVGS) was designed for a hose-drawn traveler. To achieve cost savings, a sizing optimization model was built for the PVGS. In the optimization model, the minimum annual cost of the system, which includes the initial capital, replacement, installation, operation, and maintenance costs, is taken as the objective function. The constraints include the battery's state of charge (SOC) and the power supply reliability, which is composed of the load loss of power supply probability (LPSP) and the energy excess percentage (EXC). The total power produced by the PV panels and the total battery capacity are the decision variables. The optimization model of the PVGS is solved through a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm based on a penalty function. The model is then applied to calculate the optimal configuration of a JP75-300 hose-drawn traveler. Comparisons between the optimal configuration and other six configuration schemes were conducted to verify the optimal solution results. Furthermore, field experiments were performed to test the performance. Finally, the effects of meteorological conditions, driving velocity, and LPSP on the optimal configuration and the annual cost of the PVGS are discussed. The results show that the optimal configuration of this PVGS are 432 W total power from PV panels and 172 Ah total battery capacity, and the optimization model results are the optimal configuration based on comparisons. The optimal configuration met the power requirements of the hose-drawn traveler for four days of field experiments, indicating that the optimal configuration is feasible.

A specialized neural network algorithm has been employed to track the wind speed and solar irradiance all year round in two salient regions and the promising results have been analyzed for making the decision whether the data are reliable for forecasting or not. Four different types of models including PV-Grid, Wind-Grid, Wind-PV-Grid, and off-grid hybrid renewables are designed using the Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER Pro) software. By considering the key factors: net present cost, cost of energy, renewable fraction, local load demand, availability of renewable energy resources, system economics and greenhouse gas emissions, the optimal hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) configurations (Wind/PV/Grid/Battery) for the mentioned regions are determined. Various sensitivity and optimization variables, such as RE resources, local load demand, grid energy price, nominal discount rate, the life-time of wind turbine, the capacity of wind turbine, PV arrays, converter, and battery are used to make the decision. Detailed sensitivity analyses are performed to investigate how the optimal system configurations change with a tiny variation in input variables and results show output results are more sensitive on the variations in long-term average wind speed and solar irradiance, nominal discount rate, and the lifetime of wind turbines than the other inputs which is definitely a vital finding of this investigation. Finally, considering several decision making factors, a detailed feasibility chart is presented for two distinct nominal discount rates, i.e., 9 and 10, which depicts the economically viable renewable energy based plant size in the mentioned regions. Although the crux of this paper is based on providing low-cost electricity to people living in rural areas of Bangladesh, our propositions carry with them certain concomitant benefits, not least of which are environmental and social benefits.

The energy that EVs use is produced from renewable energy sources like solar power. However, under bad weather conditions, the power station will stop energy generation and will need to get power transported from other places. One solution is to set up some stations, which usually store excess energy. In special times, the energy stored by these stations can be used to supply electricity to all parts of the city. In this process, the position of the station that provides power should be considered carefully for the sake of reducing energy loss during transportation. The main idea of this paper focuses on how to choose positions for the stations. We put forward the concept of energy transport station (ETS) which can store and output energy, then we propose three algorithms, namely exhausted algorithm, greedy algorithm, and segmentation algorithm, to decide where to place ETSs so that the energy loss can be minimized. The algorithms will be simulated with data of bus route maps of Manhattan and the Pioneer Valley Transit Authority (PVTA), which will show the contrast of each algorithm and find their best application scenarios.

Base-load reactors can provide variable electricity to the grid by (1) sending some of their output (steam) to storage at times of low electricity prices and (2) using stored heat to produce added peak electricity at times of high electricity prices. Heat storage (steam accumulators, sensible heat, etc.) is less expensive than electricity storage (batteries, hydro pumped storage, etc.). The added cost of incrementally larger or standalone turbine generators for peak electricity production is small. However, energy storage systems (heat or electricity) can't provide assured capacity for extreme events, be it supply side (extended low-wind or low-solar conditions in systems with high wind or solar capacity) or demand side (long periods of cold or hot weather). With heat storage systems there is the option to provide peak electricity output when heat storage is depleted by heat addition with a water-tube boiler using natural gas, biofuels, or ultimately hydrogen. Fuel consumption for assured peaking capacity is small because most of the time the heat storage system meets peak electricity demands. The same systems enable reliable low-cost heat production for industry. Such systems enable an all nuclear or nuclear/hydro/ wind/solar/geothermal low-carbon electricity grid.

In order to improve the capacity factor, the PV system operates at its maximum power point during periods of lower irradiance, and the power output is limited to a rated value at high irradiance. The proposed configuration also incorporates a utility scale battery energy storage system (BESS) connected to the grid through an independent inverter and benefits of the experience gained with a 1-MW 2-MWh BESS large demonstrator. The BESS power smoothing and frequency regulation capabilities are illustrated though combined theoretical and experimental studies. The behavior of the grid connected PV and BESS combined system is studied using a modified IEEE 14 bus test system implemented in PSCAD/EMTDC. This paper also includes a sizing exercise for energy storage in order to provide dispatchable PV power.

The nanostructure was discovered after electrochemically etching doped nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) films. With high resolution SEM, we have repeatedly observed highly porous, fractal-like geometry with "shafts", "barbs" and "barbules" of the DNFs. A DNF has very high aspect ratio, with a height comparable to the thickness of the etched diamond film and a lateral size as small as several nanometers. This diamond nanostructure seems not to belong to either conventionally defined NCD or ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD). The Raman spectra tell that after the electrochemical etch, the DNFs have lower signals from the grain boundaries, compared with the Raman spectra before the etch, which suggests the pores of the DNFs was related with mass loss from the grain boundaries. Preliminary electrochemical characterization has observed more than 300 x capacitance increase after the DNFs are fabricated out of a NCD film. With the specific pore size and the ease of fabrication, the DNFs could be a great material choice for supercapacitors, batteries, sensors, and solar cells etc.	[Zeng, Hongjun; Moldovan, Nicolaie; Catausan, Grace] Adv Diamond Technol Inc, 48 E Belmont Dr, Romeoville, IL 60446 USA	Zeng, HJ (reprint author), Adv Diamond Technol Inc, 48 E Belmont Dr, Romeoville, IL 60446 USA.	zeng@thindiamond.com	Zeng, Hongjun/I-3497-2019	Zeng, Hongjun/0000-0002-4415-1367	DOE Small Business Innovative Research project [DE-SC0011265]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy SciencesUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC02-06CH11357]	The Work was supported by DOE Small Business Innovative Research project through award DE-SC0011265.

Here, we study local ion-transport dynamics in polymer films using time-resolved electrostatic force microscopy (trEFM). We establish a correspondence between local and macroscopic measurements using local trEFM and macroscopic electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). We use polymer films doped with lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) as a model system where the polymer backbone has oxanorbornenedicarboximide repeat units with an oligomeric ethylene oxide side chain of length n. Our results show that the local polymer response measured in the time domain with trEFM follows stretched-exponential relaxation kinetics, consistent with the Havriliak-Negami relaxation we measure in the frequency-domain EIS data for macroscopic samples of the same polymers. Furthermore, we show that the trEFM results capture the same trends as the EIS results-changes in ion dynamics with increasing temperature, increasing salt concentration, and increasing volume fraction of ethylene oxide side chains in the polymer matrix evolve with the same trends in both measurement techniques. We conclude from this correlation that trEFM data reflect, at the nanoscale, the same ionic processes probed in conventional EIS at the device level. Finally, as an example application for emerging materials syntheses, we use trEFM and infrared photoinduced force microscopy (PiFM) to image a diblock copolymer electrolyte for next-generation solid-state energy storage applications.

Materials and Designs for Power Supply Systems in Skin-Interfaced Electronics	ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH			English	Review							SOLAR-CELLS; ENERGY; BATTERY; SOFT	Recent advances in materials chemistry and composite materials design establish the foundations for classes of electronics with physical form factors that bridge the gap between soft biological organisms and rigid microsystems technologies. Skin-interfaced platforms of this type have broad utility in continuous clinical-grade monitoring, of physiological status, with the potential to significantly lower the cost and increase the, efficacy of modern health care. Development of materials and device designs for power supply systems in this context is critically important, and it represents a rapidly expanding focus of research in the chemical sciences. Reformulating conventional technologies into biocompatible platforms and co-integrating them into skin-interfaced systems demand innovative approaches in materials chemistry and engineering. In terms of physical properties, the resulting devices must offer levels of flexibility, stretchability, thickness, and mass density that approach those of the epidermis itself, while maintaining operational characteristics and mechanical durability for practical use outside of a laboratory or hospital. While nearly all commercially available components for energy storage and harvesting are rigid and planar, recent research provides options in devices that are biocompatible not only at the level of the constituent materials but also in terms of the mechanics and geometrical forms, with resulting capabilities for establishing stable, nonirritating, intimate interfaces to the skin for extended periods of time. This Account highlights the range of materials choices and associated device architectures for skin-interfaced power supply systems. The Account begins with an overview of the main design strategies, ranging from one-, two-, and three-dimensional engineered composite structures to active materials that are intrinsically stretchable. The following sections describe a broad collection of devices based on these concepts, starting with batteries and supercapacitors for storage and then photovoltaic, piezoelectric, triboelectric, and thermoelectric devices for harvesting. Representative examples highlight recent advances, with a focus on the relationship between the materials and the performance during deformation. A final section discusses the challenges and opportunities in this area. Continued efforts in fundamental chemical research will be critically important to progress in this emerging field of technology. For example, understanding the mechanisms by which physical deformations affect the intrinsic materials properties and the system-level performance requires further study. The development of stretchable and biocompatible solid electrolytes with high ionic conductivity is an example of a specific area of interest for energy storage devices. Here and in other storage and harvesting systems advanced materials are needed to provide robust barriers to environmental factors. Work to address these and other interesting challenges will demand multidisciplinary collaborations between chemists, materials scientists, bioengineers, and clinicians, all oriented toward establishing the foundations for technologies that could help to address global grand challenges in human health care.

Distributed energy storage is a potential solution for buffering the intermittent supply of energy from such stochastic resources and increasing reliability. This paper quantifies the benefit of investing in battery energy storage systems (BESS) along with relatively high solar photovoltaic (PV) penetrations to defer capital-intensive investments in distribution system assets. Uncertainties in the load growth and the solar PV generation are considered in the assessment of risk by using modified risk-adjusted cost ratios. Furthermore, the size and allocation of BESS in the network system are optimized by applying a heuristic algorithm. The results are demonstrated via simulations on a typical Latin American distribution network. Simulation results indicate that the flexibility of BESS for distribution planning lies in closely accommodating the growth demand and distributed PV integration.

In this paper, realistic forecast errors are prescribed, and a corrective approach is proposed to mitigate the negative effects of day-ahead persistence forecast error by short-term forecasts from a state-of-the-art sky imager system. These forecasts preserve the spatiotemporal dependence structure of forecast errors avoiding statistical approximations. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on a receding horizon quadratic program developed for valley filling the midday net load depression through electric vehicle charging. Throughout one month of simulations the ability to flatten net load is assessed under practical forecast accuracy levels achievable from persistence, sky imager and perfect forecasts. Compared to using day-ahead persistence solar forecasts, the proposed corrective approach using sky imager forecasts delivers a 25% reduction in the standard deviation of the daily net load. It is demonstrated that correcting day-ahead forecasts in real time with more accurate short-term forecasts benefits the valley filling solution. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Unfortunately, no research efforts as of now have been directed specifically toward understanding the fundamental relationship between the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and water demand. This research aims to fill this knowledge gap by analyzing the water consumption and withdrawal impacts resulting from the increased usage of alternative vehicle technologies in the United States. 5 vehicle types - Internal Combustion Vehicles (ICVs), Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs), Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV20, PHEV40) and Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) - are analyzed across 50 U.S. states with 3 different electricity generation mix profiles: the state-based average electricity generation mix, the state-based marginal electricity generation mix, and a hypothetical electricity generation mix consisting entirely of solar-powered charging stations. The well-to-wheel (WTW) life cycle analysis is used for the water footprint calculations. In worst case, BEVs may consume up to 70 times more water than ICVs. BEVs with solar charging have the lowest levels of water consumption and withdrawal and can reduce transportation water footprint by up to 97%. In most of the states, the marginal electricity generation mix has higher water consumption and withdrawal values than those of the average electricity generation mix. In particular, the authors suggest the use of BEVs with solar charging for states with the highest water stressed areas (California (CA), Arizona (AZ), Nevada (NV), Florida (FL), etc.), and recommend the inclusion of incentives by federal and state governments for these states.

Wireless, battery-free, flexible, miniaturized dosimeters monitor exposure to solar radiation and to light for phototherapy	SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE			English	Article							SKIN-CANCER; NEWBORN-INFANT; THERAPY; UVA; SENSITIVITY; END	Exposure to electromagnetic radiation can have a profound impact on human health. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun causes skin cancer. Blue light affects the body's circadian melatonin rhythm. At the same time, electromagnetic radiation in controlled quantities has beneficial use. UV light treats various inflammatory skin conditions, and blue light phototherapy is the standard of care for neonatal jaundice. Although quantitative measurements of exposure in these contexts are important, current systems have limited applicability outside of laboratories because of an unfavorable set of factors in bulk, weight, cost, and accuracy. We present optical metrology approaches, optoelectronic designs, and wireless modes of operation that serve as the basis for miniature, low-cost, and battery-free devices for precise dosimetry at multiple wavelengths. These platforms use a system on a chip with near-field communication functionality, a radio frequency antenna, photodiodes, supercapacitors, and a transistor to exploit a continuous accumulation mechanism for measurement. Experimental and computational studies of the individual components, the collective systems, and the performance parameters highlight the operating principles and design considerations. Evaluations on human participants monitored solar UV exposure during outdoor activities, captured instantaneous and cumulative exposure during blue light phototherapy in neonatal intensive care units, and tracked light illumination for seasonal affective disorder phototherapy. Versatile applications of this dosimetry platform provide means for consumers and medical providers to modulate light exposure across the electromagnetic spectrum in a way that can both reduce risks in the context of excessive exposure and optimize benefits in the context of phototherapy.

J	Gummeson, J				Gummeson, Jeremy			ENERGY HARVESTING IS CHARGING UP	MOBILE COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS REVIEW			English	Article								There have been a number of energy harvesting systems proposed over the years and they have seen varying degrees of adoption. The motivation for energy harvesting varies according to the class of application: 1) In green energy applications, solar harvesting has seen widespread adoption to offset rising energy costs and to reduce CO2 emissions, 2) In infrastructure monitoring applications, low power sensors have made use of solar and thermal harvesting to avoid restrictive battery maintenance when deploying sensors at scale, and 3) in mobile applications, harvesting has been used to extend device battery lifetime and the charging burden imposed on the end user. In short, mobile computing systems focus on energy harvesting as a technique to relax or eliminate dependencies on batteries.

Investigation of the Power Generated by a Disk Buoy-WEC Design	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OFFSHORE AND POLAR ENGINEERING			English	Article						Disk buoy; SEAREV; WEC; pendulum device; COUPLE software	UNIDIRECTIONAL IRREGULAR WAVES; ENERGY CONVERTERS; TAKE-OFF; MODEL	Disk-shaped oceanographic buoys are commonly deployed with instrumentation to monitor and store localized environmental conditions for later transmission to passing oceanographic vessels or orbiting satellites for analysis and interpretation. The instrumentation and beacons are powered by battery packs and may utilize solar panels for recharging. Unfortunately, both the solar panels and instrumentation are too often vandalized. This research study investigates a SEAREV buoy design concept that features a pendulum wave energy conversion system inside an enclosure beneath the standard buoy hull. In this research study, a Lagrange formulation is used to develop equations of motion that are coupled with a hydraulic power take-off system. An in-house simulation model was selected to predict the buoy surge and pitch motions needed to estimate the electrical energy generated from a design seas. An iterative computational scheme was developed that utilizes an equivalent damping model of the power take-off system. The illustrative examples consider two four-meter disk buoys modified with a SEAREV wave energy conversion device, and they are subjected to relatively benign sea conditions using field measurements obtained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the Gulf of Mexico. A scatter diagram of the data was developed and used as the basis to estimate the buoy surge and pitch response and the resulting power generated. Bounded power estimates are presented and based on a limited survey of disk buoy power requirements; the predicted results for the system without optimization can provide four to five watts of power, and the findings are quite promising.

Unlike photovoltaic (PV) technology, thermal storage is used in lieu of batteries for electricity generation. However, the cost of current collection optics in a CSP plant hampers commercial competitiveness with PVs and natural gas. The use of a planar focusing collector (PFC) could help reduce cost of materials, installation, and maintenance. We present two candidate PFC designs, one based on metasurfaces and the other a Fresnel-like model. We feed each design through the entire system process (design, fabrication, scalability, and techno-economic feasibility) and discuss the challenges met at each stage. Two-photon and nanoimprint lithography are used to make PFC molds and replicas, respectively. We find that the annual optical efficiency for the Fresnel-based PFC is similar to 40%, higher than the current 30% target for natural gas, thereby suggesting potential economic advantages in the market of industrial process heat.

J	Bashir, N; Irwin, D; Shenoy, P; Taneja, J				Bashir, Noman; Irwin, David; Shenoy, Prashant; Taneja, Jay			Mechanisms and Policies for Controlling Distributed Solar Capacity	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article						Solar; fairness; net meter		The rapid expansion of intermittent grid-tied solar capacity is making the job of balancing electricity's real-time supply and demand increasingly challenging. Recent work proposes mechanisms for actively controlling solar power in the grid at individual sites by enabling software to cap it as a fraction of its time-varying maximum output. However, while enforcing an equal fraction of each solar site's time-varying maximum output results in "fair" short-term contributions of solar power across all sites, it does not result in "fair" long-term contributions of solar energy. Enforcing fair long-term energy access is important when controlling distributed solar capacity, since limits on solar output impact the compensation users receive for net metering and the battery capacity required to store excess solar energy. This discrepancy arises from fundamental differences in enforcing "fair" access to the grid to contribute solar energy, compared to analogous fair sharing in networks and processors. To address the problem, we first present both a centralized and distributed algorithm to enable control of distributed solar capacity that enforces fair grid energy access. We then present multiple policies that show how utilities can leverage this new distributed rate-limiting mechanism to reduce variations in grid demand from intermittent solar generation.

Open-Source Wireless Cloud-Connected Agricultural Sensor Network	JOURNAL OF SENSOR AND ACTUATOR NETWORKS			English	Article						Arduino; microcontroller; cellular; internet; soil moisture; agriculture		Agricultural research involves study of the complex soil-plant-atmosphere-water system, and data relating to this system must be collected under often-harsh outdoor conditions in agricultural environments. Rapid advancements in electronic technologies in the last few decades, as well as more recent widespread proliferation and adoption of electronic sensing and communications, have created many options to address the needs of professional, as well as amateur, researchers. In this study, an agricultural research project was undertaken to collect data and examine the effects of different agronomic practices on yield, with the objectives being to develop a monitoring system to measure soil moisture and temperature conditions in field plots and to upload the data to an internet website. The developed system included sensor nodes consisting of sensors and electronic circuitry to read and transmit sensor data via radio and a cellular gateway to receive node data and forward the data to an internet website via cellular infrastructure. Microcontroller programs were written to control the nodes and gateway, and an internet website was configured to receive and display sensor data. The battery-powered sensor nodes cost $170 each, including electronic circuitry and sensors, and they were operated throughout the cropping season with little maintenance on a single set of batteries. The solar-powered gateway cost $163 to fabricate, plus an additional cost of $2 per month for cellular network access. Wireless and cellular data transmissions were reliable, successfully transferring 95% of sensor data to the internet website. Application of open-source hardware, wireless data transfer, and internet-based data access therefore offers many options and advantages for agricultural sensing and monitoring efforts.

J	Miller, I; Gencer, E; O'Sullivan, FM				Miller, Ian; Gencer, Emre; O'Sullivan, Francis M.			A General Model for Estimating Emissions from Integrated Power Generation and Energy Storage. Case Study: Integration of Solar Photovoltaic Power and Wind Power with Batteries	PROCESSES			English	Article						solar PV; wind power; life cycle analysis; energy storage	GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT	The penetration of renewable power generation is increasing at an unprecedented pace. While the operating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of photovoltaic (PV) and wind power are negligible, their upstream emissions are not. The great challenge with the deployment of renewable power generators is their intermittent and variable nature. Current electric power systems balance these fluctuations primarily using natural gas fired power plants. Alternatively, these dynamics could be handled by the integration of energy storage technologies to store energy during renewable energy availability and discharge when needed. In this paper, we present a model for estimating emissions from integrated power generation and energy storage. The model applies to emissions of all pollutants, including greenhouse gases (GHGs), and to all storage technologies, including pumped hydroelectric and electrochemical storage. As a case study, the model is used to estimate the GHG emissions of electricity from systems that couple photovoltaic and wind generation with lithium-ion batteries (LBs) and vanadium redox flow batteries (VFBs). To facilitate the case study, we conducted a life cycle assessment (LCA) of photovoltaic (PV) power, as well as a synthesis of existing wind power LCAs. The PV LCA is also used to estimate the emissions impact of a common PV practice that has not been comprehensively analyzed by LCA-solar tracking. The case study of renewables and battery storage indicates that PV and wind power remain much less carbon intensive than fossil-based generation, even when coupled with large amounts of LBs or VFBs. Even the most carbon intensive renewable power analyzed still emits only similar to 25% of the GHGs of the least carbon intensive mainstream fossil power. Lastly, we find that the pathway to minimize the GHG emissions of power from a coupled system depends upon the generator. Given low-emission generation (<50 gCO(2)e/kWh), the minimizing pathway is the storage technology with lowest production emissions (VFBs over LBs for our case study). Given high-emission generation (>200 gCO(2)e/kWh), the minimizing pathway is the storage technology with highest round-trip efficiency (LBs over VFBs).

Rutile Alloys in the Mn-Sb-O System Stabilize Mn3+ To Enable Oxygen Evolution in Strong Acid	ACS CATALYSIS			English	Article						oxygen evolution reaction; catalysis; electrochemical stability; metal oxide alloys; combinatorial materials science	EFFICIENT WATER OXIDATION; TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; HIGH-SURFACE-AREA; MANGANESE OXIDE; HIGHLY EFFICIENT; ELECTROCATALYSTS; PERFORMANCE; REQUIREMENTS; CATALYSTS; ROBUST	Electrocatalysis of the oxygen evolution reaction is central to several energy technologies including electrolyzers, solar fuel generators, and air breathing batteries. Strong acid electrolytes are desirable for many implementations of these technologies, although the deployment of such device designs is often hampered by the lack of non-precious-metal oxygen evolution electrocatalysts, with Ir-based oxides comprising the only known catalysts that exhibit stable activity at low overpotential. During our exploration of the Mn-Sb-O system for precious-metal-free electrocatalysts, we discovered that Mn can be incorporated into the rutile oxide structure at much higher concentrations than previously known, and that these Mn-rich rutile alloys exhibit great catalytic activity with current densities exceeding 50 mA cm(-2) at 0.58 V overpotential and catalysis onset at 0.3 V overpotential. While this activity does not surpass that of IrO2, Pourbaix analysis reveals that the Mn-Sb rutile oxide alloys have the same or better thermodynamic stability under operational conditions. By combining combinatorial composition, structure, and activity mapping with synchrotron X-ray absorption measurements and first principles materials chemistry calculations, we provide a comprehensive understanding of these oxide alloys and identify the critical role of Sb in stabilizing the trivalent Mn octahedra that have been shown to be effective oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts.

Solar and wind power conversion technologies have become cost effective recently, but challenges remain to manage electrical grid dynamics and to meet end-use requirements for energy dense fuels and chemicals. Renewable hydrogen provides the best opportunity for a zero emissions fuel and is the best feedstock for production of zero emission liquid fuels and some chemical and heat end-uses. Renewable hydrogen can be made at very high efficiency using electrolysis systems that are dynamically operated to complement renewable wind and solar power dynamics. Hydrogen can be stored within the existing natural gas system to provide low cost massive storage capacity that (1) could be sufficient to enable a 100% zero emissions grid; (2) has sufficient energy density for end-uses including heavy duty transport; (3) is a building block for zero emissions fertilizer and chemicals; and (4) enables sustainable primary energy in all sectors of the economy.

MISIMO: A Multi-Input Single-Inductor Multi-Output Energy Harvesting Platform in 28-nm FDSOI for Powering Net-Zero-Energy Systems	IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS			English	Article						Buck-boost; dc-dc converter; energy harvester; hysteresis; Internet of Things (IoT); multiple inputs; multiple outputs; net-zero energy systems; pulse-frequency modulation (PFM); wearables	BIOFUEL CELLS; CONVERTERS; VIBRATION; SOLAR	This paper presents a power management unit that meets the need of small-form-factor net-zero energy systems by aggregating the maximum available power from three different energy sources while simultaneously regulating three output power rails over a wide dynamic load range, while also managing the charging and discharging of a battery, all in a single-stage single-inductor converter. The proposed architecture uses hysteresis control to regulate the voltage of each harvester at their respective maximum power points (MPPs) using pulse-frequency modulation (PFM) and adaptive inductor ON-time, all via a low-power event-driven controller. The converter, fabricated in 28-nm fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI), achieves a peak efficiency of 89% and supports an output power range from 1 mu W to 60 mW with efficiency > 75% at V-out = 1 V and >69% at V-out = 0.6 - 0.9 V, all with a quiescent power of only 262 nW.

This paper reviews the development of structural capacitors and enunciates their design and applications. A structural capacitor is commonly a polymer-matrix structural composite with a dielectric film between the electrodes, which are an electronic conductor, commonly the continuous carbon fiber laminae that serve to reinforce the composite. The dielectric film is preferably small in thickness and serves to avoid short circuiting of the two electrodes. In order to maximize the capacitance by having the structural capacitor constitute capacitors in parallel, the dielectric film is preferably positioned at every interlaminar interface of the composite, such that alternating electrodes in the stack are connected to opposite polarities of the AC electric field source. A structural supercapacitor requires the matrix to be a solid electrolyte. From the viewpoints of structural performance, safety, service life and high frequency capability, structural dielectric capacitors are closer to commercialization readiness than structural supercapacitors. Structural capacitors have not yet been commercialized, but they are expected to provide an untapped, extensive, save and distributed means of energy storage, and allow aircraft, satellites, automobile, ships, wind turbines, buildings, solar panels, display panels, outdoor lighting, computers, cell phones, etc., to store energy in their structures.

Many leading-edge studies have started to explore server clusters running on multiple power sources. Existing approaches do not sufficiently consider the fine-grained power delivery to satisfy diverse requirements in datacenter, especially in the multi-tenant/colocation datacenter, which may yield low energy utilization. To address the emerging trend and new requirements, this article proposes a novel Datacenter inner Power Switch Network (DiPSN) to improve datacenter power efficiency and user satisfaction. DiPSN is a reconfigurable and easy-to-scale-out power architecture, which enables datacenter to distribute various power sources in a fine-grained manner. Moreover, a tailored machine learning based power source management framework is proposed for DiPSN to dynamically optimize user customized performance metrics and maximize datacenter revenue. Compared with conventional single-switch power distribution system, our DiPSN can be configured to improve solar energy utilization by 39.6 percent, reduce utility power cost by 11.1 percent and improve workload performance by 33.8 percent. Meanwhile, our design can extend battery lifetime by 9.3 percent. This work could provide valuable guidelines for designing heterogeneous power distribution architecture and management methodology in datacenters for improving user-customizable efficiency, sustainability and economy.

Moreover, by using the batteries of plug-in electrical vehicles (PEVs), the active and reactive power support functions can be provided at certain buses in a power system. Hence, parking lots with a large number of PEVs, referred to as SmartParks, can provide these functions at bulk level. Thus, by appropriate control of SmartParks, the active and reactive power flows in a power system can be regulated to achieve the funetionalities of oscillation damping control, transmission line power flow regulation and bus voltage control. In this paper, in order to realize these three funetionalities concurrently by using SmartParks, fuzzy-logic based controllers are proposed. Wide area measurements from a power system can be used to generate the active and reactive power output dispatch command signals for SmartParks. The parameters of the fuzzy logic controllers are heuristically determined to provide optimal system-wide performances for oscillation damping, transmission line power flow regulation and bus voltage control. Typical results are provided on a 12-bus power system with 400 MW wind farm implemented on a real-time simulation platform.

The Role of Firm Low-Carbon Electricity Resources in Deep Decarbonization of Power Generation	JOULE			English	Article							SOLAR POWER; ENERGY-STORAGE; SYSTEM; FLEXIBILITY; WIND; FUTURE; TRANSFORMATION; RELIABILITY; CHALLENGES; OPERATIONS	We investigate the role of firm low-carbon resources in decarbonizing power generation in combination with variable renewable resources, battery energy storage, demand flexibility, and long-distance transmission. We evaluate nearly 1,000 cases covering varying CO2 limits, technological uncertainties, and geographic differences in demand and renewable resource potential. Availability of firm low-carbon technologies, including nuclear, natural gas with carbon capture and sequestration, and bioenergy, reduces electricity costs by 10%-62% across fully decarbonized cases. Below 50 gCO(2)/kWh, these resources lower costs in the vast majority of cases. Additionally, as emissions limits decrease, installed capacity of several resources changes non-monotonically. This underscores the need to evaluate near-term policy and investment decisions based on contributions to long-term decarbonization rather than interim goals. Installed capacity for all resources is also strongly affected by uncertain technology parameters. This emphasizes the importance of a broad research portfolio and flexible policy support that expands rather than constrains future options.

In this work, NiFe-based selenide (Ni-Fe-Se) is synthesized by hydrothermal treatment of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and Se powder. The effects of hydrothermal temperature and mass ratio of precursors on the decomposition and selenization of MOFs were investigated. Compared with NiFe based oxide, Ni-Fe-Se is favorable for improving the electronic conductivity and reduce the charge transfer resistance, promoting the formation of the higher oxidative valence of Ni species during OER process. Benefiting from the desirable advantages with unique composition, the Ni-Fe-Se material prepared under optimal conditions shows excellent electrocatalytic activities toward OER with the lower overpotential of 216 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Besides, the resulting Ni-Fe-Se catalyst exhibits excellent durability when used as air cathode in Zn-air battery. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Due to volatilities in electricity market, the overall price of energy provision for industrial consumers cannot be determined. In this work, a new optimization approach is developed for modeling the uncertainty of pool yield rate. Also, a new operation method of risk-averse proposed and contrasted with risk-neutral method is suggested. In this process, DeRP is utilized in order to decrease the overall price of electric energy for industrial customers. To show the efficiency of proposed method, fare comparison is presented between the deterministic approach and proposed optimization model with and without considering the DeRP. Obtained results show that, implementing the DeRP, the energy provision costs are reduced using risk-neutral and risk averse approaches, respectively. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A largely untapped efficiency strategy is to improve the efficiency of power distribution within buildings. Direct current (DC) distribution with modern power electronics has the potential to eliminate much of the power conversion loss in alternating current (AC) building distribution networks that include photovoltaics and DC end uses. Previous literature suggests up to 15% energy savings from DC power distribution in very energy efficient buildings with onsite generation and battery storage. This paper extends prior energy modeling of DC versus AC distribution in buildings, to consider the cost of implementing DC systems on a life-cycle basis. A techno-economic analysis framework based on commercially available products that evaluates the cost-effectiveness of DC systems is presented. The analysis is conducted for three commercial building types in two California climate zones and for various PV and battery storage capacities. Monte Carlo simulation is used to compute the payback period and lifecycle cost savings of DC versus AC distribution systems. A future-market scenario is also examined, which evaluates how future efficiency improvements in power converters and changes in electricity tariffs may affect cost savings. This analysis shows that DC systems can be cost-effective in all scenarios that include large capacities of battery storage and onsite solar, whereas for systems without storage, DC distribution is generally not cost-effective.

This paper presents a methodology for optimal least cost sizing of generation assets while meeting explicit reliability constraints in micro-grids that are capable of active demand management. The battery management model considers kinetic constraints on battery operation and represents dispatch in the field to regulate the depth of discharge. The model allows consideration of the trade-off between depth of discharge, cycle life, and calendar lifetime in lead acid batteries. Separate reliability targets for disaggregated, residential load profiles at hourly timesteps are considered to evaluate the performance and cost reduction potential of demand-side management capabilities-with economic results and sensitivity analyses around key input assumptions subsequently presented.

The History of Palladium-Catalyzed Cross-Couplings Should Inspire the Future of Catalyst-Transfer Polymerization	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Review							TRANSFER CONDENSATION POLYMERIZATION; CHAIN-GROWTH POLYMERIZATION; AB-TYPE MONOMERS; CONJUGATED MICROPOROUS POLYMERS; POWER CONVERSION EFFICIENCY; HETEROJUNCTION SOLAR-CELLS; DONOR-ACCEPTOR POLYMERS; FIELD-EFFECT MOBILITY; SUZUKI-MIYAURA; TRANSFER POLYCONDENSATION	Conjugated polymers are the workhorse materials in organic electronics, a field that is rapidly growing to encompass energy storage devices such as supercapacitors and batteries. The highest-performing materials today have incredibly diverse structures and are accessed via step-growth polymerizations. This method results in limited control over the polymer's molecular weight, sequence, and dispersity, all of which can significantly impact device performance. The discovery of catalyst-transfer polymerization (CTP) in 2004 was predicted to change this landscape. Instead, nearly 14 years later, the CTP scope remains mostly limited to polymerizing small, electron-rich monomers. There is a pronounced gap between the rich array of structures utilized in organic electronics and what can be polymerized in a living, chain-growth fashion via CTP. Here, we suggest that palladium precatalysts could bridge this gap based on their huge versatility in the small molecule cross-coupling literature. We highlight specific ancillary ligands from the small-molecule literature that we anticipate are candidates for enabling diverse conjugated polymer syntheses based on nearly a decade of research into the CTP mechanism. In addition, we describe several recent promising examples of CTP mediated by Pd precatalysts that serve as inspiration for the future. We present this Perspective as a call-to-action to advance organic electronics with CTP.

Wearable transparent thermal sensors and heaters based on metal-plated fibers and nanowires	NANOSCALE			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; TEMPERATURE-SENSOR; ELECTRODES; FILM; PHOTODETECTORS; NANOPARTICLES; DEVICES; LAYER	Electrospun metal-plated nanofibers and supersonically sprayed nanowires were used to fabricate hybrid films exhibiting a superior low sheet resistance of 0.18 Omega sq(-1), a transparency of 91.1%, and a figure-of-merit of 2.315 Omega(-1). The films are suitable to serve as thermal sensors and heaters. Such hybrid transparent conducting films are highly flexible and thus wearable. They can be used as body-temperature monitors and heaters. The employed hybrid approach improved the sheet resistance diminishing it to a minimum, while maintaining transparency. In addition, the low sheet resistance of the films facilitates their powering with a low-voltage battery and thus, portability. The thermal sensing and heating capabilities were demonstrated for such films with various sheet resistances and degrees of transparency. The temperature sensing was achieved by the resistance change of the film; the resistance value was converted back to temperature. The sensing performance increased with the improvement in the sheet resistance. The temperature coefficient of resistivity was TCR = 0.0783 K-1. The uniform distribution of the metal-plated nanofibers and nanowires resulted in a uniform Joule heating contributing to an efficient convection heat transfer from the heaters to the surrounding, demonstrated by an improved convective heat transfer coefficient.

Myths and reality of HPbI3 in halide perovskite solar cells	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							ORGANIC-INORGANIC PEROVSKITES; HYBRID PEROVSKITES; PHASE-TRANSITION; THIN-FILMS; EFFICIENT; STABILITY; PRECURSOR; TIN; FORMAMIDINIUM; ALPHA-CSPBI3	All-inorganic perovskites have a special place in halide perovskite family because of their potential for better stability. However, the representative cesium lead iodide (CsPbI3) is metastable and spontaneously converts to the non-perovskite structure at room temperature. Here, we demonstrate that what appears to be all-inorganic CsPbI3 stabilized in its perovskite form using the purported intermediate known as hydrogen lead iodide (HPbI3) is, in fact, the hybrid perovskite cesium dimethylammonium lead iodide (Cs(1-x)DMA(x)PbI(3), x = 0.2 to 0.5). Thus, many of the reported all-inorganic perovskites are actually still hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites, as strongly evidenced by a wide battery of experimental techniques presented here. Solar cells based on the representative composition Cs(0.7)DMA(0.3)PbI(3) can achieve an average power conversion efficiency of 9.27 +/- 1.28% (max 12.62%). These results provide an alternative angle to look at previous results pertaining all-inorganic CsPbI3 while the DMA cation is now revealed as an alternative A site cation.

However, large volume expansion, poor intrinsic conductivity, and sluggish reaction kinetics have greatly hindered its practical application. The controlled creation of oxygen vacancy (OV) defects allows the intrinsic properties of SnO2 to be effectively modulated, but related work concerning SIBs is still lacking. In this Minireview, the mechanism of failure of SnO2 electrodes is discussed and an overview of recent progress in the general synthesis of OV-containing SnO2 materials and the feasible detection of OVs in SnO2 is presented. The use of OV-containing SnO2-based anode materials in SIBs is also reviewed. Finally, challenges and future opportunities to engineer OVs for semiconductor oxides are examined.

The monolithic integration of photoelectrochemical solar energy conversion and electrochemical energy storage offers an efficient and compact approach toward practical solar energy utilization. Here, we present the design principles for and the demonstration of a highly efficient integrated solar flow battery (SFB) device with a record solar-to-output electricity efficiency of 14.1%. Such SFB devices can be configured to perform all the requisite functions from solar energy harvest to electricity redelivery without external bias. Capitalizing on high-efficiency and high-photovoltage tandem III-V photoelectrodes that are properly matched with high-cell-voltage redox flow batteries and carefully designed flow field architecture, we reveal the general design principles for efficient SFBs.

Solar-powered radio tags reveal patterns of post-fledging site visitation in adult and juvenile Tree Swallows Tachycineta bicolor	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NATAL DISPERSAL; MIGRATION; MOVEMENTS; SURVIVAL; PASSERINES; OCCUPANCY; MIGRANTS; BEHAVIOR; RADAR; SEX	The availability of small, lightweight tracking devices enhances our ability to study birds during mobile phases of their lives. Tree Swallows Tachycineta bicolor, a model species of wild songbird, are well-studied during their breeding season; but our understanding of their biology at other times of the year, when they are not tied to the fixed location of a nest, is more limited. We developed a lightweight radio tag with no battery (solar nanotag) to study the movements of small animals, and we deployed it to explore the behavior of Tree Swallows after the end of their summer breeding season. We tagged 32 breeding adult swallows and 36 juveniles and monitored their presence and absence at the breeding site during the post-fledging period. Although our observations are based on very small sample sizes, the tags revealed previously unknown patterns in Tree Swallow behavior during the post-breeding season. Some Tree Swallow fledglings continued to visit the site repeatedly in the months following the nesting season, with the latest detection occurring on September 30th; by contrast, all adults had permanently departed by the end of July. These results inform future hypotheses about post-breeding movements in Tree Swallows. But, more generally, the detection of tagged swallows on their distant wintering grounds, seven months after tagging, indicates the potential of studying small passerine movements throughout their entire lifetimes, and suggests a rich array of applications for these "Life Tags" to study the movements of small animals world-wide.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE PNEUCHAIR: PNEUMATIC-POWERED WHEELCHAIR	TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION			English	Article						Assistive technology; Mobility device; Air power	ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES; FUEL-CELL; DESIGN; REPAIRS; PEOPLE	The lead-acid batteries currently used in powered wheelchairs are heavy, costly to replace, and require long recharge times. Although alternative battery chemistries are available that address some of these issues, they are more expensive and raise concerns about their safety, reliability, and compatibility with powered wheelchairs. Prototypes using alternatives such as solar power, fuel cells, and super capacitors have been developed, yet the feasibility of such devices being commercialized is low. This study focused on using pneumatic power as an alternative energy source in a powered wheelchair called the PneuChair. A participatory action design approach was applied throughout the study, where two sets of focus groups gathered feedback from end-users and mobility device professionals about the conceptual design of the PneuChair and their experiences using the PneuChair at a wheelchair accessible waterpark. The PneuChair was also tested using applicable ANSI/ISO Wheelchair Standards tests. The PneuChair features a tubular aluminum frame driven with a pneumatic joystick. A manufactured prototype passed the applicable ANSI/ISO Wheelchair Standards tests, and the results were equivalent to those of Group 2 electric-powered wheelchairs. As a result, pneumatic power is a feasible alternative energy source for powered wheelchairs that is safer, lighter weight, waterproof, and capable of being quickly recharged in 10 minutes.

Impact of Ligand Substitutions on Multielectron Redox Properties of Fe Complexes Supported by Nitrogenous Chelates	ACS OMEGA			English	Article							TRANSITION-METAL-COMPLEXES; DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL THEORY; SENSITIZED SOLAR-CELLS; BIS(IMINO)PYRIDINE IRON; FLOW BATTERIES; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; NON-INNOCENT; CHROMIUM COMPLEXES; IONIC-SOLUTIONS; SPIN-CROSSOVER	Redox flow batteries (RFBs) have recently been recognized as a potentially viable technology for scalable energy storage. To take full advantage of RFBs, one possible approach for achieving high energy densities is to maximize a number of redox events by utilizing charge carriers capable of multiple one-electron transfers within the electrochemical window of solvent. However, past efforts to develop more efficient electrolytes for nonaqueous RFBs have mostly been empirical. In this manuscript, we shed light on design principles by theoretically investigating the effects of systematically substituting pyridyl moieties with imine ligands within a series of Fe complexes with some experimental validation. We found that such replacement is an effective strategy for reducing the molecular weight-to-charge ratios of these complexes. Simultaneously, calculations suggest that the reduction potentials and ligand-based redox activity of such substituted N-heterocyclic Fe compounds might be maintained within their +4 -> -1 charge states. Additionally, by theoretically examining the role of coordination geometry, vis-a-vis reducing the number of redox noninnocent ligands within the first coordination sphere, we have demonstrated that Fe complexes with one such ligand were also capable of supporting multielectron reduction events and exhibited reduction potentials similar to their parent analogs supported by two or three of the same multidentate ligands. However, some differences in redox nature within the lower (+2 -> -1) charge states were also noticed. Specifically, complexes containing two bidentate ligands, or one tridentate ligand, exhibited ligand-based reductions, whereas compounds with one bidentate ligand exhibited metal-centered reductions. The current results pave the way toward the design of the next-generation of Fe complexes with lower molecular weights and greater stored energy for redox flow batteries.

A Unified Control and Power Management Scheme for PV-Battery-Based Hybrid Microgrids for Both Grid-Connected and Islanded Modes	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID			English	Article						Solar PV system; battery; control and power management system; distributed energy resource; microgrid; power electronics; dSPACE	ENERGY MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM; OPTIMIZATION; DESIGN; MPPT	Battery storage is usually employed in photovoltaic (PV) system to mitigate the power fluctuations due to the characteristics of PV panels and solar irradiance. Control schemes for PV-battery systems must be able to stabilize the bus voltages as well as to control the power flows flexibly. This paper proposes a comprehensive control and power management system (CAPMS) for PV-battery-based hybrid microgrids with both ac and dc buses, for both grid-connected and islanded modes. The proposed CAPMS is successful in regulating the dc and ac bus voltages and frequency stably, controlling the voltage and power of each unit flexibly, and balancing the power flows in the systems automatically under different operating circumstances, regardless of disturbances from switching operating modes, fluctuations of irradiance and temperature, and change of loads. Both simulation and experimental case studies are carried out to verify the performance of the proposed method.

A techno-economic feasibility of different system configurations is evaluated and an optimized system is selected using HOMER (Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable) software. The hybrid system is optimized to meet a remote stand-alone village community's load demand of 242.56 kWh/day with a 51.52 kW peak load demand. The result of this study indicates that the optimized hybrid system consists of 73 kW PV arrays, a 57 kW Diesel generator, a 387 kWh nominal capacity battery bank, and 28 kW inverters have the minimum Cost of Energy (COE) of 0.37$/kWh and the Net Present Cost (NPC) of $357,284. The outcome also indicates that the optimized system reduces CO2 emission by around 62% in comparison with the kerosene used in a current situation and 67% with the grid connected system. Furthermore, the Life Cycle Emissions-LCE (kg CO2-eq/yr) production is considerably lower in PV/Batt/ICE system than the other system configurations. However, this system has a lower Duty Factor (DF) compared to Wind/Batt/Diesel and Batt/Diesel based system. Although this system is not comparable with the grid tariff, the proposed method is economically feasible than solar micro utility system, Wind/Batt/Diesel system, and Diesel generator only system. Additionally, the article discusses the social and economic benefits of implementing the hybridized system along with their barriers and challenges. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The cost of reliability in decentralized solar power systems in sub-Saharan Africa	NATURE ENERGY			English	Article							ENERGY-SYSTEMS; ELECTRIFICATION; ELECTRICITY; BATTERY; COUNTRIES; KENYA; GRIDS	Although there is consensus that both grid extensions and decentralized projects are necessary to approach universal electricity access, existing electrification planning models that assess the costs of decentralized solar energy systems do not include metrics of reliability or quantify the impact of reliability on costs. We focus on stand-alone household solar systems with battery storage in sub-Saharan Africa using the fraction of demand served to measure reliability, and develop a multistep optimization to compute efficiently the least-cost system with the fraction of demand served as a design constraint, and take into account the daily variation in solar resources and costs of solar and storage. We show that the cost of energy is minimized at approximately a 90% fraction of demand served, that current costs increase, on average, by US$0.11 kWh(-1) for each additional '9' of reliability, and that this reliability premium could be as low as US$0.03 kWh(-1) in a plausible future price scenario.

Decarbonizing power and transportation at the urban scale: An analysis of the Austin, Texas Community Climate Plan	SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Climate policy; Cities; Decarbonization; Energy modeling; Electricity; Transportation	INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT MODELS; ENERGY; POLICY; ELECTRICITY; CITIES; COST; TECHNOLOGIES; EMISSIONS; VEHICLES; HYDROGEN	Despite the growing importance of cities in climate change mitigation, there remains a dearth of rigorous analysis to inform municipal climate policies and mitigation strategies. Our study addresses this gap in the literature. We develop an energy system optimization model for urban-scale decarbonization, and use it to analyze the Community Climate Plan adopted by Austin, Texas. Austin is a valuable testbed for analysis because it is a member of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group and its goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 is particularly ambitious. We find that this policy objective can be achieved at a modest 2.7% increase in net present power and transportation costs relative to business-as-usual. The optimal decarbonization pathway proceeds through two distinct stages, first reducing power sector emissions, then electrifying transportation. Solar PV expands in the long run with or without the climate plan based on favorable cost projections, but the policy causes wind to replace natural gas as a complement to solar PV. Results also highlight the substantial value of intelligently scheduled battery storage operations and electric vehicle charging.

The energy system model and NREL's HOMER software are used to simulate the microgrid operation and forecast the levelized cost of electricity into the future for each location, with results ranging from 35-52 cents/kWh. This cost/kWh is compared with projected grid electricity prices at each location to determine parity dates. Analysis results reveal that grid parity is primarily a result of higher power prices or unreliable grids rather than declining microgrid costs. For Pakistan, grid parity is already here for microgrids, while Germany hits parity in the 2023-2040 timeframe. Results for South Africa and the US suggest that places with low grid prices hit parity after the year 2040. Sensitivity analysis results reveal the significant impact of financing on the year of grid parity, particularly in developing markets. We also show that policy measures to eliminate uncertainty and improve financing could push this grid parity years or decades earlier in developing economies where such microgrids may find a greater utility at present or in the near future.

J	Laws, ND; Anderson, K; DiOrio, NA; Li, XK; McLaren, J				Laws, Nicholas D.; Anderson, Kate; DiOrio, Nicholas A.; Li, Xiangkun; McLaren, Joyce			Impacts of valuing resilience on cost-optimal PV and storage systems for commercial buildings	RENEWABLE ENERGY			English	Article						Resilience; Renewable energy; Energy storage; Microgrid; Value of lost load	STRATEGY; ENERGY	Decreasing electric grid reliability in the US, along with increasing severe weather events, have greatly increased interest in resilient energy systems. Few studies have included the value of resilience when sizing PV and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), and none have included the cost to island a PV and BESS, grid-connected costs and benefits, and the value of resilience. This work presents a novel method for incorporating the value of resilience provided by a PV and BESS into a techno-economic optimization model. Including the value of resilience in the design of a cost-optimal PV and BESS generally increases the system capacities, and in some cases makes a system economical where it was not before. For example, for a large hotel in Anaheim, CA no system is economical without resilience valued; however, with a $5317/hr value of resilience a 363 kW and 60 kWh solar and BESS provides a net present value of $50,000. Lastly, we discuss the effect of the "islandable premium", which must be balanced against the benefits from serving critical loads during outages. Case studies show that the islandable premium can vary widely, which highlights the necessity for case-by-case solutions in a rapidly developing market. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Integrating heat from a concentrating solar power (CSP) collector field increases the power output at low cost. This article considers five methods of solar heat addition in a double-flash geothermal plant. The most promising solution converts solar heat into electrical work with an efficiency of 24.3%. The economic feasibility and optimal sizing of the solar field and thermal stores are evaluated. A hybrid plant that increases power generation from 22 to 24 MWe has a Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) of 0.07 +/- 0.01 $/kWh(e). Adding three hours of storage increases the LCOE to 0.08 +/- 0.01 $/kWh(e). Photovoltaic systems are considered to be a low-cost renewable technology, but an equivalent photovoltaic system with battery storage costs 0.15 +/- 0.07 $/kWh(e) due to the high cost and replacement rate of batteries compared to thermal storage. The hybrid plant also has a lower LCOE than a conventional CSP plant. If the dispatchability that thermal storage provides is rewarded with higher electricity prices, calculations indicate storage becomes an attractive investment when discharged power receives 1.75 times the typical price of electricity.

This review paper summarizes the end-user economics of battery and load control technologies that increase the value of PV by controlling and temporally shifting PV output, an approach referred to as "solar plus." Solar plus can increase on-site PV use. The literature shows that these values justify the incremental costs of solar plus devices for a wide variety of technologies, geographies, and customer load profiles, especially for customers in three rate structure contexts: where PV is sold to the grid at a lower value than the customer's retail rate, in time-of-use rates where peak periods do not coincide with PV output, and in demand charge rates where load peaks do not coincide with PV output. Rate structure and policy reform may be necessary to ensure that increasing solar plus deployment provides both end-user and system-level benefits.

Rice husk biomass was initially utilized to produce bulk materials for conventional applications while a variety of advanced nanostructures (NSs) have been fabricated over the past few years. In addition to their low cost and environmental friendliness, RH-derived NSs (RH-NSs) exhibit versatile properties, which are promising for broad applications in various fields. In this Review, we summarize the latest research on RH-NSs, covering their design, fabrication, properties, and applications in the modern energy field. Based on the unique structure and components of RHs, a series of carbon/silicon-based novel NSs with outstanding performances have been exploited, which are difficult to be synthesized using conventional chemical reagents. We also discuss perspective uses of RH-NSs on the basis of the current research progress.

The mass production of low-cost devices and components such as environmental sensors, bio-sensors, actuators, lab on chip (LOCs), radio frequency identification (RFID) smart tags, light emitting diodes (LEDs), smart fabrics and labels, wallpaper, solar cells, fuel cells, and batteries are major driving factors for the industry. Using renewable and bio-friendly materials would be advantageous for both manufacturers and consumers with the increased use of (FHPE) electronics in our daily lives. This review article describes recent developments in cellulose and nanocellulose-based materials for FHPE, and the necessary developments required to propagate their use in commercial applications. The aim of these developments is to enable the creation of FHPE devices and components made almost entirely of cellulose materials.

J	Khalaf, AF; Wang, Y				Khalaf, Alireza Fazli; Wang, Yong			Energy-cost-aware flow shop scheduling considering intermittent renewables, energy storage, and real-time electricity pricing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH			English	Article						energy storage; energy-cost-aware manufacturing; real-time pricing; renewable energy; 2-stage stochastic programming	DEMAND-SIDE MANAGEMENT; DATA CENTERS; OPTIMIZATION; GENERATION; SYSTEMS	The industrial sector is one of the major energy consumers that contribute to global climate change. Demand response programs and on-site renewable energy provide great opportunities for the industrial sector to both go green and lower production costs. In this paper, a 2-stage stochastic flow shop scheduling problem is proposed to minimize the total electricity purchase cost. The energy demand of the designed manufacturing system is met by on-site renewables, energy storage, as well as the supply from the power grid. The volatile price, such as day-ahead and real-time pricing, applies to the portion supplied by the power grid. The first stage of the formulated model determines optimal job schedules and minimizes day-ahead purchase commitment cost that considers forecasted renewable generation. The volatility of the real-time electricity price and the variability of renewable generation are considered in the second stage of the model to compensate for errors of the forecasted renewable supply; the model will also minimize the total cost of real-time electricity supplied by the real-time pricing market and maximize the total profit of renewable fed into the grid. Case study results show that cost savings because of on-site renewables are significant. Seasonal cost saving differences are also observed. The cost saving in summer is higher than that in winter with solar and wind supply in the system. Although the battery system also contributes to the cost saving, its effect is not as significant as the renewables.

As a symbolic example, concrete is the most widely used synthetic material on the planet. This large consumption entails significant negative environmental footprint, which calls for innovative strategies to develop greener concrete with improved properties (to do more with less). Herein, we focus on the physicochemical properties of novel spherical calcium silicate particles with an extremely narrow size distribution and report their promising potential as fundamental building blocks. We demonstrate a scalable size shape-controlled synthesis protocol to yield highly spherical CS submicron particles, leading to favorable aggregation mechanisms and thus self-assembly of the bulk ensemble. This optimized kinetics-controlled synthesis is governed by suitable stoichiometric ratio of calcium over silicon, type and concentration of the surfactant, and molar ratio of the alkaline solution. Our extensive nano/micro/macro-characterization results show that the bulk ensemble exhibits many superior properties, such as improved strength, toughness, ductility, and durability, paving the path for bottom-up science-based engineering of concrete.

J	Lee, CW; Schleife, A				Lee, Cheng-Wei; Schleife, Andre			Electronic stopping and proton dynamics in InP, GaP, and In0.5Ga0.5P from first principles	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B			English	Article							VAPOR-PHASE EPITAXY; TANDEM SOLAR-CELLS; LONG-RANGE ORDER; TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE; SEMICONDUCTOR ALLOYS; RADIATION-DAMAGE; BAND-GAP; ENERGY; CRYSTALS; SUPERLATTICES	The phosphide-based III-V semiconductors InP, GaP, and In0.5Ga0.5P are promising materials for solar panels in outer space and radioisotope batteries, for which lifetime is a major issue. In order to understand high radiation tolerance of these materials and improve it further, it is necessary to describe the early stages of radiation damage on fast time and short length scales. In particular, the influence of atomic ordering, as observed e.g. in In0.5Ga0.5P, on electronic stopping is unknown. We use real-time time-dependent density functional theory and the adiabatic local density approximation to simulate electronic stopping of protons in InP, GaP, and the CuAu-I ordered phase of In0.5Ga0.5P across a large kinetic energy range. These results are compared to SRIM and we investigate the dependence on the channel of the projectile through the target. We show that stopping can be enhanced or reduced in In0.5Ga0.5P and explain this using the electron-density distribution. By comparing Ehrenfest and Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics, we illustrate the intricate dynamics of a proton on a channeling trajectory.

However, the routes commonly employed in their synthesis present synthetic bottlenecks with reliance on sacrificial materials, the use of high temperatures, long reaction times, and little ability to control morphology, thus compromising their scaleup. Herein, we present the single-pot, electrochemical synthesis of high surface area, doped metal titanate nanostructures, including Na2Ti3O7 (NTO), 25 wt % Sn:NTO, 5 wt % Fe:NTO, and 3 wt % Cu:NTO. The synergistic use of the cathodic corrosion method with suspended droplet alloying (SDA) led to materials with excellent homogeneity, presenting a promising route for the screening, production, and discovery of electroactive materials. As proof of concept of the synthetic control and impact on reactivity, we found that the photoanodic oxygen evolution activity of the nanomaterials was adversely affected by Fe and Sn doping into NTO while Cu doping, at 3 wt %, displayed significant improvement. This work demonstrates the ability of the cathodic corrosion method to obtain compositionally and structurally controlled mixed-metal oxides in a rapid fashion, thus creating new opportunities in the field of materials engineering and the systematic study of compositional gradients on the (photo)electrochemical performance of metal oxide nanoparticles.

Review of electrical energy storage technologies, materials and systems: challenges and prospects for large-scale grid storage	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Review							OXIDE FUEL-CELLS; REDOX-FLOW BATTERIES; ELECTROCHEMICAL AMMONIA-SYNTHESIS; METAL-AIR BATTERIES; RECHARGEABLE LITHIUM BATTERIES; HIGH-TEMPERATURE ELECTROLYSIS; ATOMIC LAYER DEPOSITION; ACTIVE EDGE SITES; LI ION CONDUCTORS; ALL-SOLID-STATE	Increased interest in electrical energy storage is in large part driven by the explosive growth in intermittent renewable sources such as wind and solar as well as the global drive towards decarbonizing the energy economy. However, the existing electrical grid systems in place globally are not equipped to handle mass scale integration of intermittent energy sources without serious disruptions to the grid. It is generally agreed that more than 20% penetration from intermittent renewables can greatly destabilize the grid system. Certainly, large-scale electrical energy storage systems may alleviate many of the inherent inefficiencies and deficiencies in the grid system, and help improve grid reliability, facilitate full integration of intermittent renewable sources, and effectively manage power generation. Electrical energy storage offers two other important advantages. First, it decouples electricity generation from the load or electricity user, thus making it easier to regulate supply and demand. Second, it allows distributed storage opportunities for local grids, or microgrids, which greatly improve grid security, and hence, energy security. Currently, there is only 170 GW of installed storage capacity around the world, but more than 96% is provided by pumped-hydro, which is site-constrained and not available widely. Hence, a battery of technologies is needed to fully address the widely varying needs for large-scale electrical storage. The focus of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of a broad portfolio of electrical energy storage technologies, materials and systems, and present recent advances and progress as well as challenges yet to overcome. The article discusses the status and options for mechanical, thermal, electrochemical, and chemical storage. Where appropriate, it also provides tutorial level background information on fundamental principles for the interested non-expert. It is hoped that this article is of interest to the uninitiated as well as active scientists and engineers engaged in energy storage technologies, with particular focus on large-scale electrical energy storage.

However, the highly complex and delicate biological structures have restricted the huge electrical energy in practical applications. Herein, we report the spontaneous electric generation of a functional groups-reconfigured graphene oxide membrane in ambient atmosphere, which was prepared by a directionally-induced thermal reduction strategy. The as-prepared asymmetric porous graphene oxide membrane (a-GOM) with a size of only 4 mm(2) can proactively generate a sustained electrical voltage of up to 450 mV in air without the need of external stimuli such as mechanical movement, light, heat, and liquid water. Of practical importance, it is easy to reach a high voltage of more than 10 V by simple series stacking of a-GOM units, powering many commercial electronic components such as liquid crystal displays (LCD) and light-emitting diodes (LED). In addition, flexible and foldable power generation devices having soft package technology (being used for the fabrication of commercial lithium-ion batteries) are achievable on the basis of the assembly of a-GOM units.

Instead of the traditional ground soil-moisture measurement, the leaf sensing is a new technology, which is used for the detection of plants needing water. In this paper, a novel, low-cost, and low-power system for leaf sensing using a new plant backscatter sensor node/tag is presented. The latter, can result in the prevention of water waste (water-use efficiency), when is connected to an irrigation system. Specifically, the sensor measures the temperature differential between the leaf and the air, which is directly related to the plant water stress. Next, the tag collects the information from the leaf sensor through an analog-to-digital converter, and then, communicates remotely with a low-cost software-defined radio reader using monostatic backscatter architecture. The tag consists of the sensor board, a microcontroller, an external timer, and an RF front-end for communication. The timer produces a subcarrier frequency for simultaneous access of multiple tags. The proposed work could be scaled and be a part of a large backscatter wireless sensor network. The communication protocol exploits the low-complexity Morse code modulation on a 868 MHz carrier signal. The presented novel proof-of-consent prototype is batteryless and was powered by a flexible solar panel consuming power around 20 mu W. The performance was validated in an indoors environment where wireless communication was successfully achieved up to 2 m distance.

Herein, we report the judicious design of ETL composed of edge-enriched graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and TiO2 nanocrystals to enable markedly improved charge carrier conductivity and, more importantly, well-aligned energy levels at the perovskite/ETL/fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) interfaces for imparting the cascade charge transfer, thereby leading to improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs. The investigation into the influence of the GNR content within ETL on device performance demonstrated that excessive GNRs are detrimental for charge transfer as they block the contact between TiO2 and perovskite. In contrast to devices using pure TiO2 as ETL with a PCE of 15.87%, the PSCs employing GNRs-incorporated ETL display the improved photovoltaic performance with a highest PCE of 17.69%, a steady-state efficiency output of 17.05%, and a reduced current-voltage hysteresis. Subsequently, a systematic photo-carrier dynamics study revealed that the performance enhancement was a direct consequence of (a) the promoted fill factor and open circuit voltage due to the improved electron diffusion coefficient and the longer charge recombination time, (b) the increased charge collection efficiency owing to the cascade charge transfer from TiO2 to GNRs to FTO electrode, resulting in a higher external quantum efficiency and thus a larger short circuit current density and (c) the suppressed current-voltage hysteresis ascribed to the increased charge transfer noted above. Finally, a markedly improved long-term stability was manifested. As such, the rational incorporation of edge-enriched GNRs represents a feasible and robust strategy to formulate promising ETLs for high-efficiency and stable PSCs.

However, the performance of photocharging devices is usually restricted by small voltage plateau and low energy conversion efficiency. Herein, we report a novel "solar capacitor" realized by combining a CsPbBr3 based all-inorganic perovskite solar cell (PSC) and an all-inorganic silica-gel-electrolyte based supercapacitor into a single device. Benefited from the synergy of these two components, the solar capacitor can simultaneously realize the functions of solar power harvesting and electrochemical energy storage without the aid of galvanostatic charging. This device has the merits of compact structure, very fast photocharging rate and high stability, exhibiting a record voltage plateau of 1.2 V and a remarkable overall "photo-electrochemical-electricity" energy conversion efficiency of 5.1%. This work provides new insights for designing novel energy conversion-storage integrated systems.

Kinetic simulation of magnetic field generation and collisionless shock formation in expanding laboratory plasmas	PHYSICS OF PLASMAS			English	Article							ELECTRON ACCELERATION; SOLAR-WIND; RECONNECTION; TRANSPORT; ORIGIN	Recent laboratory experiments with laser-produced plasmas have observed and studied a number of fundamental physical processes relevant to magnetized astrophysical plasmas, including magnetic reconnection, collisionless shocks, and magnetic field generation by Weibel instability, opening up new experimental platforms for laboratory astrophysics. We develop a fully kinetic simulation model for first-principles simulation of these systems including the dynamics of magnetic fields-magnetic field generation by the Biermann battery effect or Weibel instability; advection by the ion flow, Hall effect, and Nernst effect; and destruction of the field by dissipative mechanisms. Key dimensionless parameters describing the system are derived for scaling between kinetic simulation, recent experiments, and astrophysical plasmas. First, simulations are presented which model Biermann battery magnetic field generation in plasmas expanding from a thin target. Ablation of two neighboring plumes leads to the formation of a current sheet as the opposing Biermann-generated fields collide, modeling recent laser-driven magnetic reconnection experiments. Second, we simulate recent experiments on collisionless magnetized shock generation, by expanding a piston plasma into a pre-magnetized ambient plasma. For parameters considered, the Biermann effect generates additional magnetic fields in the curved shock front and thereby increases shock particle reflection. Both cases show the importance of kinetic processes in the interaction of plasmas with magnetic fields and open opportunities to benchmark these important processes through comparison of theory and experiments.

Monitoring snowbank processes and cornice fall avalanches with time-lapse photography	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Snowbank; Cornice; Avalanche; Time-lapse photography	CENTRAL SVALBARD; NIVATION; DYNAMICS	Time-lapse photography was employed to monitor a snowbank at 3640 m above sea level in the Uinta Mountains, Utah, USA. The snowbank forms against a 35-m high, east-facing escarpment and is nourished by wind redistribution of snow from an alpine plateau. The snowbank is capped by a large cornice, and its central core persists through the summer in most years. An automated, solar-powered digital camera was deployed between October 2016 and June 2017, and programmed to capture 5 photographs each day between 8:00 and 16:00, local time. Although cold temperatures affected the batteries during the winter, a total of 812 photographs were collected, for an overall average of 3.4 per day. These images were combined in an animation displaying the growth of the snowbank and associated cornice over the course of the winter. The debris fields resulting from nineteen cornice fall avalanches were noted in the sequence of photographs. Data collected at a nearby automated weather station reveal that 12 avalanches (between early December and early April) were preceded by significant increases in snow depth, snow water equivalent, and precipitation, with sustained windspeeds above the winter average. In contrast, six of the last seven events (between late April and early June) occurred in the absence of new snowfall, but were associated with rapid rises in temperature and notable decreases in snow water equivalent. The average interval between recorded avalanches is 10 days, with a maximum of 29 days and a minimum of 2 h. Recurrence intervals were shorter in December/January, in late March/ early April, and in late April/early May. Only one avalanche occurred in the 56 days between 27 January and 24 March. Time-lapse photography is a powerful tool for monitoring nival processes.

Multiport Bidirectional SRM Drives for Solar-Assisted Hybrid Electric Bus Powertrain With Flexible Driving and Self-Charging Functions	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Boosted dc voltage; multiport bidirectional converter; photovoltaics (PV); solar hybrid electric bus (SHEB); switched reluctance motor (SRM)	RELUCTANCE MOTOR DRIVE; HIGH DEMAGNETIZATION VOLTAGE; FRONT-END; CONVERTER; VEHICLES; MODE; ELECTRONICS; MAGNETS; HEV	The hybrid electric bus (HEB) presents an emerging solution to exhaust gas emissions in urban transport. This paper proposes a multiport bidirectional switched reluctance motor (SRM) drive for solar-assisted HEB (SHEB) powertrain, which not only improves the motoring performance, but also achieves flexible charging functions. To extend the driving miles and achieve self-charging ability, photovoltaic (PV) panels are installed on the bus to decrease the reliance on fuels/batteries and charging stations, A bidirectional front-end circuit with a PV-fed circuit is designed to integrate electrical components into one converter. Six driving and five charging modes are achieved. The dc voltage is boosted by the battery in generator control unit (GCU) driving mode and by the charge capacitor in battery driving mode, where the torque capability is improved. Usually, an extra converter is needed to achieve battery charging. In this paper, the battery can be directly charged by the demagnetization current in GCU or PV driving mode, and can be quickly charged by the PV panels and GCU/AC grids at SHEB standstill conditions, by utilizing the traction motor windings and integrated converter circuit, without external charging converters. Experiments on a three-phase 12/8 SRM confirm the effectiveness of the proposed drive and control scheme.

A nanogrid testbed, containing PV as the power supply, twenty EV charging stations, a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), and a smart-inverter is connected to a primary feeder on the University of California, Irvine (UCI) Microgrid. We present four different smart-inverter control algorithms that govern battery dispatch for different energy management goals. The control algorithms were evaluated with respect to four figures of merit: (1) Renewable Penetration, (2) Voltage Profiles, (3) Net Power Flows, and (4) PV curtailed. A steady-state power flow model of the nanogrid was developed to study the local power quality. The control algorithms were able to successfully use the battery to shift the nanogrid peak load and also limit the nanogrid demand to a given threshold.

The net achievable power and energy densities of such miniatured rechargeable energy storage systems are largely dominated by internal hardware and external packaging materials. Similarly, temperature stability of electrochemically active materials and packaging components is also crucial to realize desired activity at few millimeter scale devices. Herein, we explore energy storage devices at tunable miniatured scale by selecting optimal electroactive materials, thermally stable packaging components, and their fabrication process. Further, an assembled device is subjected to evaluate its energy and power density per foot-print-area along with other key electrochemical parameters such as internal resistance, self-discharge, and thermal stability. Detailed studies reveal that the presently packaged millimeter size rechargeable batteries (2 mm-5 mm) have the ability to work up to 120 degrees C with minimal load loss and compatible with energy harvesting renewable source of the solar cell.

Solar Charged Redox Flow Battery: A Tandem Photoelectrochemical Approach	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							ELECTROCHEMICAL ENERGY-STORAGE; SAUR VIDDYUT KOSH; PRUSSIAN BLUE; N-GAP; CONVERSION EFFICIENCY; SATURATED CACL2; WATER OXIDATION; THIN-FILMS; CELLS; ELECTRODES	A tandem two photoelectrode cell separated by a proton exchange membrane for simultaneous conversion of solar energy into both chemical and electrical energy was investigated by illumination of both a large bandgap photoanode, to produce a highly oxidized species, and a narrow bandgap photocathode, to produce a highly reduced species. The two photoelectrode configuration provides higher photovoltages than a single semiconducting material while also absorbing complementary portions of the solar spectrum leading to potentially higher energy conversion efficiencies. Utilization of kinetically fast redox couples overcomes the overpotential barriers required for water splitting as well as the difficulties associated with gas collection and transport. Additionally, the photopotentials obtained show that not only does this configuration not require external bias but excess electrical power could also be produced in addition to the storage of chemical energy. These experiments demonstrate the feasibility for highly efficient solar energy conversion by directly photocharging a redox flow battery. (C) The Author(s) 2018. Published by ECS.

The efficient synthetic protocols on phase structure evolution and dynamic decomposition behavior enable the production of the Fe1-xS/Fe3C-NCNT hybrid with advanced structural and electronic properties, in which the Fe vacancy contained Fe1-xS showed the 3d metallic state electrons and an electroactive Fe in +2/+3 valence, and the electronic structure of the CNT was effectively modulated by the incorporated Fe3C and N, with the work function decreased from 4.85 to 4.63 eV. The meticulous structural, electronic, and compositional control unveils the unusual synergetic catalytic properties for the Fe1-xS/Fe3C-NCNT hybrid when developed as counter electrodes (CEs) for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), in which the Fe3C- and N incorporated CNTs with reduced work function and increased charge density provide a highway for electron transport and facilitate the electron migration from Fe3C-NCNTs to ultrahigh active Fe1-xS with the electron-donating effect, and the Fe vacancy-enriched Fe1-xS nanoparticles exhibit ultrahigh I-3(-) adsorption and charge-transfer ability. As a consequence, the DSSC based on the Fe1-xS/Fe3C-NCNT CE delivers a high power conversion efficiency of 8.67% and good long-term stability with a remnant efficiency of 8.00% after 168 h of illumination, superior to those of traditional Pt. Furthermore, the possible catalytic mechanism toward I-3(-) reduction is creatively proposed based on the structure-activity correlation. In this work, the structure engineering, electronic modulation, and composition control opens up new possibilities electrocatalytic nanoarchitecture for highly efficient CEs in DSSCs.

Next generation transparent conducting electrodes (TCEs) are required to be inexpensive, lightweight, scalable, and compatible with flexible substrates to trigger innovations towards supporting sustainable living and reducing energy consumption. Here we show that PEDOT:PSS can be solution processed using blade coating and subsequently post-treated with nitric and acetic acid to raise its conductivity above 2000 S cm(-1) with a film transparency of similar to 95%. A combined grazing-incidence scattering, atomic force microscopy, and thickness analysis of the film indicates that the removal of excess insulating PSS- inducing reordering is the critical parameter for the claimed conductivity increase. We then investigate the impact of replacing indium tin oxide electrodes with PEDOT:PSS in ECDs. While electrochromic contrast and optical memory are comparable for devices constructed with both electrode materials, differences in switching kinetics are explored by comparing internal resistances, ion diffusion, and charging effects in the polymer films extracted by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. While all these ideas are described based on a battery-type ECD configuration, these concepts are easily transferable to other types of redox-active devices.

This task, however, is highly challenging experimentally, because an adsorbing carbon surface may easily conceal its intrinsic reactivity through adventitious contamination. Herein, we employ nanoscale scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) and cyclic voltammetry to gain new insights into the interplay between heterogeneous ET and adsorption of a Co(III)/Co(II)-complex redox couple at the contamination-free surface of electron-beam-deposited carbon (eC). Specifically, we investigate the redox couple of tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt(II), Co(phen)(3)(2+), as a promising mediator for dye-sensitized solar cells and redox flow batteries. A pristine eC surface overlaid with KC1 is prepared in vacuum, protected from contamination in air, and exposed to an ultrapure aqueous solution of Co(phen)(3)(2+) by the dissolution of the protective KC1 layer. We employ SECM-based nanogap voltammetry to quantitatively demonstrate that Co(phen)(3)(2+) is adsorbed on the pristine eC surface to electrostatically self-inhibit outer-sphere ET of nonadsorbed Co(phen)(3)(3+) and Co(phen)(3)(2+). Strong electrostatic repulsion among Co(phen)(3)(2+) adsorbates is also demonstrated by SECM-based nanogap voltammetry and cyclic voltammetry. Quantitatively, self-inhibitory ET is characterized by a linear decrease in the standard rate constant of Co(phen)(3)(2+) oxidation with a higher surface concentration of Co(phen)(3)(2+) at the formal potential. This unique relationship is consistent not with the Frumkin model of double layer effects, but with the Amatore model of partially blocked electrodes as extended for self-inhibitory ET. Significantly, the complicated coupling of electron transfer and surface adsorption is resolved by combining nanoscale and macroscale voltammetric methods.

Such thin film devices typically exhibit a multi-phase microstructure that is confined, and show large anisotropy. Current approaches to microstructure design focus on optimizing bulk properties, by tuning features that are statistically averaged over a representative volume. Here, we report a tool for morphogenesis posed as a graph-based optimization problem that evolves microstructures recognizing confinement and anisotropy constraints. We illustrate the approach by designing optimized morphologies for photovoltaic applications, and evolve an initial morphology into an optimized morphology exhibiting substantially improved short circuit current (68% improvement over a conventional bulk-heterojunction morphology). We show optimized morphologies across a range of thicknesses exhibiting self-similar behavior. Results suggest that thicker films (250 nm) can be used to harvest more incident energy. Our graph based morphogenesis is broadly applicable to microstructure-sensitive design of batteries, biosensors and related applications.

However, there is currently no efficient method that is able to tune the band gap of graphene sheets. This work adopts an efficient atomic layer oxidation (ALO) technique to cyclically increase the oxidation level of graphene sheets, thus, tuning their electrical conductance, band-gap structure, and photoluminescence (PL) response. The O/C atomic ratio as an increasing function of the ALO cycle number reflects two linear regions: 0.23% per cm(2) per cycle (0-15 cycles) and 0.054% per cm(2) per cycle (15-100 cycles). The excellent correlation coefficients reveal that the ALO process follows a self-limiting route to step-by-step oxidize graphene layers. The interlayer distance of ALO-graphene sheets shows an obvious increase after the ALO treatment, proved by X-ray diffraction. As analyzed by X-ray photon spectroscopy, the hydroxyl or epoxy group acts as a major contributor to the interlayer spacing distance and oxidation extent in the initial ALO stage, as compared to carbonyl and carboxyl groups. The ALO mechanism, based on Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Eley-Rideal models, is proposed to clarify the formation of oxygen functionalities and structural transformation from pristine graphene sheets to oxidized ones during the ALO cycle. With a tunable oxidation level, the electrical resistivity, semiconductor character, and PL response of ALO-graphene samples can be systematically controlled for desired applications. The ALO approach is capable of offering a straightforward route to tune the oxidation level of graphene sheets or other carbons.

In this work, the broadband electrochromic properties of Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) and its suitability for infrared camouflage and thermoregulation are investigated. Upon Li+ intercalation, LTO changes from a wide bandgap semiconductor to a metal, causing LTO nanoparticles on metal to transition from a super-broadband optical reflector to a solar absorber and thermal emitter. Large tunabilities of 0.74, 0.68, and 0.30 are observed for the solar reflectance, mid-wave infrared (MWIR) emittance, and long-wave infrared (LWIR) emittance, respectively, with a tunability of 0.43 observed for a wavelength of 10 mu m. The values exceed, or are comparable to notable performances in the literature. A promising cycling stability is also observed. MWIR and LWIR thermography reveal that the emittance of LTO-based electrodes can be electrochemically tuned to conceal them amidst their environment. Moreover, under different sky conditions, LTO shows promising solar heating and subambient radiative cooling capabilities depending on the degree of lithiation and device design. The demonstrated capabilities of LTO make electrochromic devices based on LTO highly promising for infrared-camouflage applications in the defense sector, and for thermoregulation in space and terrestrial environments.

In this context, molecular design offers the exciting possibility to create tunable and inexpensive organic electroactive materials. Here we describe a porous structure composed of perylene diimide and triptycene subunits and demonstrate its remarkable performance as a pseudocapacitor electrode material. The material exhibits capacitance values as high as 350 F/g at 0.2 A/g as well as excellent stability over 10 000 cycles. Moreover, we can alter the performance of the material, from battery-like (storing more charge at low rates) to capacitor-like (faster charge cycling), by modifying the structure of the pores via flow photocyclization. Organic materials capable of stable electron accepting pseudocapacitor behavior are rare and the capacitance values presented here are among the highest reported. More broadly, this work establishes molecular design and synthesis as a powerful approach for creating tunable energy storage materials.

Because all these electronic devices require energy to operate, wearable energy systems are an integral part of wearable devices. Essentially, the electrodes and other components present in these energy devices should be mechanically strong, flexible, lightweight, and comfortable to the user. Presented here is a critical review of those materials and devices developed for energy conversion and storage applications with an objective to be used in wearable devices. The focus is mainly on the advances made in the field of solar cells, triboelectric generators, Li-ion batteries, and supercapacitors for wearable device development. As these devices need to be attached/integrated with the fabric, the discussion is limited to devices made in the form of ribbons, filaments, and fibers. Some of the important challenges and future directions to be pursued are also highlighted.

This paper reviews various synthesis approaches of nitrogen-doped graphene (N-G) and nitrogen doped graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs).; Thermal, ultrasonic, solvothermal, hydrothermal, and electron beam methods have been applied to synthesize N-G and N-GQDs. These nitrogen-doped carbon materials are characterized to obtain their structural configurations in order to achieve better performance in their applications compared to only either graphene or graphene quantum dots. Both N-G and N-GQDs may be converted into functional materials by integrating with other compounds such as metal oxides/nitrides, polymers, and semiconductors. These functional materials demonstrate superior performance over N-G and N-GQDs materials. Examples of applications of N-G and N-GQDs include supercapacitors, batteries, sensors, fuel cells, solar cells, and photocatalyst. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

CURRENT OPINION IN CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			English	Review							EMISSION-FREE GENERATION; PARTICLE DEPOSITION; CYCLONE REACTOR; FLOW; ZIRCONIA	There has been extensive R&D on thermochemical production of hydrogen and synthesis gas via concentrated solar energy. A major objective of these efforts was to generate fuel for ground transportation, either as synthetic liquid fuel via Fischer-Tropsch or as pure hydrogen for fuel cell vehicles as compressed gas on board. In parallel, batteries for use in electric vehicles have made substantial progress primarily with respect to their energy density and charging time. This paper explores which sun-to-wheel route is more promising in terms of energy efficiency. The results show the surprisingly explicit conclusion that the solar-to-electricity route is superior indicating the need to improve solar conversion efficiencies of the current commercial photovoltaic and steam cycle technologies. One promising way to achieve this goal is via solar cracking of natural gas to produce hydrogen gas and solid carbon for use as fuels in hydrogen fuel cells and carbon fuel cells with a total potential efficiency that is significantly higher than photovoltaic and steam cycle based technologies.

The paper also reviews on various faults in the solar PV energy conversion process and provides suitable solutions for each circumstance. Simulations are undertaken in MATLAB 2016a/Simulink and experimental investigation is carried out for a 3 kWp solar PV system.

PORTABLE BATTERY POWER AND SMALL-RESERVOIR MODIFICATIONS FOR PESTICIDE MISTING SYSTEMS	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION			English	Article						Pesticide misting application; vector control; botanical; space spray; automatic chemical applicator		United States military personnel deployed in austere hot-arid, temperate, and tropical conditions in remote locations worldwide rely on the Department of Defense (DoD) Pest Management System measures such as application of pesticide residual and ultra-low-volume or thermal fog treatments for protection from routine exposure to nuisance and disease-vector insects. Timed pesticide misting systems originally developed for residential outdoor use show promise as potential enhancements to standard DoD Pest Management System measures, in particular to protect perimeters surrounding US military field encampments. To investigate the capabilities of misting systems in remote locations in diverse environments, this technical engineering report describes the development of 2 key modifications to a commercial residential misting system to enable us to operate the system away from a standard power grid, and to safely operate the system with small volumes of a variety of pesticide misting formulations.

This article examines how solar PV power is currently positioned in the electricity marketplace and how that position is likely to evolve in the foreseeable future. We first assess the current cost competitiveness of solar PV in select U.S. locations and industry segments using the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) metric. This framework enables us to quantify the effects that supportive public policies, time-of-use pricing, and anticipated future technological improvements have on the cost of solar PV. We also build on recent analytical work that has identified circumstances under which it becomes financially attractive to add behind-the-meter batteries to an existing PV solar system. Taken together, our findings suggest that solar power, by itself and in conjunction with low cost storage, is positioned to account for a significant and growing share of the overall energy mix.

Therefore, how to minimize the cost of energy harvesting hardware to reduce the network deployment cost, and further optimize the network performance, is still a challenging issue in EHWSNs. In this paper, an energy conserving and transmission radius adaptive (ECTRA) scheme is proposed to reduce the cost and optimize the performance of solar-based EHWSNs. There are two main innovations of the ECTRA scheme. Firstly, an energy conserving approach is proposed to conserve energy and avoid outage for the nodes in hotspots, which are the bottleneck of the whole network. The novelty of this scheme is adaptively rotating the transmission radius. In this way, the nodes with maximum energy consumption are rotated, balancing energy consumption between nodes and reducing the maximum energy consumption in the network. Therefore, the battery storage capacity of nodes and the cost on hardware. Secondly, the ECTRA scheme selects a larger transmission radius for rotation when the node can absorb enough energy from the surroundings. The advantages of using this method are: (a) reducing the energy consumption of nodes in near-sink areas, thereby reducing the maximum energy consumption and allowing the node of the hotspot area to conserve energy, in order to prevent the node from outage. Hence, the network deployment costs can be further reduced; (b) reducing the network delay. When a larger transmission radius is used to transmit data in the network, fewer hops are needed by data packet to the sink. After the theoretical analyses, the results show the following advantages compared with traditional method. Firstly, the ECTRA scheme can effectively reduce deployment costs by 29.58% without effecting the network performance as shown in experiment analysis; Secondly, the ECTRA scheme can effectively reduce network data transmission delay by 44-71%; Thirdly, the ECTRA scheme shows a better balance in energy consumption and the maximum energy consumption is reduced by 27.89%; And lastly, the energy utilization rate is effectively improved by 30.09-55.48%.

Small combustion driven heat engines offer high power densities and longer operating durations, and present an opportunity to replace large and heavy chemical batteries. Thermal energy harvesters provide a great opportunity to harness the freely available thermal energy: solar, geothermal, and human body heat. These systems can contribute to significant energy savings when coupled to an existing, larger power generation system (e.g., vehicles and diesel generators) for the purpose of energy recovery. In this review, we discuss technological challenges, opportunities, and recent progress in small length scale energy conversion systems with special focus on free piston devices (engines and expanders) and phase-change driven devices. We discuss in detail four important design considerations that can have significant effect on small length scale device performance.

This inverter has major benefits as it provides better buck/boost characteristics, can regulate the phase angle output, has less harmonic contents, does not require the filter and has high power performance characteristics over the conventional inverter. A single ended primary inductance converter (SEPIC) module used as DC-DC switched power apparatus is employed for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) functions which provide high voltage gain throughout the process. Moreover, a modified power ratio variable step (MPRVS) based perturb & observe (P&O) method has been proposed, as part of the PV MPPT action, which forces the operating point close to the maximum power point (MPP). The proposed controller effectively correlates with the hybrid PV, Wind and battery system and provides integration of distributed generation (DG) with loads under varying operating conditions. The proposed standalone micro grid system is applicable specifically in rural places. The dSPACE real-time hardware platform has been employed to test the proposed micro grid system under varying wind speed, solar irradiation, load cutting and removing conditions etc. The experimental results based on a real-time digital platform, under dynamic conditions, justify the performance of a hybrid PV-Wind micro-grid with Quasi Z-Source inverter topology.

A secondary control is constructed to dispatch energy sources according to user selected setpoints and participation factors. Two sources-an energy storage device and a synchronous generator-are controlled to share active and reactive load burdens. A system load models the difference between solar and wind-powered generation and load. First-order differential equations are written to describe the system, and implemented in Simulink. The model components carry a high level of detail to capture all relevant modes. Systems include an eight-state salient pole synchronous machine, an AC8B regulator, a prime mover, an equivalent p cable, an RL microgrid load, an ideal battery, a simple inverter model, and a detailed LCL filter at the inverter output.

To do so, it is important that the amount of renewable energy in the electricity grid increases. However, there are worries of the capacity of the grid to cope with intermittent energy sources. To assess the feasibility of a 100% renewable energy system in Japan, the authors conducted an hourly simulation of future electricity production based on wind, solar and tidal data. The system was shown to be stable, and the authors calculated the required capacity of electrical batteries that would be necessary to balance such a system.

An outstanding challenge is to create design rules that transform intermittent and non-dispatchable solar energy into persistent, stable, and low-cost power for sensors. These design rules govern optimal system architecture design and optimal power consumption patterns. In previous work, we considered (i) the variability of solar insolation across different time scales (hourly, daily, and seasonal); (ii) the solar cell device characteristics; and (iii) the power consumption of the sensing and communication modules. From these constraints, we described a methodology to calculate the necessary energy storage capacity to reliably power the device over several years. The system size can then be optimized to minimize cost or volume. In this paper, we describe a methodology to improve the reliability of solar-powered IoT devices in the event of outlier conditions (Le., periods of anomalously low insolation that reduce battery state-of-charge). This theoretical study, based on actual sensor and insolation data, describes how an adaptive power consumption scheme decreases the dimensions of solar cell and battery as well as system cost, assuming flexible operating scheme is allowed. The adaptive power consumption scheme means the data acquisition and transmission rate which governs the power consumption profile - changes based on availability of stored energy in the battery and recent solar insolation. The results show for 3% reduction in average data transmission, the cost of the power components (i.e. battery and solar panel) can be reduced by 10% and the volume of the battery by 30%. The design is constrained by the available power as well as the minimum expected system performance, using the rate of acquired data from the sensor. We find that implementing an adaptive power consumption scheme based on available battery capacity for solar powered sensor can reduce battery capacity by 90%, while ensuring that data transmission rate occasionally varies but never extinguishes completely.

Photoelectrodes driving nonspontaneous reversible redox reactions in solar-powered redox cells (SPRCs), which can deliver energy via the corresponding reverse reactions, present a cost-effective and promising approach for direct solar energy harvesting and storage. However, the lack of photoelectrodes having both high conversion efficiency and high durability becomes a bottleneck that hampers practical applications of SPRCs. Here, it is shown that a WO3-decorated BiVO4 photoanode, without the need of extra electrocatalysts, can enable a single-photocatalyst-driven SPRC with a solar-to-output energy conversion efficiency as high as 1.25%. This SPRC presents stable performance over 20 solar energy storage/delivery cycles. The high efficiency and stability are attributed to the rapid redox reactions, the well-matched energy level, and the efficient light harvesting and charge separation of the prepared BiVO4. This demonstrated device system represents a potential alternative toward the development of low-cost, durable, and easy-to-implement solar energy technologies.

Here we examine the ability of dynamic (real-time) pricing in off-grid systems to improve the durability of the batteries used to store power. In a randomized controlled trial with a pre-paid solar micro-grid in rural India, we found that dynamic pricing did not improve technical performance or customer satisfaction. The best explanation for the null finding is that, for various reasons, households minimized their power consumption and there was thus little need for demand management. These findings suggest that the low demand for power is a key challenge for the profitability of pre-paid off-grid systems.

A novel high-frequency groundwater quality monitoring system	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Water quality; Sonde; High frequency; Nitrate; Specific conductance, groundwater	IN-SITU; WATER; DYNAMICS; NITRATE; SENSORS; STREAM; RIVER; TIME	High-frequency, long-term monitoring of water quality has revolutionized the study of surface waters in recent years. However, application of these techniques to groundwater has been limited by the ability to remotely pump and analyze groundwater. This paper describes a novel autonomous groundwater quality monitoring system which samples multiple wells to evaluate temporal changes and identify trends in groundwater chemistry. The system, deployed near Fresno, California, USA, collects and transmits high-frequency data, including water temperature, specific conductance, pH, dissolved oxygen, and nitrate, from supply and monitoring wells, in real-time. The system consists of a water quality sonde and optical nitrate sensor, manifold, submersible three-phase pump, variable frequency drive, data collection platform, solar panels, and rechargeable battery bank. The manifold directs water from three wells to a single set of sensors, thereby reducing setup and operation costs associated with multi-sensor networks. Sampling multiple wells at high frequency for several years provided a means of monitoring the vertical distribution and transport of solutes in the aquifer. Initial results show short period variability of nitrate, specific conductivity, and dissolved oxygen in the shallow aquifer, while the deeper portion of the aquifer remains unchanged-observations that may be missed with traditional discrete sampling approaches. In this aquifer system, nitrate and specific conductance are increasing in the shallow aquifer, while invariant changes in deep groundwater chemistry likely reflect relatively slow groundwater flow. In contrast, systems with high groundwater velocity, such as karst aquifers, have been shown to exhibit higher-frequency groundwater chemistry changes. The stability of the deeper aquifer over the monitoring period was leveraged to develop estimates of measurement system uncertainty, which were typically lower than the manufacturer's stated specifications, enabling the identification of subtle variability in water chemistry that may have otherwise been missed.

Compared to electrochemical batteries, flywheel energy storage systems (ESSs) offer many unique benefits such as low environmental impact, high power quality, and larger life cycles. This paper presents a novel utility-scale flywheel ESS that features a shaftless, hubless flywheel. The unique shaftless design gives it the potential of doubled energy density and a compact form factor. Its energy and power capacities are 100 kWh and 100 kW, respectively. The flywheel is made of high-strength steel, which makes it much easier to manufacture, assemble, and recycle. Steels also cost much less than composite materials. Design and analysis of the shaftless flywheel are presented first. In addition, the system incorporates a new combination active magnetic bearing. Its working principle and levitation control for the flywheel are discussed. The design of an integrated coreless permanent-magnet (PM) motor/generator for the flywheel is given as well. Initial test results show that the magnetic bearing provides stable levitation for the 5443-kg flywheel with small current consumption.

Matching demand with supply at low cost in 139 countries among 20 world regions with 100% intermittent wind, water, and sunlight (WWS) for all purposes	RENEWABLE ENERGY			English	Article						Wind-water-solar; Electric and thermal grid; Electricity and thermal storage; Transmission; Demand response	SECTOR ENERGY ROADMAPS; RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY; SYSTEM; SOLAR; POWER; SCENARIOS; STORAGE; COMBINATIONS; PV	Matching electricity, heat, and cold demand with supply at low cost is the greatest concern facing countries seeking to provide their all-purpose energy with 100% clean, renewable wind, water, and sunlight (WWS). Implementing WWS worldwide could eliminate 4-7 million annual air pollution deaths, first slow then reverse global warming, and provide energy sustainably. This study derives zero-load-loss technical solutions to matching demand with 100% WWS supply; heat, cold, and electricity storage; hydrogen production; assumed all-distance transmission; and demand response for 20 world regions encompassing 139 countries after they electrify or provide direct heat for all energy in 2050. Multiple solutions are found, including those with batteries and heat pumps but zero added hydropower turbines and zero thermal energy storage. Whereas WWS and Business-As-Usual (MU) energy costs per unit energy are similar, WWS requires similar to 42.5% less energy in a base case and similar to 57.9% less in a heat-pump case so may reduce capital and consumer costs significantly. Further, WWS social (energy + health + climate) costs per unit energy are one-fourth BAU's. By reducing water vapor, the wind turbines proposed may rapidly offset similar to 3% global warming while also displacing fossil-fuel emissions. Thus, with careful planning, the world's energy challenges may be solvable with a practical technique. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Integrating solar into Florida's power system: Potential roles for flexibility	SOLAR ENERGY			English	Article						Renewable energy integration; Solar photovoltaics; Battery energy storage; Demand response; Operational flexibility	WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; SOCIAL COST; CARBON; MODEL	Although Florida has very little photovoltaic (PV) generation to date, it is reasonable to expect significant deployment in the 2020s under a variety of future policy and cost scenarios. To understand these potential futures, we model Florida Reliability Coordinating Council operations in 2026 over a wide range of PV penetrations with various combinations of battery storage capacity, demand response, and increased operational flexibility. By calculating the value of PV under a wide range of conditions, we find that at least 5%, and more likely 10-24%, PV penetration is cost competitive in Florida within the next decade with baseline flexibility and all but the most pessimistic of assumptions. For high PV penetrations, we demonstrate Florida's electrical net-load variability (duck curve) challenges, the associated reduction of PV's value to the system, and the ability of flexibility options-in particular energy-shifting resources-to preserve value and increase the economic carrying capacity of PV. A high level of demand response boosts the economic carrying capacity of PV by up to 0.5-2 percentage points, which is comparable to the impact of deploying 1 GW of battery storage. Adding 4 GW of battery storage expands the economic carrying capacity of PV by up to 6 percentage points.

These technologies demand the use of batteries. Sunlight, an abundant clean source of energy, can alleviate the energy limits of batteries, while batteries can address photovoltaic intermittency. This perspective paper focuses on advancing concepts in PV-battery system design while providing critical discussion, review, and prospect. Reports on discrete and integrated PV-battery designs are discussed. Three key technical challenges, namely energy density, efficiency, and stability, toward further advancement of integrated PV-battery systems are discussed. We present a perspective on opportunities and future directions, highlighting key strategies on developing such PV-battery systems. Key focus should be on the development of innovative designs that incorporates high-capacity, efficient, and stable materials, emphasizing the demonstration of practical viability of such integrated PV-battery systems.

However, sensor nodes have limited energy in their primary power storage unit, and this energy may be quickly drained if the sensor node remains operational over long periods of time. Therefore, the idea of harvesting ambient energy from the immediate surroundings of the deployed sensors, to recharge the batteries and to directly power the sensor nodes, has recently been proposed. The deployment of energy harvesting in environmental field systems eliminates the dependency of sensor nodes on battery power, drastically reducing the maintenance costs required to replace batteries. In this article, we review the state-of-the-art in energy-harvesting WSNs for environmental monitoring applications, including Animal Tracking, Air Quality Monitoring, Water Quality Monitoring, and Disaster Monitoring to improve the ecosystem and human life. In addition to presenting the technologies for harvesting energy from ambient sources and the protocols that can take advantage of the harvested energy, we present challenges that must be addressed to further advance energy-harvesting-based WSNs, along with some future work directions to address these challenges.

Similar to graphene and other 2D materials, the physical and chemical properties of MoS2 can be tuned by the chemical functionalization and defects. In this investigation, our objective is to explore the mechanical properties of single-layer MoS2 functionalized by the hydrogen atoms. We moreover analyze the effects of different types of defects on the mechanical response of MoS2 at the room temperature. To investigate these systems, we conducted reactive molecular dynamics simulations using the ReaxFF forcefield. We demonstrate that an increase in the hydrogen adatoms or defects contents significantly affects the critical mechanical characteristics of MoS2; elastic modulus, tensile strength, stretchability and failure behavior. Our reactive molecular dynamics results provide useful information concerning the mechanical response of hydrogenated and defective MoS2 and the design of nanodevices. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A Video Surveillance System to Monitor Breeding Colonies of Common Terns (Sterna Hirundo)	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS			English	Article						Environmental Sciences; Issue 137; Surveillance; video monitoring; ground-nesting; waterbird; breeding; behavior; common tern; Sterna hirundo	REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; HUMAN DISTURBANCE; CHESAPEAKE BAY; RESTORATION; POPULATION; SURVIVAL; SEABIRDS; NESTS	Many waterbird populations have faced declines over the last century, including the common tern (Sterna hirundo), a waterbird species with a widespread breeding distribution, that has been recently listed as endangered in some habitats of its range. Waterbird monitoring programs exist to track populations through time; however, some of the more intensive approaches require entering colonies and can be disruptive to nesting populations. This paper describes a protocol that utilizes a minimally invasive surveillance system to continuously monitor common tern nesting behavior in typical ground-nesting colonies. The video monitoring system utilizes wireless cameras focused on individual nests as well as over the colony as a whole, and allows for observation without entering the colony. The video system is powered with several 12 V car batteries that are continuously recharged using solar panels. Footage is recorded using a digital video recorder (DVR) connected to a hard drive, which can be replaced when full. The DVR may be placed outside of the colony to reduce disturbance. In this study, 3,624 h of footage recorded over 63 days in weather conditions ranging from 12.8 degrees C to 35.0 degrees C produced 3,006 h (83%) of usable behavioral data. The types of data retrieved from the recorded video can vary; we used it to detect external disturbances and measure nesting behavior during incubation. Although the protocol detailed here was designed for ground-nesting waterbirds, the principal system could easily be modified to accommodate alternative scenarios, such as colonial arboreal nesting species, making it widely applicable to a variety of research needs.

Low-bandgap CQDs can convert invisible NIR light sources to electrical energy more efficiently than wider spectra because of reduced thermalization loss. This energy-conversion strategy via NIR photons ensures an enhanced photostability of the CQD devices. Furthermore, the NIR wireless charging system can be concealed using various colored and NIR-transparent fabric or films, providing aesthetic freedom. Finally, an NIR-driven wireless charging system is demonstrated for a wearable healthcare bracelet by integrating a CQD PVs receiver with a flexible lithium-ion battery and entirely embedding them into a flexible strap, enabling permanent self-charging without detachment.

Like aqueous Li-ion batteries, aqueous sodium-ion batteries (ASIBs) are also demonstrated to be one of the most promising stationary power sources for sustainable energies such as wind and solar power. Compared to traditional nonaqueous batteries, ASIBs may solve the safety problems associated with the highly toxic and flammable organic electrolyte in the traditional lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries. During the past decades, many efforts are made to improve the performance of the ASIBs. The present review focuses on the latest advances in the exploration and development of ASIB systems and related components, including cathodes, anodes, and electrolytes. Previously reported studies are briefly summarized, together with the presentation of new findings based on the electrochemical performance, cycling stability, and morphology approaches. In addition, the main opportunities, achievements, and challenges in this field are briefly commented and discussed.

Demonstration of a low cost, high temperature elemental sulfur thermal battery	APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Sulfur; SulfurTES battery; Thermal Energy Storage (TES); Volumetric energy density; Hybrid energy storage	PHASE-CHANGE MATERIALS; ENERGY-STORAGE; GRAPHITE FOAM; BEHAVIOR	Elemental sulfur is a low-cost energy storage media suitable for many medium to high temperature applications, including trough and tower concentrated solar power (CSP) and combined heat and power (CHP) systems. In this study, we have demonstrated the viability of an elemental sulfur thermal energy storage (SulfurTES) system using a laboratory-scale thermal battery. The SulfurTES battery design uses a shell-and-tube thermal battery configuration, wherein stationary elemental sulfur is isochorically stored in multiple stainless steel tubes and a heat transfer fluid (air) is passed over them through the surrounding shell. The safe and reliable operation was demonstrated for twelve thermal charge-discharge cycles in the temperature range of 200-600 degrees C, during which the SulfurTES battery stored up to 7.6 kW h of thermal energy with volumetric energy density range up to 255 kW h/m(3). Furthermore, the SulfurTES battery is operated in a hybrid thermal charging mode to demonstrate its ability to store surplus electrical energy. The present study establishes the feasibility of SulfurTES as a concept that could provide attractive system cost and volumetric energy density for a wide range of thermal energy storage applications.

It has sparked a surge of research activities in material science since its first preparation by mechanical exfoliation in 2014. Several reviews have focused on the structure and anisotropic properties of phosphorene as well as its applications in transistors, batteries, and solar cells. Compared to graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD5), phosphorene possesses higher surface to volume ratio due to its "puckered" lattice structure and has presented some unique advantages in sensing applications. This review aims to summarize recent developments in the sensing applications of phosphorene, including gas sensing, humidity sensing, photo-detection, bio-sensing and ion sensing. The article concludes with the current challenges and future prospects for the production and sensing applications of phosphorene. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Basic features of monitoring and regulating the generation, and demand-side of the grid are discussed along with feedback-based measures for effective performance monitoring in the microgrid. Finally, the paper also points out a unique cloud infrastructure that can be used to store data, perform data analysis and assist in decision making in case of extreme situations.

There are three operation modes of the system: solar-balancing, storage-balancing, and charge balancing. The solar-balancing mode charges the battery module with the lowest state of charge (SOC) using the solar power during vehicle driving; the charge-balancing mode is operated when the vehicle is parked and being charged by the conventional charger. Under this mode, the balancing circuit discharges the battery module with the highest SOC by transferring the energy to an additional storage cell while the solar panel also charges the storage cell independently at the same time if solar power is available. When the solar power is low, the storage-balancing mode will be selected to charge the battery module with the lowest SOC using energy stored in the storage cell. This system eliminates the energy loss that would otherwise happen in conventional active and passive balancing schemes by equalizing the battery using solar/stored energy in the storage cell. A 48-V battery pack with four 12-V battery modules system is simulated and tested. A prototype system is developed to prove the concept. The simulation and experimental results verify that the proposed system not only achieves the same balancing performance as conventional balancing circuits, but also effectively increases the overall usable battery energy by 2.1%-3.3% every 13.2 km.

Bringing recent technological innovations in automation, robotics and computer science together with current approaches in chemistry, materials synthesis and characterization will act as a catalyst for revolutionizing traditional research and development in both industry and academia. This Perspective provides a vision for an integrated artificial intelligence approach towards autonomous materials discovery, which, in our opinion, will emerge within the next 5 to 10 years. The approach we discuss requires the integration of the following tools, which have already seen substantial development to date: high-throughput virtual screening, automated synthesis planning, automated laboratories and machine learning algorithms. In addition to reducing the time to deployment of new materials by an order of magnitude, this integrated approach is expected to lower the cost associated with the initial discovery. Thus, the price of the final products (for example, solar panels, batteries and electric vehicles) will also decrease. This in turn will enable industries and governments to meet more ambitious targets in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions at a faster pace.

Advanced Materials and Devices for Bioresorbable Electronics	ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH			English	Review							RESISTIVE SWITCHING MEMORY; FIELD-EFFECT TRANSISTORS; TRANSIENT ELECTRONICS; SILICON NANOMEMBRANES; DISSOLUTION CHEMISTRY; WATER; BIOCOMPATIBILITY; NANOPARTICLES; MECHANISMS; BATTERIES	CONSPECTUS: Recent advances in materials chemistry establish the foundations for unusual classes of electronic systems, characterized by their ability to fully or partially dissolve, disintegrate, or otherwise physically or chemically decompose in a controlled fashion after some defined period of stable operation. Such types of "transient" technologies may enable consumer gadgets associated with disposal, implantable sensors that disappear harmlessly in the body, and hardware-secure platforms that prevent unwanted recovery of sensitive data. This second area of opportunity, sometimes referred to as bioresorbable electronics, is of particular interest due to its ability to provide diagnostic or therapeutic function in a manner that can enhance or monitor transient biological processes, such as wound healing, while bypassing risks associated with extended device load on the body or with secondary surgical procedures for removal. Early chemistry research established sets of bioresorbable materials for substrates, encapsulation layers, and dielectrics, along with several options in organic and bio-organic semiconductors. The subsequent realization that nanoscale forms of device-grade monocrystalline silicon, such as silicon nanomembranes (m-Si NMs, or Si NMs) undergo hydrolysis in biofluids to yield biocompatible byproducts over biologically relevant time scales advanced the field by providing immediate routes to high performance operation and versatile, sophisticated levels of function. When combined with bioresorbable conductors, dielectrics, substrates, and encapsulation layers, Si NMs provide the basis for a broad, general class of bioresorbable electronics. Other properties of Si, such as its piezoresistivity and photovoltaic properties, allow other types of bioresorbable devices such as solar cells, strain gauges, pH sensors, and photodetectors. The most advanced bioresorbable devices now exist as complete systems with successful demonstrations of clinically relevant modes of operation in animal models. This Account highlights the foundational materials concepts for this area of technology, starting with the dissolution chemistry and reaction kinetics associated with hydrolysis of Si NMs as a function of temperature, pH, and ion and protein concentration. A following discussion focuses on key supporting materials, including a range of dielectrics, metals, and substrates. As comparatively low performance alternatives to Si NMs, bioresorbable organic semiconductors are also presented, where interest derives from their intrinsic flexibility, low-temperature processability, and ease of chemical modification. Representative examples of encapsulation materials and strategies in passive and active control of device lifetime are then discussed, with various device illustrations. A final section outlines bioresorbable electronics for sensing of various biophysical parameters, monitoring electrophysiological activity, and delivering drugs in a programmed manner. Fundamental research in chemistry remains essential to the development of this emerging field, where continued advances will increase the range of possibilities in sensing, actuation, and power harvesting. Materials for encapsulation layers that can delay water-diffusion and dissolution of active electronics in passively or actively triggered modes are particularly important in addressing areas of opportunity in clinical medicine, and in secure systems for envisioned military and industrial uses. The deep scientific content and the broad range of application opportunities suggest that research in transient electronic materials will remain a growing area of interest to the chemistry community.

An intertemporal decision framework for electrochemical energy storage management	NATURE ENERGY			English	Article							LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES; FREQUENCY REGULATION; CAPACITY FADE; SOLAR-ENERGY; CYCLE LIFE; DEGRADATION; COST; OPTIMIZATION; INTEGRATION; CALENDAR	Dispatchable energy storage is necessary to enable renewable-based power systems that have zero or very low carbon emissions. The inherent degradation behaviour of electrochemical energy storage (EES) is a major concern for both EES operational decisions and EES economic assessments. Here, we propose a decision framework that addresses the intertemporal tradeoffs in terms of EES degradation by deriving, implementing and optimizing two metrics: the marginal benefit of usage and the average benefit of usage. These metrics are independent of the capital cost of the EES system, and, as such, separate the value of EES use from the initial cost, which provides a different perspective on storage valuation and operation. Our framework is proved to produce the optimal solution for EES life-cycle profit maximization. We show that the proposed framework offers effective ways to assess the economic values of EES, to make investment decisions for various applications and to inform related subsidy policies.

The main challenge of employing PV systems is the intermittent nature of solar energy. The irradiance variations are mainly caused by cloud motion and the associated shadows moving over solar arrays. Thus, when dealing with high PV penetration levels, simulation of cloud shadow motion and its effect on the power system is of interest. In thiswork, a cloud motion simulator (CMS) that incorporates quasi-steady-state power-flow analysis is introduced. Moreover, how the CMS parameters can be estimated from field data is discussed. Cloud motion and the consequent voltage fluctuations can cause voltage flicker issues. A new and practical method for calculating short-term flicker severity based on the IEEE 1453-2015 standard is introduced and discussed. Effects of cloud speed, number of clouds, width of clouds, and time interval between clouds on short-term flicker are investigated. In addition, the effect of using distributed models for larger PV systems on flicker severity is investigated.

It consists of a statistical approach to introduce sub-hourly events in the hourly economic accounting process. The methodology is implemented in the distributed energy resources customer adoption model (DER-CAM), a state of the art mixed integer linear model used to optimally size DER in decentralized energy systems.

Here we demonstrate, for the first time, the synergistic effect between multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and FeSe2 in a form of MWCNT/FeSe2 composite, for the heterogeneous electron transfer (HET) reaction with the [Ru(NH3)(6)](3+/2+) redox probe and the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic media. Plain FeSe2 and the MWCNT/FeSe2 composite were synthesized using a one-pot hydrothermal method. Although all electrode materials (pristine MWCNT, FeSe2, and MWCNT/FeSe2) show a quasi-reversible electrode behavior, MWCNT/FeSe2 has a smaller peak separation potential and exhibits an enhanced HET rate constant, k(0) = 5.4 x 10(-3) cm/s, which is 3.2 and 1.6 times higher than that of FeSe2 and MWCNT, respectively. Similarly, the HER performance of the composite demonstrates a smaller Tafel slope of 70 mV/dec and a reduced overpotential. We anticipate that such promising outcome can be further improved by employing different morphologies of FeSe2 and engineered interaction with other conductive supports suitable for their applications in electrochemical sensing and energy conversion.

In the last couple of years, many studies for EES capacity planning have been produced. However, these resulted in a very broad range of power and energy capacity requirements for storage, making it difficult for policymakers to identify clear storage planning recommendations. Therefore, we studied 17 recent storage expansion studies pertinent to the U.S., Europe, and Germany. We then systemized the storage requirement per variable renewable energy (VRE) share and generation technology. Our synthesis reveals that with increasing VRE shares, the EES power capacity increases linearly; and the energy capacity, exponentially. Further, by analyzing the outliers, the EES energy requirements can be at least halved. It becomes clear that grids dominated by photovoltaic energy call for more EES, while large shares of wind rely more on transmission capacity. Taking into account the energy mix clarifies to a large degree the apparent conflict of the storage requirements between the existing studies. Finally, there might exist a negative bias towards storage because transmission costs are frequently optimistic (by neglecting execution delays and social opposition) and storage can cope with uncertainties, but these issues are rarely acknowledged in the planning process.

The objective function of the model is to minimize the total cost associated with solar power system investments and the grid provided electric power over a planning horizon. We consider the uncertainty associated with solar radiation, load, and electricity price in the form of probabilistic scenarios. The model can be used with different grid pricing programs and under no net metering or net metering programs, respectively. A numerical example and its parametric analyses are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the model and develop some insights into optimal sizing of a battery storage enabled solar system. The analyses show the size of the solar system is influenced by the labor cost and the load size whereas the size of the battery storage is sensitive to the load size and the battery cost. Moreover, we find the optimal number of solar panels/batteries is larger under the net metering program than under no net metering program.

Rechargeable batteries in self-sustainable systems suffer from adverse environmental impact, low thermal stability, and fast aging. Advancements in supercapacitor energy density and low-power processors have reached an inflection point, where a data-intensive (e.g., operating on high-frame-rate visual data) field-deployed system can rely solely on supercapacitors for energy buffering. This paper demonstrates the first working prototype of such a system, consisting of eight 3000-Farad supercapacitors, a 70-mW controller/harvester board, and a Nexus tablet. We address the challenges of maintaining quality-of-service (QoS) on a limited energy buffer. We leverage the voltage-to-stored-energy relationship in capacitors to enable precise energy buffer modeling (no more than 3% error in time-to-depletion prediction). To achieve high precision, we find that it is necessary to account for the variation of effective capacitance, particularly lower capacitance at lower voltages nearing energy depletion. Modern mobile processors operate most efficiently at very high load (when most cycles are effectively utilized) or very low load (when fewer cores are active at a lower frequency). We propose delayed bursts-continuous low-power data capture and bursts of data processing at a higher CPU configuration-to improve the power proportionality and realize high QoS at varying energy budget. Our working prototype has been successfully deployed at a campus building rooftop where it analyzes nearby traffic patterns continuously.

Supercapacitors, batteries and solar cells serve as eco-friendly energy storage and conversion systems vitally important for the sustainable development of human society. However, many diverse elements influence the performance of energy storage and conversion systems. The overall efficiency of systems depends on the specific structure and properties of incorporated functional materials. Carbon materials, such as graphene, are especially promising for materials development in the energy storage and conversion fields. Graphene, a two-dimensional (2D) carbon material only a single atom thick, has massless Dirac fermions (electron transport is governed by Dirac's equation), displays outstanding electrical conductivity, superior thermal conductivity and excellent mechanical properties. 2D free-standing graphene films and powders have paved the way for promising energy applications. Recently, much effort has been spent trying to improve the number of active sites in electrode materials within 3D network/aerogel structures derived from graphene. This is because graphene aerogels are promising materials for energy systems due to their porous hierarchical structure which affords rapid electron/ion transport, superior chemical and physical stability, and good cycle performance. This review aims to summarize the synthetic methods, mechanistic aspects, and energy storage and conversion applications of novel 3D network graphene, graphene derivatives and graphene-based materials. Areas of application include supercapacitors, Li-batteries, H-2 and thermal energy storage, fuel cells and solar cells.

This study presents an analysis of the lateral thickness of a coated layer that consists of a fluid with a high viscosity produced by using a slot-die roll-to-roll system with specific attention focused on a pinned edge phenomenon exhibited in the coated layer. A solution viscosity of 832 mPa.s is used and includes relatively high capillary numbers in the experiment in the range of 0.47-3.47. The purpose of the study included analyzing various forces around the coating nozzle and determining the correlation between forces by using dimensionless numbers. Computational fluid dynamics analysis and experiments were performed to obtain various parameters in terms of these dimensionless numbers. The experimental results suggest that the pinned edge should be reduced below 10% by reducing the coating gap parameter that represents the gravity forces.

The pressing demand of developing high-performance electrochemical energy storage solutions, i.e., batteries, relies on both fundamental understanding and practical developments from both the academy and industry. The formidable challenge of developing successful battery technology stems from the different requirements for different energy-storage applications. Energy density, power, stability, safety, and cost parameters all have to be balanced in batteries to meet the requirements of different applications. Therefore, multiple battery technologies based on different materials and mechanisms need to be developed and optimized. Incisive tools that could directly probe the chemical reactions in various battery materials are becoming critical to advance the field beyond its conventional trial-and-error approach. Here, we present detailed protocols for soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS), soft X-ray emission spectroscopy (sXES), and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) experiments, which are inherently elemental-sensitive probes of the transition-metal 3d and anion 2p states in battery compounds. We provide the details on the experimental techniques and demonstrations revealing the key chemical states in battery materials through these soft X-ray spectroscopy techniques.

The amount of Au NPs in the Au@TiO2 nanofibers was varied by the concentration of HAuCl4 center dot 3H(2)O in the electrospinning solution. The formation of the Au@TiO2 nanofibers during the pyrolysis process was characterized by SEM, TEM, TGA, and UV/Vis. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on composite photoanode of the Au@TiO2 nanofibers and the TiO2 nanoparticles were investigated.

Owing to their earth abundance, low-cost, structural tunability, large-surface area, and unique physicochemical properties, graphitic carbon materials have attracted a great deal of attention for energy-related applications. However, the pristine graphene materials without functionalization is intractable (insoluble and infusible), which has hindered their practical applications. Therefore, considerable research effort has been devoted to the development of functionalized graphene materials with desirable properties for specific applications, including energy conversion and storage. It was demonstrated that functionalized graphene materials with tunable work functions were useful as charge-extraction materials to effectively improve solar cell performance while those with high electrocatalytic activities could be used as metal-free catalysts in fuel cells, metal-air batteries, water splitting and integrated energy systems. This article provides a timely focused review on the development of heteroatom-doped graphene materials for low-cost, but efficient, energy generation and storage.

Four conventional parts (liquid/gas diffusion layer, bipolar plate, gasket, and current distributor) in a PEMEC were integrated into one multifunctional AM plate without committing to tools or molds for the first time. In addition, since the interfacial contact resistances between those parts were eliminated, the comprehensive in-situ characterizations of AM cells showed that an excellent energy efficiency of up to 86.48% was achieved at 2 A/cm(2) and 80 degrees C, and the hydrogen generation rate was increased by 61.81% compared to the conventional cell. More importantly, the highly complex inner structures of the AM integrated multifunctional plates also exhibit the potential to break limitations of conventional manufacture methods for hydrogen generation and to open a door for the development of other energy conversion devices, including fuel cells, solar cells and batteries.

J	Barbour, E; Gonzalez, MC				Barbour, Edward; Gonzalez, Marta C.			Projecting battery adoption in the prosumer era	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Energy storage; Residential batteries; Rooftop PV; Battery economics; Prosumer self-sufficiency	PHOTOVOLTAIC SELF-CONSUMPTION; ENERGY-STORAGE; PROFITABILITY ANALYSIS; RESIDENTIAL SOLAR; PV; SYSTEMS; TECHNOLOGIES; SIMULATION; OPERATION; BENEFITS	Solar photovoltaic (PV) has the potential to make an important contribution to global sustainability, however, the misalignment between solar production and residential demand presents challenges for widespread PV adoption. Combining PV and storage is one way that this challenge can be overcome. In this work, we use one year of smart meter data from 369 consumers in three different US regions and calculate their economic benefits from both PV and coupled PV-battery systems. We consider a range of different electricity pricing schemes from the consumer regions, including both Feed-In-Tariff (FIT) and Net-Energy-Metering (NEM) policies. Significantly, our work uses real demand data, real PV generation data and optimizes each individual consumer's battery operation to minimize their electricity bill. Furthermore, we study the effect of batteries on consumer self-sufficiency, which is important because increasing self-sufficiency is a primary motivating factor behind battery adoption. We find that PV is profitable for the majority of consumers with most current pricing scenarios but PV-battery systems are always less profitable. However, batteries can provide very significant increases in self-sufficiency and we find that a majority of consumers can exceed 70% self-sufficiency with a 20 kW h battery and a PV system that produces the equivalent of their consumption. This is compared to an average self-sufficiency of 35% with PV only. Finally, recognizing that a number of factors could lead to profitable batteries in future, we study the sensitivity of battery profitability to future electricity prices in a FIT scenario, also accounting for future decreases in PV and battery costs. We find that if PV-battery systems are to become better investments than PV-only for the majority of consumers, retail electricity prices above $0.40/kW h and FIT rates below $0.05/kW h are a likely requirement.

J	Nazaripouya, H; Chu, CC; Pota, HR; Gadh, R				Nazaripouya, Hamidreza; Chu, Chi-Cheng; Pota, Hemanshu Roy; Gadh, Rajit			Battery Energy Storage System Control for Intermittency Smoothing Using an Optimized Two-Stage Filter	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SUSTAINABLE ENERGY			English	Article						Solar power smoothing; battery energy storage system; FIR filter; minimum-phase; convex optimization	RAMP-RATE CONTROL; POWER-GENERATION; PV; FLUCTUATIONS; INTEGRATION; DESIGN; PLANTS	A new method for the control of a battery energy storage system and its implementation on a 25 kW solar system to compensate solar power intermittency and improve distribution grid power quality is presented in this paper. The novelty of the proposed method is to provide a systematic way to optimize the size of the battery capacity for the desired level of solar power smoothing. This goal is achieved by designing a two-stage filter solution. The first stage is a fast response digital finite impulse response (FIR) filter that makes a trade-off between smoothing of the solar output and battery capacity. This paper proposes an optimal design of a minimum-length, low-group-delay FIR filter by employing convex optimization, discrete signal processing, and polynomial stabilization techniques. The new strategy proposed in this paper formulates the design of a length-N low-group-delay FIR filter as a convex second-order cone programming, which guarantees that all the filter zeros are inside the unit circle (minimum-phase). A quasi-convex optimization problem is formulated to minimize the length of the low-group-delay FIR filter. The second-stage filter is designed to level the battery charging load. The effectiveness and performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated by simulation results and also over a real-case implementation.

J	Baulch, B; Do, TD; Le, TH				Baulch, Bob; Thuy Duong Do; Thai-Ha Le			Constraints to the uptake of solar home systems in Ho Chi Minh City and some proposals for improvement	RENEWABLE ENERGY			English	Article						Solar home systems; Vietnam; Electricity; Payback period		This study examines the constraints to the uptake of Solar Home Systems (SHS) in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam. SHS are photovoltaic systems which generate electricity for residential properties. The limited numbers of SHS installed in HCMC are mostly on-grid systems with backup batteries to supply electricity to residential properties during evenings and/or power cuts. Semi-structured interviews with SHS installers, manufacturers and users, plus government agencies and technical experts identify pricing, regulatory issues and the cost of systems as major constraints. Cost-benefit analysis is then used to estimate the financial rates of return and payback periods for three representative SHS. Introducing net metering with a price equal to the proposed tariff of VND 3250/kWh would generate financial rates of return of over 7.5% and shorten the payback periods for the two larger systems from more than 30 years to 12 or 13 years. Smaller off-grid kits are already competitive with small, stand-alone diesel or gasoline generators. In the next five years, reforms to Vietnam's electricity market can be expected to green the energy mix and make SHS more finally attractive. SHS therefore represent a promising technology for HCMC in the future. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Optimal dispatch and equipment sizing of a residential central utility plant for improving rooftop solar integration	ENERGY			English	Article						Central utility plant; Mixed integer linear program; Capacity and dispatch optimization; Distributed energy systems; Residential electric-grid interactions	POWER; ENERGY; SYSTEMS; MICROTURBINE; MICROGRIDS; MANAGEMENT; OPERATION; STORAGE; MODEL	This study develops a mixed-integer linear program for modeling the optimal equipment capacity and dispatch of a central utility plant (CUP) in a residential neighborhood and its ability to improve rooftop solar integration. The CUP equipment includes a microturbine, battery, chiller plant, and cooling storage. The CUP model is exposed to a variety of electricity rate structures to see how they influence its operation. The model finds the optimal capacity for each piece of CUP equipment, optimizing their hourly dispatch to meet neighborhood cooling and electric demand while maximizing profit. In an Austin, TX, USA base case, the neighborhood benefits economically by including the CUP, although the CUP demonstrates limited potential to integrate high penetrations of rooftop solar resources. While peak demand and reverse power flows are reduced under all tested rate structures, the CUP worsens net demand ramp rates. A time-of-use rate with no demand charge and moderate differences between off-peak and on peak prices balances the output parameters, reducing reverse power flows by 43%, peak demand by 51%, and annual cost by 9.1% versus the "No CUP" base case while limiting net demand ramp rate increase to 84% more than the base case.

This article describes how two different commercial Li-ion batteries based on LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 (NCA) and LiFePO4 (LFP) chemistries were tested under grid duty cycles recently developed for two specific grid services: (1) frequency regulation (FR) and (2) peak shaving (PS) with and without being subjected to electric vehicle (EV) drive cycles. The lifecycle comparison derived from the capacity, round-trip efficiency (RTE), resistance, charge/discharge energy, and total used energy of the two battery chemistries are discussed. The LFP chemistry shows better stability for the energy intensive PS service, while the NCA chemistry is more conducive to the FR service under the operating regimes investigated. The results can be used as a guideline for selection, deployment, operation, and cost analyses of Li-ion batteries used for different applications.

Charge and discharge behavior of elemental sulfur in isochoric high temperature thermal energy storage systems	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Sulfur; Thermal energy storage (TES); Thermal charge and discharge rate; Natural convection; Nusselt and Rayleigh number; Concentrating solar power (CSP)	TURBULENT NATURAL-CONVECTION; FLOW	Thermal energy storage with elemental sulfur is a low-cost alternative to molten salts for many medium to high temperature energy applications (200-600 degrees C). In this effort, by examining elemental sulfur stored isochorically inside isolated pipes, we find that sulfur provides attractive charge/discharge performance since it operates in the liquid-vapor regime at the temperatures relevant to many important applications, such as combined heat and power (CHP) plants and concentrating solar power (CSP) plants with advanced power cycle systems. The isolated pipe configuration is relevant to shell-and-tube thermal battery applications where the heat transfer fluid flows over the storage pipes through the shell. We analyze the transient charge and discharge behavior of sulfur inside the pipes using detailed computational modeling of the complex conjugate heat transfer and fluid flow phenomena. The computational model is validated against experiments of a single tube with well-defined temperature boundary conditions and internal temperature measurements. The model results evaluate the influence of pipe diameter on charge and discharge times, heat transfer rate, and Nusselt number due to buoyancy driven convection currents. Depending on the Rayleigh number (pipe diameter), the average Nusselt number obtained for discharge is 3-14 times higher than proposed solid-liquid phase change technologies based on molten salt, which are limited in their performance due to conduction based solidification and low thermal conductivity. The results show competing trade-offs between increase in heat transfer coefficient, thermal energy stored in sulfur, and increase in charge and discharge time with increase in pipe diameter. A preferred pipe diameter can be determined for target applications based on their requirements and these competing trade-offs. A validated fundamental correlation for Nusselt number as a function of Rayleigh number for charge and discharge is developed that can be used to design the sulfur-based thermal storage system for transient operation.

One of the advantages of 2D layered nanostructures is their attractive physical, chemical and mechanical properties that could be designed and tuned by manipulating their composition and thickness at the atomic or molecular level during the synthesis process. This review firstly introduces several versatile chemical approaches for the bottom-up fabrication of 2D layered organic-inorganic hybrid materials. A few types of nanolayered organic-inorganic materials and their tunable properties are then presented and discussed from the view of having high-performance characteristics. The chemical attributes that would enhance the properties of nanolayered organic-inorganic materials are also assessed. This article then focuses on the applications of nanolayered organic-inorganic hybrid materials in clean energy research such as batteries, supercapacitors, water splitting, perovskite solar cells and thermoelectric devices. The final section discusses current challenges and future directions of nanolayered organic-inorganic hybrid materials.

The single-layer textile MFC uses Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1) as a biocatalyst to produce a maximum power of 6.4 mu W cm(-2) and current density of 52 mu A cm(-2), which are substantially higher than previous textile-MFCs and are similar to other flexible paper-based MFCs. The textile MFC demonstrates a stable performance with repeated stretching and twisting cycles. The membrane-less single-chamber configuration drastically simplifies the fabrication and improves the performance of the MFC. A conductive and hydrophilic anode in a 3D fabric microchamber maximizes bacterial electricity generation from a liquid environment and a silver oxide/silver solid-state cathode reduces cathodic overpotential for fast catalytic reaction. A simple batch fabrication approach simultaneously constructs 35 individual devices, which will revolutionize the mass production of textile MFCs. This stretchable and twistable power device printed directly onto a single textile substrate can establish a standardized platform for textile-based biobatteries and will be potentially integrated into wearable electronics in the future.

J	Alstone, P; Jacobson, A				Alstone, Peter; Jacobson, Arne			LED advances accelerate universal access to electric lighting	COMPTES RENDUS PHYSIQUE			English	Article						Light emitting diodes; Solid state lighting; Energy efficiency; Developing world; Solar lighting	KEROSENE; SYSTEMS	A rapid increase in the performance and quality of white LED light sources has changed the dynamics of electricity access in the last 10 years, reaching tens of millions of people with electric light who previously had no viable alternatives to fuel-based lighting, which is dangerous and expensive. Eliminating fuel-based lighting is a key public health, safety, social equality, and environmental opportunity that is now achievable. Technology advances in LEDs, other super-efficient appliances, solar photovoltaic generation, advanced batteries, and coordinating information technology systems have combined to significantly expand the reach of off-grid energy systems. With support and effort, it is plausible that small "pico-solar" and "solar home" systems could serve over a billion people within a generation, providing basic but highly valued services. Continued progress can be achieved with attention to continued improvements in technology, supporting a growing range of new businesses and enterprises in energy access markets, and synergy with broader human development effort around access to clean water, financial inclusion, and fair access to resources.

In view of the enhanced and/or diversified function of integrated devices, as compared with conventional devices with limited performance or sole applicability, many integrated power packs have been widely developed by combining different devices, such as a silicon solar cell (SSC), Cu(In,Ga)(Sn,Se)(2) (CIGS), organic solar cell (OSC), dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), perovskite solar cell (PSC), lithium-ion battery (LIB), nanogenerator (NG), supercapacitor (SC), photoelectrosynthetic cell (PESC), and electrolysis cell (ELC), into one unit. In this Review, with a particular emphasis on their recent advances, we cover the integrated solar cell device research in a broad sense and provide an overview of state-of-the-art progress on the integrated solar cell devices based on DSSC and PSC, such as DSSC/LIB, DSSC/SC, DSSC/NG, DSSC/LIB/NG, PSC/OSC, PSC/CIGS, PSC/PSC, PSC/SSC, SSC/SC, PSC/SC, OSC/SC, DSSC/PESC, PSC/PESC, and PSC/ELC, for energy harvesting and storage that are significantly important for self-powering systems and portable/wearable electronics.

An integrated electrochemical device based on earth-abundant metals for both energy storage and conversion	ENERGY STORAGE MATERIALS			English	Article						Layered double hydroxide (LDH); Supercapacitor; Water splitting; Integrated electrochemical device; Morphology-tunable nanostructure	LAYERED DOUBLE HYDROXIDES; OXYGEN-EVOLUTION ELECTROCATALYSTS; GRAPHENE-BASED MATERIALS; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; WATER OXIDATION; ASYMMETRIC SUPERCAPACITORS; ELECTRODE MATERIALS; FLEXIBLE SUPERCAPACITORS; THIN-FILMS; NI FOAM	With rising energy consumption in the world and the negative environmental and human health impacts of fossil fuels, the demand for renewable energy sources is increasing. The energy generated by renewable energy sources can be stored either in a chemical (water splitting) or an electrochemical (battery or supercapacitor) form, that are two distinct processes. Here, we introduce an integrated solar-powered system for both electrochemical energy storage and water electrolysis. A nickel-cobalt-iron layered double hydroxide (Ni-Co-Fe LDH) was successfully synthesized on nickel foam as a substrate using a fast, one-step electrodeposition approach. The Ni-Co-Fe LDH exhibited excellent electrochemical properties both as an active electrode material in supercapacitors, and as a catalyst in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). When employed as the positive electrode in a supercapacitor, along with activated carbon as the negative electrode in an asymmetric configuration, the ultrathin and porous Ni-Co-Fe LDH nanoplatelets delivered an ultrahigh specific energy of 57.5 W h kg(-1) with an outstanding specific power of 37.9 kW kg(-1) and an excellent cycle life. As an OER electrocatalyst, Ni-Co-Fe LDH exhibited superior electrocatalytic performances with a very low overpotential of 0.207 V versus a reference hydrogen electrode (RHE) at 10.0 mA cm(-2), and a small Tafel slope of 31 mV dec(-1). The superior energy storage and catalytic OER properties of the Ni-Co-Fe LDH nanoplatelet array can be attributed to both the synergistic effects among the metal species and the unique mesoporous structure of the LDH that provides facilitated charge/ion diffusion pathways and more available active sites.

J	Wang, C; Li, J; Yang, YY; Ye, F				Wang, Cong; Li, Ji; Yang, Yuanyuan; Ye, Fan			Combining Solar Energy Harvesting with Wireless Charging for Hybrid Wireless Sensor Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING			English	Article						Wireless sensor networks; solar energy harvesting; wireless charging; mobile data gathering; facility location problem; partial recharge	FACILITY LOCATION; APPROXIMATION ALGORITHMS; DATA-COLLECTION; FRAMEWORK; LIFETIME	The application of wireless charging technology in traditional battery-powered wireless sensor networks (WSNs) grows rapidly recently. Although previous studies indicate that the technology can deliver energy reliably, it still faces regulatory mandate to provide high power density without incurring health risks. In particular, in clustered WSNs there exists a mismatch between the high energy demands from cluster heads and the relatively low energy supplies from wireless chargers. Fortunately, solar energy harvesting can provide high power density without health risks. However, its reliability is subject to weather dynamics. In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework that combines the two technologies-cluster heads are equipped with solar panels to scavenge solar energy and the rest of nodes are powered by wireless charging. We divide the network into three hierarchical levels. On the first level, we study a discrete placement problem of how to deploy solar-powered cluster heads that can minimize overall cost and propose a distributed 1.61(1+ is an element of)(2)1-approximation algorithm for the placement. Then, we extend the discrete problem into continuous space and develop an iterative algorithm based on the Weiszfeld algorithm. On the second level, we establish an energy balance in the network and explore how to maintain such balance for wireless-powered nodes when sunlight is unavailable. We also propose a distributed cluster head re-selection algorithm. On the third level, we first consider the tour planning problem by combining wireless charging with mobile data gathering in a joint tour. We then propose a polynomial-time scheduling algorithm to find appropriate hitting points on sensors' transmission boundaries for data gathering. For wireless charging, we give the mobile chargers more flexibility by allowing partial recharge when energy demands are high. The problem turns out to be a Linear Program. By exploiting its particular structure, we propose an efficient algorithm that can achieve near-optimal solutions. Our extensive simulation results demonstrate that the hybrid framework can reduce battery depletion by 20 percent and save vehicles' moving cost by 25 percent compared to previous works. By allowing partial recharge, battery depletion can be further reduced at a slightly increased cost. The results also suggest that we can reduce the number of high-cost mobile chargers by deploying more low-cost solar-powered sensors.

The real-world driving cycles from a fleet of connected vehicles are evaluated in an EV model with different charging options. Daily utility services are added to the simulations to explore the whole day performance of the battery and its daily degradation. Fifty driving cycles from different drivers on arterial roads are classified into aggressive, mild, and gentle drivers based on their driving acceleration behavior. The standard levels 1 and 2 chargers are considered for recharging and the frequency regulation, and peak shaving and solar energy storage are assumed for the daily ancillary services. The results indicate that the aggressive driving and recharging behavior have significant effect on the battery life reduction. In addition, the daily utility services impose extra degradation of the battery. Also, the effect of temperature change on the battery degradation is explored. Simulation of active versus passive thermal management systems in three different climates shows the significant impact of the battery temperature on its capacity fade.

A New Black Carbon Sensor for Dense Air Quality Monitoring Networks	SENSORS			English	Article						air quality monitoring; black carbon; wireless sensor network	PERSONAL EXPOSURE; POLLUTION; AETHALOMETER; ABSORPTION; PERFORMANCE; CHILDREN	Low-cost air pollution sensors are emerging and increasingly being deployed in densely distributed wireless networks that provide more spatial resolution than is typical in traditional monitoring of ambient air quality. However, a low-cost option to measure black carbon (BC)-a major component of particulate matter pollution associated with adverse human health risks-is missing. This paper presents a new BC sensor designed to fill this gap, the Aerosol Black Carbon Detector (ABCD), which incorporates a compact weatherproof enclosure, solar-powered rechargeable battery, and cellular communication to enable long-term, remote operation. This paper also demonstrates a data processing methodology that reduces the ABCD's sensitivity to ambient temperature fluctuations, and therefore improves measurement performance in unconditioned operating environments (e.g., outdoors). A fleet of over 100 ABCDs was operated outdoors in collocation with a commercial BC instrument (Magee Scientific, Model AE33) housed inside a regulatory air quality monitoring station. The measurement performance of the 105 ABCDs is comparable to the AE33. The fleet-average precision and accuracy, expressed in terms of mean absolute percentage error, are 9.2 +/- 0.8% (relative to the fleet average data) and 24.6 +/- 0.9% (relative to the AE33 data), respectively (fleet-average +/- 90% confidence interval).

To fabricate thin c-Si FPVs, it is important to improve their light-absorption properties while maintaining the flexible characteristics. In this study, vertically aligned microwires (MWs) on a 50 m-thick thin c-Si substrate are designed for novel FPVs. Increasing the length of the MWs enhances the optical properties of the thin c-Si without affecting its flexibility. To maximize the efficiency of the thin c-Si FPVs with MWs, tapered MWs and a localized back-contact structure are devised. This device shows a maximum efficiency of 18.9%. In addition, the proposed thin c-Si FPV with MWs shows high stability without any change in efficiency, even with 1000 bending cycles with a bending radius of 12 mm. Thus, we successfully demonstrate battery-free flexible electronic devices integrated with our thin c-Si FPVs with MWs.

J	Abas, K; Obraczka, K; Miller, L				Abas, Kevin; Obraczka, Katia; Miller, Leland			Solar-powered, wireless smart camera network: An IoT solution for outdoor video monitoring	COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Wireless camera networks; IoT; Outdoor video monitoring; Solar harvesting; Energy efficiency	SURVEILLANCE	In this paper, we present SlugCam, a solar-powered, wireless smart camera network that can be used in a variety of outdoor applications including video surveillance of public spaces, habitat and environmental monitoring, wildfire prevention and detection, to name a few. SlugCam was designed such that it can be deployed and left unattended for extended periods without requiring regular maintenance, e.g., frequent battery replacement. The system is built with off-the-shelf components which not only keeps it modular and low cost, but also facilitates its prototyping, rapid duplication, and evolution. SlugCam's on-board processing capability allows computer vision software to run locally and autonomously. Energy efficiency in SlugCam is accomplished both in: (1) hardware by micro-managing low-power components; as well as in (2) software by having the system's operation duty cycles automatically adapt to the current state of the battery in order to balance the trade-off between application-level requirements and power awareness. For example, SlugCam's smart camera node changes its monitoring behavior based on how much battery charge remains. Additionally, using its computer vision software, the system only records and transmits information upon event detection which contributes both to the system's energy efficiency as well as its low network bandwidth requirements. SlugCam's networking functionality enables camera nodes to transfer video files, as well as collaborate on tasks such as visual processing, event detection, and object tracking. It allows node-to-node, as well as scoped- or full broadcast communication. For point-to-point communication, SlugCam uses on-demand power-aware multi-path routing to transfer video files efficiently. Another important contribution of SlugCam is to provide an open-source wireless camera network that can adapt to address the requirements of future outdoor video monitoring applications. SlugCam also includes a Web-based server where video data is stored as well as a Web-based user interface that allows end users to interact with the system, tag, query and retrieve video files, and manage SlugCam nodes remotely. In addition to a detailed description of SlugCam, this paper presents an extensive power characterization of the system's operation and showcases its deployment in a lab testbed and a real world scenario.

Many of the capabilities provided by larger satellites and spacecraft (>2000 kg) are now available through small satellite technologies. Ongoing improvements in attitude control, propulsion, advanced communications, and scientific instrumentation continue to enhance their benefits, even within such strict volume and mass constraints. With such advances in CubeSat technologies, the power and energy demands have also increased dramatically, necessitating the need for larger deployable solar arrays, lower power electronics, efficient energy storage systems, and even energy transfer/harvesting systems. In terms of energy storage, more advanced battery chemistries with higher energy densities and higher power capabilities over a wider operating temperature range are also a fundamental need. There already exist today numerous commercially available energy storage options suitable for CubeSat applications, although many missions rely on custom designs. Similar to standard satellite design, the selection of an appropriate energy storage system is driven by mission requirements related to power, energy, and lifetime. This paper will provide a general review of performance capabilities of state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery technologies, as well as other advanced energy storage systems for small satellite applications.

In addition to batteries, load control technologies can reshape customer load profiles to optimize PV system use. The combination of PV, energy storage, and load control provides an integrated approach to PV deployment, which we call "solar plus". The U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory's Renewable Energy Optimization (REopt) model is utilized to evaluate cost-optimal technology selection, sizing, and dispatch in residential buildings under a variety of rate structures and locations. The REopt model is extended to include a controllable or "smart" domestic hot water heater model and smart air conditioner model. We find that the solar plus approach improves end user economics across a variety of rate structures - especially those that are challenging for PV - including lower grid export rates, non-coincident time-of-use structures, and demand charges.

In these systems, the maximum energy must be extracted from the variable input voltage (PV panel), boosted by different gains, and stored in high-voltage battery packs. Furthermore, depending on the battery state of charge, the charger should operate in constant voltage, constant current, or constant power modes, all the way from complete discharge condition, up to the charged floating voltage phase (V-bat = 230-430 V-dc). This combination of the variable PV input voltage and different states of charge creates a significant regulation challenge for the converter. In this paper, a high-efficiency fourth-order L3C resonant converter is proposed with an extreme voltage regulation capability that can effectively extract the maximum power from the PV panels and respond to the battery states of charge at different voltage and current levels. The experimental results from a 350-W prototype prove the features of the proposed L3C resonant converter and demonstrate its ability to track the maximum input power while responding to the battery various states of charge.

The neat SiO2 nanofibrous nonwoven mat (denoted as SiO2-NF) and the SiO2 mat functionalized with gold nanoparticles (denoted as Au@ SiO2-NF) were readily prepared by electro-spinning of spin dope containing precursors. Subsequently, a patterned layer of TiO2 nanoparticles was impregnated and transferred into the SiO2 or Au@SiO2-NF nonwoven mats. The freestanding composite mats of TiO2 nanoparticles and electrospun SiO2-NF or Au@SiO2-NF (denoted as TiO2-NP/SiO2-NF or TiO2-NP/Au@SiO2-NF, respectively) were demonstrated for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and photocatalytic dye degradation. By controlling the amount of TiO2, composite mats with only partially filled TiO2 nanoparticles on one side were used as photoanode and spacer in DSSCs; the device had an efficiency of 5.31%. Incorporation of Au nanoparticles in the photoanode (TiO2-NP/Au@SiO2-NF) improved the device performance. The thermally durable and freestanding TiO2-NP/SiO2-NF or TiO2-NP/Au@ SiO2-NF was also used as readily recyclable and regeneratable material for effective photodegradation of the methylene blue in aqueous solution.

Evaluation of dimensionality reduction methods applied to numerical weather models for solar radiation forecasting	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Dimensionality reduction; Interpretability; Solar radiation forecast; Weather research and forecasting model; Support vector regression; Restricted Boltzmann machine	EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; PREDICTION; SELECTION	The interest in solar radiation prediction has increased greatly in recent times among the scientific community. In this context, Machine Learning techniques have shown their ability to learn accurate prediction models. The aim of this paper is to go one step further and automatically achieve interpretability during the learning process by performing dimensionality reduction on the input variables. To this end, three non standard multivariate feature selection approaches are applied, based on the adaptation of strong learning algorithms to the feature selection task, as well as a battery of classic dimensionality reduction models. The goal is to obtain robust sets of features that not only improve prediction accuracy but also provide more interpretable and consistent results. Real data from the Weather Research and Forecasting model, which produces a very large number of variables, is used as the input. As is to be expected, the results prove that dimensionality reduction in general is a useful tool for improving performance, as well as easing the interpretability of the results. In fact, the proposed non standard methods offer important accuracy improvements and one of them provides with an intuitive and reduced selection of features and mesoscale nodes (around 10% of the initial variables centered on three specific nodes).

However, unbalanced battery state of charge (SOC) between cascaded H-bridge inverter modules will degrade an entire system's performance and shorten battery lifespan. This paper proposes a control method to balance battery SOCs of all modules, no matter the intermittent states of each module's PV power. The method is on the basis of battery SOCs, SOC limits of each module, and the total power injected into the power grid. Simulation and experimental results verify the proposed control method that ensures identical SOCs for the battery-energy-stored qZS-CMI PV system.

J	Kelleher, S; Quinn, C; Miller-Lionberg, D; Volckens, J				Kelleher, Scott; Quinn, Casey; Miller-Lionberg, Daniel; Volckens, John			A low-cost particulate matter (PM2.5) monitor for wildland fire smoke	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; LONG-TERM EXPOSURE; AIR-POLLUTION; ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS; PERFORMANCE; POPULATION; ADSORPTION; SENSORS	Wildfires and prescribed fires produce emissions that degrade visibility and are harmful to human health. Smoke emissions and exposure monitoring is critical for public and environmental health protection; however, ground-level measurements of smoke from wildfires and prescribed fires has proven difficult, as existing (validated) monitoring technologies are expensive, cumbersome, and generally require line power. Few ground-based measurements are made during fire events, which limits our ability to assess the environmental and human health impacts of wildland fire smoke. & para;& para;The objective of this work was to develop and validate an Outdoor Aerosol Sampler (OAS) - a filter-based air sampler that has been miniaturized, solar powered, and weatherproofed. This sampler was designed to overcome several of the technical challenges of wildland fire monitoring by being relatively inexpensive and solar powered. The sampler design objectives were achieved by leveraging low-cost electronic components, open-source programming platforms, and in house fabrication methods. A direct-reading PM2.5 sensor was selected and integrated with the OAS to provide time-resolved concentration data. Cellular communications established via short message service (SMS) technology were utilized in transmitting online sensor readings and controlling the sampling device remotely. A Monte Carlo simulation aided in the selection of battery and solar power necessary to independently power the OAS, while keeping cost and size to a minimum.& para;& para;Thirteen OAS were deployed to monitor smoke concentrations downwind from a large prescribed fire. Aerosol mass concentrations were interpolated across the monitoring network to depict smoke concentration gradients in the vicinity of the fire. Strong concentration gradients were observed (spatially and temporally) and likely present due to a combination of changing fire location and intensity, topographical features (e.g., mountain ridges), and diurnal weather patterns. Gravimetric filter measurements made by the OAS (when corrected for filter collection efficiency) showed relatively good agreement with measurements from an EPA federal equivalent monitor. However, the real-time optical sensor (Sharp GP2Y1023AU0F, Sharp Electronic Co.) within the OAS suffered from temperature dependence, drift, and imprecision.

In this paper we present a beta voltaic battery with enhanced beta voltaic effect by using a wide-bandgap semiconductor TiO2 nanotube array thin film. An electrochemical anodic oxidation method is used to prepare the vertically oriented and highly ordered TiO2 nanotube array film on Ti plate. Electrolyte solution consists of ammonium fluoride, ethylene glycol, and deionized water. The structure (TiO2 nanotube array with diameter about 80-100 nm, wall thickness about 15-25 nm, and length 9 mu m) is characterized by field emission scanning electron microscope. The microstructure of the TiO2 nanotube array is characterized using X-ray diffraction. The effects of annealing condition on optical and electrical properties are studied. The electrical property is characterized by Keithley model 2450 source meter semiconductor characterization system in dark at room temperature. The beta voltaic batteries are assembled as a sandwiched structure (Ni-63/TiO2 nanotube arrays film/Ti) using a radioisotope Ni-63 plate and TiO2 nanotube array films. The experimental results show that the black TiO2 nanotube array film annealed at 450 degrees C in argon atmosphere could creates high visible-ultraviolet absorption due to a great many of oxygen vacancy defects generated in TiO2 nanotube array film. The oxygen vacancy signals are found by electron spin resonance. Compared with the planar structure, the nano-porous array structure has strong absorption to beta particles: most of the beta particles enter into the pores and are reflected or absorbed by the surface of the tube walls. With a 10 mCi Ni-63 radiation source, the beta voltaic battery using black TiO2 nanotube array film can generate an open-circuited voltage of 1.02 V, a short-circuited current of 75.52 nA, and a maximum effective conversion efficiency of 22.48%.

One of the greatest challenges towards large-scale implementation of this technology is improving storage capacity and efficiency. The conventional solar-storage architecture, where rechargeable batteries and solar cells are externally coupled, typically results in addition of unnecessary efficiency and reliability margins in design, redundancy of resources (i.e. higher cost), and missed opportunities to increase performance through synergistic integration. Here we overcome these challenges by developing an organic-inorganic hybrid photoelectrochemical storage cell (PESC) to capture and store energy at the point of solar energy generation. The PESC was built by integrating a TiO2 photoelectrode and a Quinone-Vanadium redox flow battery (RFB), which gives rise to superior photoelectrochemical reversibility and stability of the PESC. We demonstrated that photoelectron injection from the TiO2 photoelectrode to the catholyte during unbiased photocharging was significantly enhanced by adjusting pH of the supporting electrolyte.

In this manner, self-charging energy devices consisting of photovoltaic cells and energy storage units can serve as sustainable and portable distributed power sources that can concurrently generate and store electric energy without the need for external charging circuits. Herein, an integrated perovskite solar capacitor (IPSC) was realized by combining a perovskite solar cell (PSC) and a supercapacitor in a single device. Taking advantages of nanocarbon electrodes, the IPSCs possess a simple configuration, compact structure, and well-matched operation voltage. The IPSCs could be rapidly charged by different modes (including the photo-charging mode, galvanostatic-charging mode, and photoassisted-galvanostatic-charging mode), and showed a remarkable overall photo-chemical-electricity energy conversion efficiency as high as 7.1% in the photo-charging mode. Moreover, the IPSCs could work efficiently under weak light illumination. This study provides new insights for the design of novel integrative energy devices that combine the functions of solar power harvesting and electrochemical energy storage.

While IPL of chalcogenide NPs is demonstrated, there is limited work on prediction of crystalline phase of the film and the impact of optical properties of the substrate. Here we characterize and model the evolution of film temperature and crystalline phase during IPL of chalcogenide copper sulfide NP films on glass. Recrystallization of the film to crystalline covellite and digenite phases occurs at 126 degrees C and 155 degrees C respectively within 2-7 seconds. Post-IPL films exhibit p-type behavior, lower resistivity (similar to 10(-3)-10(-4)Omega-cm), similar visible transmission and lower near-infrared transmission as compared to the as-deposited film. A thermal model is experimentally validated, and extended by combining it with a thermodynamic approach for crystal phase prediction and via incorporating the influence of film transmittivity and optical properties of the substrate on heating during IPL. The model is used to show the need to a-priori control IPL parameters to concurrently account for both the thermal and optical properties of the film and substrate in order to obtain a desired crystalline phase during IPL of such thin films on paper and polycarbonate substrates.

To utilize energy distribution in an efficient manner, demand side management has become the fore-runner. In our research paper, we use game theory as a tool to model our system as a Stackelberg game. We make use of different energy sources like solar energy, energy from battery and energy from the provider to run appliances of a subscriber. We consider the scenario where the subscriber can give excess energy that is generated, back to the grid, thereby reducing the load on the grid during peak hours. We design a pricing scheme to calculate the utilities of the subscriber and the provider and show how our model maximizes the utility of the entire system, thereby showing the existence of a Nash equilibrium.

Characterization of Storage Sizing for an Off-Grid House in the US and the Netherlands	ENERGIES			English	Article						household; batteries; storage; sizing; islanded; off-grid; Sea-Salt battery	ENERGY-STORAGE; PV; SYSTEMS; COSTS	This work uses experimental data to estimate the size of storage needed for an isolated off-grid household in two different regions (Austin, Texas, US, and Nunspeet, NL). In our study, an off-grid house is considered to be supplied with 100% renewable energy during the summer period, in which cooling demand is neglected, and a solar photovoltaic (PV) system and batteries are the main electrical energy providers. Based on results achieved with the DEMkit simulation package we can conclude that, in both cases, using a solar PV system and a Sea-Salt battery would have been sufficient to provide the necessary electricity without showing a blackout during the summer of 2016. The Austin household needs a solar PV system of 38 kWp and storage of 452 kWh; in the case of Nunspeet, a solar PV system of 11.5 kWp and storage of 90 kWh is sufficient. Furthermore, using the DEMkit model, it is possible to determine an optimal value for the size of storage to half of the initial battery capacity (226 kWh for Austin and 45 kWh for Nunspeet) and still be able to provide enough power to cover the load demand of the households during the summer. In a second part, data of the solar PV system and load from Austin for one specific week was used to create data of a 'typical' but downscaled day. This day was used to determine the fluctuation of electricity for a real Sea-Salt battery for the considered off-grid scenario in Austin. The downscaling of the data was needed in order to have load values that fit to the size of the real battery. The tests show that the Sea-Salt battery under real electricity fluctuations is possibly adequate for off-grid scenarios.

Aiming to improve the constant pulse charging in wide use today, we propose for the first time to modulate the current pulses during the charging process to reconcile health protection with charging pace. Toward this end, we use an equivalent circuit model and then formulate the problem of optimal pulse charging with an awareness of both battery health and charging speed. We then propose to resolve it using the linear control theory and obtain two charging methods, which regulate the magnitude and width, respectively, of the current pulses applied during the charging process. The proposed methods promise a two-fold benefit. First, the pulse-modulated charging will offer an effective means to defend the battery against the charging-induced harm to health without much compromise of the charging speed. Second, the methods have low computational cost, thus suitable for embedded battery management systems (BMSs) with constrained computing capabilities. This compares with the many charging techniques in the literature that require time-consuming constrained optimization. A detailed simulation study of the two proposed methods is offered to evaluate their effectiveness. The study endows pulse charging with a formalized design methodology unavailable before and impose a stronger health protection during its execution, which together can potentially translate into the momentum for its real-world application to Li-ion battery-powered systems including consumer electronics devices, electrical vehicles and solar photovoltaic arrays.

Designing moving magnet pumps for high-temperature, liquid-metal systems	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							ELECTROMAGNETIC PUMPS; TECHNOLOGIES; BATTERIES; FLUID	Moving magnet pumps (MMP's) operate on the same principles as other induction-style electromagnetic pumps. However, MMP's generate a travelling magnetic field with a spinning array of permanent magnets instead of polyphase field coils. This difference allows MMP's to be made much more quickly, reliably, and inexpensively than other types of electromagnetic pumps. For these reasons, MMP's are a promising technology that can be used to enhance liquid-metal systems in the nuclear, concentrated solar power, and energy storage industries. This paper will provide a background on MMP design and present an updated theory that can accurately predict MMP performance - even if the magnetic field produced by the MMP is non-sinusoidal. The new theory will be tested for a range of operating conditions (magnet configurations, magnet spacing, magnet type, etc.) and compared to experimental results.	[Hvasta, M.

However, finding the ideal configuration for the installation of a hybrid system composed of solar photovoltaic (PV)-diesel generation is a complex task. In this sense, the objective of this study is to develop an approach to select the optimal configuration of hybrid power generation systems for isolated regions by means of combining the techniques of Mixing Design of Experiments, Normal Boundary Intersection and analysis of super efficiency using Data Envelopment Analysis. The proposed approach is applied to a set of four isolated regions in the northern region of Brazil, more specifically in the state of Amazonas. The results show that for each region a different configuration is selected but with large shares of diesel generation at first. On the other hand, all these cases represent points in the Pareto frontier that are the most inefficient due to the high volume of CO2 emissions. From the application of the proposed approach, significant CO2 emission reductions are obtained by selecting the optimal configurations represented as the most efficient points in the Pareto frontier. Our results show that due to conflicting characteristics of the selected objectives, the installation of such hybrid power generation systems produces an increase in LCOE, mainly related to the high costs of the batteries, although less accentuated than the reductions in emissions.

Using a hybrid density functional calculation, Al-intercalated Chevrel phase Mo6S8 with end product Al4/3Mo6S8 is predicted to be a semiconductor with a 1.18 eV indirect band gap. Compared with GaAs and Si, Al4/3Mo6S8 shows significantly higher optical absorption over the solar spectrum as a result of the parallel bands across the band gap with direct transitions around 1.35 eV, nearly ideal for an absorber material in a solar cell. Chevrel phase Mo6S8 has recently been explored as a cathode material in rechargeable Al-ion batteries. Thus, Al4/3Mo6S8 is a potential dual-function (or Janus) material for both energy generation and storage. A possible device structure utilizing this unique property has been proposed.

In this study, we present a one-step electrochemical method for the deposition of nanocrystalline titanium dioxide films on different carbon substrates. By optimizing the synthetic conditions, electrodeposition of nanocrystalline and porous titanium dioxide layers was achieved in only a few minutes. To deconvolute the complex effect of the solution pH and temperature, as well as the deposition potential, a set of systematic experiments was carried out on glassy carbon electrodes. The robustness and general applicability of this synthetic approach is demonstrated by extending it to graphene film electrodes. The phase composition of TiO2 was controlled by varying the solution composition. The photoelectrochemical performance of the electrodeposited titanium dioxide films was better than, or at least comparable to the benchmark P25 titanium dioxide films. Hydrogen-ion intercalation measurements for the TiO2/graphene electrodes indicated promising charge storage capacity, which might be exploited in the future in Li-ion batteries.

The research discussed in this paper uses Modelica-based simulation to compare the efficiency of DC building power distribution with an equivalent alternating current (AC) distribution. The buildings are all modeled with solar generation, battery storage, and loads that are representative of the most efficient building technology. A variety of parametric simulations determine how and when DC distribution proves advantageous. These simulations also validate previous studies that use simpler approaches and arithmetic efficiency models. This work shows that using DC distribution can be considerably more efficient: a medium sized office building using DC distribution has an expected baseline of 12% savings, but may also save up to 18%. In these results, the baseline simulation parameters are for a zero net energy (ZNE) building that can island as a microgrid. DC is most advantageous in buildings with large solar capacity, large battery capacity, and high voltage distribution. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Receding horizon optimization-based approaches to managing supply voltages and power flows in a distribution grid with battery storage co-located with solar PV	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Solar photovoltaics; Residential battery; Quadratic program; Distribution grid; Supply voltages	DEMAND RESPONSE; ENERGY MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM; PENETRATION; REAL; TIME	In this paper we propose two optimization-based algorithms for coordinating residential battery storage to balance increases in daily operational savings that accrue to residential customers with the management of bidirectional power flows in the distribution grid. Bi-directional power flows are managed to improve the supply voltage for residential customers with rooftop solar PV, in addition to alleviating (potentially infrequent) congestion that occurs in the evening when PV production is unavailable. Our objectives are threefold: (1) to reduce reverse power flow leading to significant voltage rise; (2) to reduce peak loads creating sustained under-voltages and/or approaching a network thermal capacity; and (3) to increase operational savings for the residential customer. To achieve our objectives we present a Distributed-Receding Horizon Optimization (D-RHO) algorithm, wherein charge and discharge rates of residential battery storage are coordinated so as to directly influence power flows along a distribution feeder. We also present an Adaptive-Receding Horizon Optimization (A RHO) algorithm, in which charge and discharge rates of residential battery storage are coordinated to more directly manage supply voltages. To assess the distributor benefit, both RHO-based algorithms are applied to a publicly available model of an Australian distribution region located in Elermore Vale. The results of this case study confirm that the A-RHO algorithm improves supply voltages in a low voltage network, and that the D-RHO algorithm offers a peak load reduction of 32% along the Elermore Vale medium voltage feeder.

For example, the formation of a chemical bond between two iodide anions to form a divalent polyiodide anion is seemingly prohibited due to Coulombic repulsion. Using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we show that in the 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium (EMIM)/I-3 ionic crystal, the reactive formation of divalent and even trivalent polyiodide anions occurs with extremely small energetic barriers, due to the electrostatic field of the ionic lattice. A practical consequence of this anomalous reactivity is that iodide anions are efficiently transported within the crystal through a "Grotthuss-exchange" mechanism involving bond-breaking and forming events. We characterize two distinct transport pathways, involving both I-4(2)-and I-7(3) intermediates, with fast transport of iodide resulting from the release of an I-anion on the opposite side of the intermediate species from the initial bond formation. The ordered cation arrangement in the crystal provides the necessary electrostatic screening for close approach of anions, suggesting a new counterintuitive approach to obtain high ionic, conductivity. This new design principle could be used to develop better solid-state electrolytes for batteries, fuel cells, and supercapacitors.

However, the widespread application of conventional RFBs is limited by the uncompetitive performance, as well as the high cost and environmental concerns associated with the use of metal-based redox species. In consideration of advantageous features such as potentially low cost, vast molecular diversity, and highly tailorable properties, organic and organometallic molecules emerge as promising alternative electroactive species for building sustainable RFBs. This review presents a systematic molecular engineering scheme for designing these novel redox species. We provide detailed synthetic strategies for modifying the organic and organometallic redox species in terms of solubility, redox potential, and molecular size. Recent advances are then introduced covering the reaction mechanisms, specific functionalization methods, and electrochemical performances of redox species classified by their molecular structures. Finally, we conclude with an analysis of the current challenges and perspectives on future directions in this emerging research field.

Lithium-metal batteries including lithium-sulfur and lithium-oxygen cells have much higher theoretical energy density than lithium-ion batteries. Reckoned as the ideal anode, however, Li has many challenges when directly used, especially its tendency to form dendrite. Under bending conditions, the Li-dendrite growth can be further aggravated due to bending-induced local plastic deformation and Li-filaments pulverization. Here, the Li-metal anodes are made bending tolerant by integrating Li into bendable scaffolds such as reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) films. In the composites, the bending stress is largely dissipated by the scaffolds. The scaffolds have increased available surface for homogeneous Li plating and minimize volume fluctuation of Li electrodes during cycling. Significantly improved cycling performance under bending conditions is achieved. With the bending-tolerant r-GO/Li-metal anode, bendable lithium-sulfur and lithium-oxygen batteries with long cycling stability are realized. A bendable integrated solar cell-battery system charged by light with stable output and a series connected bendable battery pack with higher voltage is also demonstrated. It is anticipated that this bending-tolerant anode can be combined with further electrolytes and cathodes to develop new bendable energy systems.

Other than the pursuit of high energy density of secondary batteries, an alternative approach recently drawing intensive attention from the research community, is to integrate energy-generation and energy-storage devices into self-charging power systems (SCPSs), so that the scavenged energy can be simultaneously stored for sustainable power supply. This paper reviews recent developments in SCPSs with the integration of various energy-harvesting devices (including piezoelectric nanogenerators, triboelectric nanogenerators, solar cells, and thermoelectric nanogenerators) and energy-storage devices, such as batteries and supercapacitors. SCPSs with multiple energy-harvesting devices are also included. Emphasis is placed on integrated flexible or wearable SCPSs. Remaining challenges and perspectives are also examined to suggest how to bring the appealing SCPSs into practical applications in the near future.

In particular, the oxidation-reduction (redox) properties of these stable radicals have made them a substantial contributor to the progress of organic batteries. Moreover, the use of radical-based materials in photovoltaic devices and thermoelectric systems has allowed for these emerging molecules to have impacts in the energy conversion realm. Additionally, the unique doublet states of radical-based materials provide access to otherwise inaccessible spin states in optoelectronic devices, offering many new opportunities for efficient usage of energy in light-emitting devices.

J	Craig, MT; Jaramillo, P; Hodge, BM				Craig, Michael T.; Jaramillo, Paulina; Hodge, Bri-Mathias			Carbon dioxide emissions effects of grid-scale electricity storage in a decarbonizing power system	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						decarbonization; electricity storage; power systems; climate change mitigation; carbon dioxide emissions; battery	ENERGY-STORAGE; ECONOMICS; SECTOR	While grid-scale electricity storage (hereafter 'storage') could be crucial for deeply decarbonizing the electric power system, it would increase carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in current systems across the United States. To better understand how storage transitions from increasing to decreasing system CO2 emissions, we quantify the effect of storage on operational CO2 emissions as a power system decarbonizes under a moderate and strong CO2 emission reduction target through 2045. Under each target, we compare the effect of storage on CO2 emissions when storage participates in only energy, only reserve, and energy and reserve markets. We conduct our study in the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) system and use a capacity expansion model to forecast generator fleet changes and a unit commitment and economic dispatch model to quantify system CO2 emissions with and without storage. We find that storage would increase CO2 emissions in the current ERCOT system, but would decrease CO2 emissions in 2025 through 2045 under both decarbonization targets. Storage reduces CO2 emissions primarily by enabling gas-fired generation to displace coal-fired generation, but also by reducing wind and solar curtailment. We further find that the market in which storage participates drives large differences in the magnitude, but not the direction, of the effect of storage on CO2 emissions.

With increasing penetration of renewable resources, it is important that this balancing is done effectively, considering the high uncertainty of wind and solar energy. Storing electrical energy can make the grid more reliable and efficient and energy storage is proposed as a complement to highly variable renewable energy sources. However, for investments in energy storage to increase, participating in the market must become economically viable for owners. This paper proposes a stochastic formulation of a storage owner's arbitrage profit maximization problem under uncertainty in day-ahead and real-time market prices. The proposed model helps storage owners in market bidding and operational decisions and in estimation of the economic viability of energy storage. Case study results on realistic market price data show that the novel stochastic bidding approach does significantly better than the deterministic benchmark.

Spatial atomic layer deposition for coating flexible porous Li-ion battery electrodes	JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY A			English	Article							SOLAR-CELL PASSIVATION; COULOMBIC EFFICIENCY; ALUMINA; AL2O3; TRIMETHYLALUMINUM; PERFORMANCE; STABILITY; COMPOSITE; SILICON; FILMS	Ultrathin atomic layer deposition (ALD) coatings on the electrodes of Li-ion batteries can enhance the capacity stability of the Li-ion batteries. To commercialize ALD for Li-ion battery production, spatial ALD is needed to decrease coating times and provide a coating process compatible with continuous roll-to-roll (R2R) processing. The porous electrodes of Li-ion batteries provide a special challenge because higher reactant exposures are needed for spatial ALD in porous substrates. This work utilized a modular rotating cylinder spatial ALD reactor operating at rotation speeds up to 200 revolutions/min (RPM) and substrate speeds up to 200 m/min. The conditions for spatial ALD were adjusted to coat flexible porous substrates. The reactor was initially used to characterize spatial Al2O3 and ZnO ALD on flat, flexible metalized polyethylene terephthalate foils. These studies showed that slower rotation speeds and spacers between the precursor module and the two adjacent pumping modules could significantly increase the reactant exposure. The modular rotating cylinder reactor was then used to coat flexible, model porous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membranes. The uniformity of the ZnO ALD coatings on the porous AAO membranes was dependent on the aspect ratio of the pores and the reactant exposures. Larger reactant exposures led to better uniformity in the pores with higher aspect ratios. The reactant exposures were increased by adding spacers between the precursor module and the two adjacent pumping modules. The modular rotating cylinder reactor was also employed for Al2O3 ALD on porous LiCoO2 (LCO) battery electrodes. Uniform Al coverages were obtained using spacers between the precursor module and the two adjacent pumping modules at rotation speeds of 25 and 50 RPM. The LCO electrodes had a thickness of similar to 49 mu m and pores with aspect ratios of similar to 12-25. Coin cells were then constructed using the ALD-coated LCO electrodes and were tested to determine their battery performance. The capacity of the Al2O3 ALD-coated LCO battery electrodes was measured versus the number of charge-discharge cycles. Both temporal and spatial ALD processing methods led to higher capacity stability compared with uncoated LCO battery electrodes. The results for improved battery performance were comparable for temporal and spatial ALD-coated electrodes. The next steps are also presented for scale-up to R2R spatial ALD using the modular rotating cylinder reactor. Published by the AVS.

Many efforts have been devoted to developing high active ORR and OER bifunctional electrocatalysts to improve the efficiency of devices. However, the possibility of using free solar energy in ORR/OER electrocatalysts to get higher efficiency in the devices has not yet been recognized. Herein, we report a photo-responsive bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalyst with a built-in p-n heterojunction based on Ni12P5 nanoparticles (NPs) coupled strongly with nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNT). The Ni12P5@NCNT hybrid catalyst exhibited unusually high catalytic activities for both ORR (onset potential at 0.90 V vs. RHE) and OER (eta = 360mV @ 10 mA cm(-2)) in 0.1 M KOH solution with a.E (E-j (=) (OER)(10) - E-1/2(ORR)) = 0.82 V, comparable to that of its state-of-the-art counterparts (e.g., Pt for ORR, IrO2 for OER). Upon light irradiation (300 W Xenon lamp equipped with an AM 1.5G filter, 5 cm to electrode), the Delta E further decreased to 0.80 V. A rechargeable Zn-air battery devised from a Ni12P5@NCNT cathode in 6 M KOH/0.2 M Zn(Ac)(2) exhibited a low charge-discharge voltage gap (similar to 0.75 V @ 10 mA cm(-2), charge potential = 1.94 V and discharge potential = 1.19 V) and a remarkable cycling stability over 500 cycles, which, upon the light irradiation, showed an even lower charge potential of 1.90 V and higher discharge potential of 1.22 V (i.e., a charge-discharge voltage gap: 0.68 V @ 10 mA cm(-2)). The irradiation caused also a concomitant increase in the round-trip efficiency from similar to 61.3% to similar to 64.2%. To demonstrate the potential applications in portable/wearable electronic devices, we have also developed all solid-state flexible photo-assisted rechargeable Zn-air batteries based on the Ni12P5@NCNT air electrode with high-performance in the both presence and absence of light irradiation. This conceptual demonstration of the first photo-responsive ORR/OER bifunctional catalyst is significant as it reveals a novel catalytic mechanism, from which a class of new bifunctional catalysts with further enhanced photo-responsive performance could be developed, using in other rechargeable metal-air batteries.

This study evaluates the combined effect of aggregating demand, photovoltaic generation and electricity storage, on-site consumption of PV and its impact on the grid. Data sets with real aggregated electricity demand from grid distribution transformers were used and the PV potential of building facades and rooftops was estimated. The amount of PV in each orientation in the facades and rooftops was optimized maximizing self-sufficiency and minimizing net load variance. Two storage management strategies were investigated: one for maximizing self-consumption and the other to reduce net load variance. We show that the aggregation of the demand and PV potential from different building surfaces in the urban context translates into a better demand-supply match, therefore minimizing storage needs. Higher storage capacities with proper management strategy are needed for mitigation of unmanageable net load variance and consequent costs for the grid operator.	[Freitas, S.; Brito, M.

Smart Gardening IoT Soil Sheets for Real-Time Nutrient Analysis	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article								Agriculture sector has been greatly influenced by the recent advances in electrical engineering. Nitrogen (N), from fertilizer, remains one of the largest input to surface and groundwater contamination, resulting in environmental and human health degradation. This paper explores the use of wireless potentiometry in field settings for in situ N monitoring. We report a disposable IoT gardening soil sheet, capable of analyzing real-time soil nitrate concentration during leaching and irrigation events. The nitrate doped polypyrrole ion selective electrode (N-doped PPy ISE) sensor array sheet features a fault tolerant circuit design multiplexed to an oxidation and reduction potentiometer that can rapidly detect nitrate levels in soil leachates. Measurement data are transmitted via Waspmote ZB Pro SMA 5dBi radio, 6600mAh rechargeable battery, 7.4-volt solar panel, and a Meshlium ZigBee PRO access point to cloud server and mobile device. This paper investigates the gardening IoT sheets as a viable tool for in situ nitrate mapping, and to potentially help everyday home and commercial gardeners reduce excessive fertilizer application.

Redox flow batteries are a type of grid-scale energy storage technology that shows exceptional promise for accommodating the dynamic output of wind and solar power sources. The research community employs dozens of diagnostic techniques to investigate nearly all facets of these devices. Material properties, operational losses, transport, and integrated system properties are studied through the lens of electrochemical, physical, and chemical phenomena that ultimately dictate cost by influencing efficiency, durability, power, and capacity. These diagnostic techniques can, if applied correctly, elucidate not only the types of losses in redox flow batteries, but also tie those losses to fundamental driving forces in such systems so that next generation systems and models can be designed. This review details various diagnostic techniques used in flow battery analysis. The benefits, unique insights, and limitations of these techniques are discussed. Recommendations are also made to assist researchers in identifying the diagnostics that can advance their particular investigations. The review concludes with a summary of opportunities for new diagnostics that are needed to enable solution of persistent issues in redox flow battery research and development.

A battery of innovative choices-if we commit to investing	BULLETIN OF THE ATOMIC SCIENTISTS			English	Article						Batteries; energy storage; renewables; R&D; innovation	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; ENERGY; INVESTMENT; SYSTEMS	Renewable energy - such as photovoltaics and wind power - is rapidly moving into the mainstream, with global solar capacity set to outproduce nuclear energy capacity for the first time. But a major holdup has been how to store the electricity produced by renewables; consequently, good, cheap, long-lasting battery storage has been the Holy Grail of R&D in this area. But how close are we in reaching this goal? To track progress, the authors have introduced a new, "two-factor" model of analyzing innovations in energy storage that accounts not only for total sales of a particular technology but also for the degree of investment in innovation, measured by looking at the number of new patents issued in energy storage technology.

These aircraft present a complicated systems engineering problem because of the multifaceted interaction between aerodynamics, structures, environmental effects, and engine, battery, and other component performance. Using geometric programming, models capturing the interaction between disciplines are used to analyze the feasible limits of solar-electric and gas-powered, long-endurance aircraft in seconds to a level of detail and speed not previously achieved in initial aircraft sizing and design. The results show that long-endurance, gas-powered aircraft are generally more robust to higher wind speeds than solar-powered aircraft but are limited in their endurance by the amount of fuel that they can carry. Although solar-electric-powered aircraft can theoretically fly for months, they are operationally limited by reduced solar flux during the winter and wind speeds at higher latitudes. A detailed trade study between gas-powered and solar-powered aircraft is performed to discover which architecture is best suited to meet a given set of requirements and what is the optimum size and endurance of that platform.

This hybridization method is modeled after the power distribution methods found in living organisms, which utilize glycogen stores and adipose tissue to optimize power and energy density strengths and weaknesses. A UGV rover was constructed with an appropriate distribution of power storage elements creating separate power buffers. The primary buffer consisted of a 10 W solar panel array and a 600 F, 5.4 V supercapacitor bank, and the secondary buffer consisted of a 3.7 V 6 Ah lithium-ion battery pack. The primary buffer provided virtually limitless charge cycles with a superior power density juxtaposed with a secondary buffer that provided superior energy density and volumetric versatility. The design of this rover is presented in this paper; it was tested under manual and autonomous modes. The rover was found to be capable of effectively operating solely on the primary power buffer in high to low luminous conditions while being able to carry out basic extravehicular activities. The rover could travel roughly 22 km without any input power on a full charge of both buffers, and could smoothly switch between its own power buffers during operation, all while transmitting live first person video (FPV) and network data. The introduction of control algorithms on the onboard microcontroller unit (MCU) was also explored in both manual and autonomous configurations. The latter integrated linear regression to intelligently manage power and locomotion based on sensory data from photoresistors.

We highlight some features of alternative and sustainable energy resources and discuss some challenges for their integration into the power grid. In view of global trend toward blending alternatives and conventional energy resources in electrical power grids, a more robust energy distribution approach is necessary. Here, we present an alternative to the power grid with great potential for integrating alternative energy sources and defining microgrids-the Controlled-Delivery Grid (CDG). We comment how this new digital approach enhances the distribution of energy may help to resolve those challenges. We also examine the role of energy storage elements (batteries, super-capacitors), and sustainable energy resources in this new approach to the power grid. We provide some numerical analysis on the performance of energy distribution of the CDG and some experimental results that highlight some of its features.

Self-powered sensor systems capable of quasi-perpetual operation enable the possibility of truly continuous monitoring of patients beyond the clinic. However, the discontinuous and dynamic characteristics of harvesting in real-world scenarios-and their implications for the design and operation of self-powered systems-are not yet well understood. This paper presents a mobile energy harvesting and data collection (EHDC) platform designed to provide a deeper understanding of energy harvesting dynamics. The EHDC platform monitors and records the instantaneous usable power generated by body-worn harvesters, while also collecting human activity and environmental data to provide a comprehensive real-world evaluation of two energy harvesting modalities common to body sensor networks: solar and thermoelectric. The platform was initially validated with benchtop tests and later with real-world deployments on two subjects. 7-h-long multimodal energy harvesting profiles were generated, and the environmental and behavioral data were used to expand upon previously developed Kalman filter based mathematical models for energy harvesting prediction. Results confirm the validity of the EHDC platform and harvesting models, establishing the potential for longer term monitoring of energy harvesting characteristics; thus, informing the design and operation of self-powered body sensor networks.

In this paper, the EMS controls battery storage to shape the fluctuated photovoltaic (PV) plant output into a relatively constant power and support the peak load. The proposed integrated design method considers both battery size and EMS impacts on the utility benefits and cost. The utility benefits include power generation, peak power support, and reduced line losses. The cost of battery storage is determined by the size and lifetime based on the developed battery models. Accordingly, the utility revenue change due to the battery storage controlled by EMS can be evaluated. Therefore, the integrated design of battery size and EMS can be determined by managing the change of utility revenue to gain economic benefits for the large-scale PV power plant application. Finally, the lithium-ion phosphate (LiFePO4) battery and lead-acid battery are compared to demonstrate the proposed method on a utility system model, respectively.
