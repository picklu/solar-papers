This, in turn, calls for advanced power management that jointly considers power demand by the operations and power supply from various sources, such as batteries, solar panels, and supercapacitors. In this article, we develop a power scheduling framework for a reliable energy storage system with multiple power-supply sources and multiple power-demand operations. Specifically, we develop offline power-supply guarantee analysis and online power management. The former provides an offline power-supply guarantee such that every power-demand operation completes its execution in time while the sum of power required by individual operations does not exceed the total power supplied by the entire energy storage system at any time; to this end, we develop a plain power-supply analysis as well as its improved version using real-time scheduling techniques. On the other hand, the latter efficiently utilizes the surplus power available at runtime for improving system performance; we propose two approaches, depending on whether future scheduling information of power-demanding tasks is available or not. For evaluation, we perform simulations to evaluate both the plain and improved analyses for offline power guarantee under various synthetic power-demand operations. In addition, we have built a simulation model and demonstrated that the proposed framework with the offline analysis and online management not only guarantees the required power-supply, but also enhances system performance by up to 56.49 percent.

Here, we demonstrate an efficient photoelectrochemical-assisted rechargeable seawater battery. By integrating TiO2 nanostructure-based photoelectrodes with the seawater battery, we achieved significant enhancement of the voltage efficiency during the charging/discharging processes; effective photocharging with the TiO2 photoanode reduced the charging voltage to similar to 2.65 V, while the heated carbon felt (HCF) cathode in the seawater battery exhibited charging/discharging voltages of similar to 3.8 V and similar to 2.9 V, respectively. Such a charging voltage reduction led to a voltage efficiency of similar to 109%. Moreover, interestingly, we found that TiO2 nanostructures showed excellent photoelectrochemical performances in seawater in association with the efficient photocharging. As a result, the utilization of TiO2 nanostructures as photocharging/discharging electrodes provides a feasible strategy to optimize the cell configuration for highly efficient solar seawater batteries.

Bending test methodologies to estimate long-term reliability during repeated mechanical deformation are attracting substantial interest from related researchers and industry insiders. In this study, four representative bending test methodologies for testing flexible electronics are introduced: free arc bending test, variable radius bending test, sliding plate test, and variable angle test. Correct name and characteristics of each method are also explained. Furthermore, electrical reliability of Cu film on polymer substrate samples was investigated in each bending test method through in situ monitoring of electrical resistance. With different bending test methodologies, different electrical resistance changes were observed. Fatigue damages occurred at different areas. Obtained electrical reliability and failure modes were analyzed by observing crack morphologies.

Indium tin oxide (ITO), a representative transparent conducting oxide (TCO) material, is widely used as the electrode for displays, solar cells, etc. Titanium nitride (TiN) is a well-used material as an interlayer for improving the adhesion between two materials. In this study, ITO or TiN thin films were used as an interlayer to improve the adhesion between a CNW and a substrate. The interlayer was deposited on the substrate using a radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering system with a four-inch TiN or ITO target. CNWs were grown on the interlayer-coated substrate using a microwave-plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (MPECVD) system with a mixture of methane (CH4) and hydrogen (H-2) gases. The adhesion of the CNW/interlayer/substrate structure was observed through ultrasonic cleaning.

The pristine graphitic structure of CNMs consists of sp(2) hybrid C-C bonds and is considered to be neutral in nature with low wettability and poor reactivity. To improve its compatibility with other materials and, hence, for greater applicability, CNMs are generally required to be functionalized effectively and/or doped with heteroatoms in their graphitic frameworks for feasible interfacial interactions. Among the various possible functional/doping elements, nitrogen (N) atoms have received much attention given their potential to fine tune the intrinsic properties, such as the work-function, charge carrier concentration, surface energy, and polarization, of CNMs. N-doping improves the surface energy and reactivity with enhanced charge polarization and minimal damage to carbon frameworks. The modified surface energy and chemical activity of N-doped carbon nanomaterials (NCNMs) can be useful for a broad range of applications, including fuel cells, solar cells, Li-ion batteries, supercapacitors, chemical catalysts, catalyst supports, and so forth.

Herein, core-shell-like copper (Cu) hydroxide nanotube arrays grafted nickel aluminum layered double hydroxide nanosheets were facilely synthesized on porous Cu foam (CH NTAs@NiAl LDH NSs) for use as an efficient battery-type electrode in hybrid SCs. With the synergistic effects of NiAl LDH NSs on well-adhered CH NTAs/CF, the core-shell-like composite (prepared for 24 h) delivered a maximum areal capacity of 334.3 mu Ah/cm(2) at a current density of 3 mA/cm(2) in 2 M KOH electrolyte, which is comparatively higher than other samples synthesized at different growth times. Moreover, the core-shell-like CH NTAs@NiAl LDH NSs-24 demonstrated an outstanding cycling stability of 134.3% after 10,000 cycles. Utilizing high capacity and stability of CH NTAs@NiAl LDH NSs-24, a pouch-type hybrid SC was further assembled with core-shell-like composite as a positive electrode and reduced graphene oxide as a negative electrode with a filter paper as a separator in aqueous alkaline electrolyte. The hybrid SC showed a high areal capacity of 250 mu Ah/cm(2) at 2 mA/cm(2) with maximum areal energy and power densities of 181.9 mu Wh/cm(2) and 24,991.5 mu W/cm(2), respectively. Successfully harvesting the solar energy via solar cell panel and subsequently delivering the stored energy to switching and proximity applications also demonstrated the real-time applicability of our hybrid SCs.

Taegi, South Korea	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRECISION ENGINEERING AND MANUFACTURING-GREEN TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Wind power; Wind hybrid systems; Energy storage systems; Microgrid simulation	RENEWABLE ENERGY-SOURCES; RURAL ELECTRIFICATION; TECHNOECONOMIC FEASIBILITY; SOLAR; MECHANISMS	In this study, wind-battery hybrid power systems are designed, evaluated, and optimized for regular supply of electrical power at a designated minimum load level with no shortage. Our simulation uses lead-acid batteries and vanadium redox flow batteries (VRBs) for storage, and utilizes hourly wind speed data measured in 2012 at Mt. Taegi in South Korea. Twenty Vestas V80 wind turbines, each rated at 2 MW, are used as power generators, on the basis of an actual wind turbine project recently installed at Mt. Taegi. Sale to the main grid of electricity generated in excess of the minimum load offset the initial capital costs for installation of the wind turbines and batteries. Results show that the optimized wind-VRB hybrid system can supply more than 9 MW of regular electrical power at no cost. Even higher levels of production are profitable with sale of the wind-generated electricity directly to a demand site at a price greater than the price of sales to the main grid. A reduction in the VRB electrolyte costs and an increase in carbon taxes can also increase profitability.

Phase of Fe2O3 in the structure is the key factor determining the battery performance for a high capacity and cyclability. For example, single anodization allows Fe to be dissolved faster than other components such as Cr, resulting in a high Cr ratio in the stainless steel, which deteriorates the retention of the battery capacity during cycling. On the other hand, the Fe-Cr-Ni ratio is not significantly changed if a proper pretreatment for activation, which is able to dissolve all components with a similar dissolution rate in the subsequent anodization step, is performed. The anodic ant-nest nanostructures play a vital role in not only the pathway of Li ions but also releasing the stress of volume expansion during Li insertion/extraction. The optimized electrode delivers a high reversible capacity of 737 mu Ah cm(-2) (737 mAh cm(-3) or 1157 mu Ah g(-1)) at a current density of 650 mu A cm(-2) (1 C-rate) and sustains up to 500 cycles with only 0.13% capacity fading per cycle.

Techniques that transfer energy directly to sensor nodes using wireless power transfer (WPT) have been studied in recent years to address this issue. In this paper, we propose a technique that uses a drone (quadcopter), which is a type of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), as a mobile sink. The drone selects and manages anchor nodes that aggregate data temporarily, collects data by visiting the anchor nodes to mitigate the hotspot issue, and then prevents blackouts by supplying energy to low-energy nodes, thereby improving network connectivity. The anchor nodes are carefully selected after considering the energy capacity of the drone, the size of the network, the amount of collected data, and the energy consumed by the nodes to increase the network's energy efficiency. Furthermore, energy is transferred from the drone to the anchor nodes to support their energy consumption. In our study, this method reduced the blackouts of sensor nodes, including anchor nodes, in hotspot regions, and increased network connectivity, thereby improving the amount of data gathered by the mobile sink.

Each SBS is equipped with a finite-capacity battery that is regularly recharged by a solar harvester. We aims to find the optimal bandwidth allocation policy in order to enhance the network performance in terms of user satisfaction and energy efficiency under energy harvesting and bandwidth sharing constraints. Since the arrivals of harvested energy and traffic requests are unknown due to users' mobility and stochastic request generation, it is necessary to design a learning framework for the controller in order to predict these dynamics through interaction with the environment. For this purpose, we first formulate the resource allocation problem as the framework of a Markov decision process, and then, we employ an actor-critic algorithm to find the optimal policy under which the controller can effectively allocate the limited bandwidth to the SBSs for their data transmissions. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme through comprehensive simulations with different settings, and show that the proposed bandwidth allocation scheme can enhance the network's performance in the long run.

In this work, a prolific approach to design a wind/solar-powered rechargeable high-energy density pouch-type hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) is proposed. The pouch-type HSC is fabricated by engineering nature-inspired nanosliver (nano-Ag) decorated Ni0.67Co0.33S forest-like nanostructures on Ni foam (nano-Ag@NCS FNs/Ni foam) as a battery-type electrode and porous activated carbon as a capacitive-type electrode. Initially, the core-shell-like NCS FNs/Ni foam is prepared via a single-step wet-chemical method, followed by a light-induced growth of nano-Ag onto it for enhancing the conductivity of the composite. Utilizing the synergistic effects of forest-like nano-Ag@NCS FNs/Ni foam as a composite electrode, the fabricated device shows a maximum capacitance of 1104.14 mF cm(-2) at a current density of 5 mA cm(-2) and it stores superior energy and power densities of 0.36 mWh cm(-2) and 27.22 mW cm(-2), respectively along with good cycling stability, which are higher than most of previous reports. The high-energy storage capability of HSCs is further connected to wind fans and solar cells to harvest renewable energy. The wind/solar charged HSCs can effectively operate various electronic devices for a long time, enlightening its potency for the development of sustainable energy systems.	[Nagaraju, Goli; Sekhar, S.

Evidencing enhanced charge-transfer with superior photocatalytic degradation and photoelectrochemical water splitting in Mg modified few-layered SnS2	JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Nanosheets; Few-layered; SnS2; Magnesium; Photocatalysis; Photoelectrochemical water splitting	REDUCED GRAPHENE OXIDE; ION BATTERY ANODE; DOPED SNS2; TIN DISULFIDE; CARBON CLOTH; THIN-FILMS; CYCLE LIFE; PERFORMANCE; NANOSHEETS; NANOCOMPOSITE	Recently there has been immense interest in the exploration of richly available two-dimensional nontoxic layered material such as tin disulfide (SnS2) for potential employment in energy and environmental needs. In this regard, we report on the synthesis of few-layered Sn1-xMgxS2 nanosheets through a facile one-step hydrothermal route to address all such functions concerning photocatalysis and photoelectrochemical conversion. The crystalline order and structure of processed layered Sn1-xMgxS2 were initially found to exhibit a strong influence on their physicochemical properties. Their optical properties attest the Mg doping in SnS2 to benefit us with enhanced visible-light absorption via red-shift in their absorption edge. In the photoluminescence spectrum the emissions observed along visible and red region signifies the association of Mg related trap states in Sn1-xMgxS2. Next, the photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic results revealed the Mg doping to promote the effective charge transfer process (which was beneficial to enhance their photocatalytic activity). Consequently, the layered Sn0.98Mg0.02S2 made photoanodes displayed 1.7 fold higher photocurrent density under simulated solar radiation with respect to their undoped counterpart. Furthermore, the layered Sn0.98Mg0.02S2 nanosheets exhibits enhanced visible light decomposition of organic dye while compared with pristine SnS2 nanosheets. The value of rate constants obtained for the Sn0.98Mg0.02S2 nanosheets was found to be 1.4 times higher than that of pristine SnS2. Finally, the results obtained through the present study projects the huge potential of layered Sn0.98Mg0.02S2 nanosheets for future multifunctional applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, as the PSC contains methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3, MAPbI(3)) in the light-harvesting active layer, addressing the safety issue of PSCs is an important prerequisite for its commercialization. In this study, the potential hazards of the PSC were investigated with consideration of Pb species released from PSC using an ecotoxicity, cytotoxicity, chronic toxicity, and genotoxicity battery assay. PSC and its degradation products can cause significant toxicity, with PSC being more toxic than the individual degradation products. The order of ecotoxicity and cytotoxicity was found to be Pb2+ > PS C > P bI(2) = P bO. Aquatic toxicity of PSC and its degradation products was suggested by Daphnia magna acute, chronic, and genotoxicity results. The current study highlights the non-negligible hazard potentialities of the PSC and its degradation products, as evidenced by our ecotoxicity and cytotoxicity battery assay. Our study indicates that great caution should be taken in the mass production of PSCs and could facilitate proper risk assessment. Based on our study, some considerations on the implementation of the "safe-by-design (SbD)" approach for the sustainable development of PSC technology can be formulated.

To estimate the possible flight time of the UAV, we use the concept of state of charge (SOC) estimation based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and complementary filter (CF) and then calculate the possible flight time by using the slope of the SOC graph during hovering flight mode. According to the results, estimated flight time increases up to 54.14 min at 11:00 a.m. and decreases down to 6.70 min at 18:00 p.m.	[Jung, Sunghun] Dongshin Univ, Dept Elect Vehicle Engn, Naju 58245, Jeollanam Do, South Korea; [Jo, Yonghyeon] Dongshin Univ, Dept Energy Mech Facil, Naju 58245, Jeollanam Do, South Korea; [Kim, Young-Joon] Gachon Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Seongnam Si 13120, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea[Jung, Sunghun] Dongshin Univ, Dept Elect Vehicle Engn, Naju 58245, Jeollanam Do, South Korea; [Jo, Yonghyeon] Dongshin Univ, Dept Energy Mech Facil, Naju 58245, Jeollanam Do, South Korea; [Kim, Young-Joon] Gachon Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Seongnam Si 13120, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea	Jung, S (reprint author), Dongshin Univ, Dept Elect Vehicle Engn, Naju 58245, Jeollanam Do, South Korea.	jungx148@gmail.com; av1483110@gmail.com; youngkim@gachon.ac.krjungx148@gmail.com; av1483110@gmail.com; youngkim@gachon.ac.kr	Jung, Sunghun/G-7341-2016	Jung, Sunghun/0000-0002-4729-8241; Kim, Young-Joon/0000-0003-3511-3438	National Research Foundation of KoreaNational Research Foundation of Korea [2017R1C1B5018040]; Gachon University Research Fund of 2018 [GCU-2018-0294]	This research was funded by the National Research Foundation of Korea (2017R1C1B5018040) and by the Gachon University Research Fund of 2018 (GCU-2018-0294).		22	0	0	0	0	MDPI	BASEL	ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND	1996-1073			ENERGIES	Energies	MAR 1	2019	12	5							867	10.3390/en12050867			15	Energy & Fuels	Energy & Fuels	HQ8AS	WOS:000462646700100		DOAJ Gold			2020-07-03

Herein, the potential of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tetrasodium salt (EDTA-4Na) as a sacrificing sodium supply source was investigated by intimately blending it with sodium-deficient P2-type Na-0.67[Al0.05Mn0.95]O-2. The EDTA-4Na/Na-0.67[Al0.05Mn0.95]O-2 composite electrode unexpectedly exhibited an improved charge capacity of 177 mA h (g-oxide)(-1) compared with the low charge capacity of 83 mA h (g-oxide)(-1) for bare Na (0.67)[Al(0.05)mn(0.95)]O-2. The reversible capacity of an EDTA-4Na/Na-0.67[Al0.05Mn0.95]O-2//hard carbon full-cell system increased to 152 mA h (g-oxide)(-1) at the first discharge with a Coulombic efficiency of 89%, whereas the Na-0.67 [Al0.05Mn0.95]O-2 without EDTA-4Na delivered a discharge capacity 51 mA h g(-1) because of the small charge capacity. The EDTA-4Na sacrificed itself to generate Na+ ions via oxidative decomposition by releasing four sodium ions and producing C3N as a decomposition resultant on charge. It is thought that the slight increase in discharge capacity is associated with the electroconducting nature of the C3N deposits formed on the surface of the Na-0.67[Al0.05Mn0.95]O-2 electrode. We elucidated the reaction mechanism and sacrificial activity of EDTA-4Na, and our findings suggest that the addition of EDTA-4Na is beneficial as an additional source of Na+ ions that contribute to the charge capacity.

Design Considerations for Parallel Differential Power Processing Converters in a Photovoltaic-Powered Wearable Application	ENERGIES			English	Article						photovoltaic power; differential power processing; maximum power point tracking; wearable applications; energy harvesting	POINT TRACKING; ARCHITECTURES; PERFORMANCE	Solar photovoltaic (PV) power is a widely used to supply power to the electric grid but can also be used in lower-power emerging applications, like in wearables or the internet of things. One fundamental challenge of using PV power in flexible wearable applications is that individual PV modules point at various angles, thus receiving different light intensities. Using a series configuration for the PV modules greatly decreases power utilization under uneven irradiance conditions. Parallel differential power processing (DPP) converters are employed to address this power reduction problem, while maintaining individual PV control and maximizing output power. Two parallel DPP configurations, with and without a front-end converter, are analyzed and compared for a target battery-charging application. The DPP system without a front-end converter shows consistently high performance and operates properly over a wider range of lighting conditions. Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms are also examined for parallel DPP systems. When the MPPT parameters are properly calibrated, simulation results indicate that voltage-offset resistive control is the most effective at maximizing PV power under unbalanced lighting conditions.

Core-shell mannered carbon coating was developed by hydrothermal process on exfoliated Tungsten disulfide (e-WS2) to enhance the efficient charge separation, specific surface area with mesoporosity and stability for chemical processes and mechanical strains. The carbon coated e-WS2 nanosheets (C@e-WS2) was performed by series of characterization techniques and explored to the photocatalytic degradation of malachite green (MG) dye by comparing with bulk WS2 and e-WS2. Among all the photocatalysts highest performance was observed for the C@e-WS2. C@e-WS2 catalyst displays more than 11 fold enhancements in the photocomposition rate of MG over bulk WS2 and nearly 8 fold improvements over e-WS2 for 90 min irradiation. In addition, for complete degradation of MG dye over the bulk WS2, e-WS2, and C@e-WS2 catalysts were observed at 150, 130, and 90 min under simulated solar light irradiation. The results obtained using core-shell mannered C@e-WS2 are stepping stone for developing cost-effective and noble metal-free catalysts for photodegradation.	[Vattikuti, S. V.

However, cobalt oxides exist as various phases, such as Co(II)O, Co2(III)O3, Co3(II,III)O4, and the (photo)electrochemical properties of CoOx are significantly governed by its phase. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a suitable method to form a multifunctional layer for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting because it allows direct growth of a conformal high-quality film on various substrates as well as facile control over its chemical phases by adjusting the deposition conditions. Here, a well-controlled CoOx/SiOx/n-Si heterojunction prepared by ALD is demonstrated for solar-driven water splitting. The phase of the ALD CoOx films can be easily controlled from CoO to Co3O4 by varying the deposition temperature. In addition, this systematic study reveals that its energetic as well as electrochemical properties are changed significantly with the phase. Whereas CoO grown at 150 degrees C produces high photovoltage by building desirable hole-selective heterojunctions with n-Si, Co3O4 formed at 300 degrees C has a better catalytic property for water oxidation. To address this competitive correlation, we developed a double-layered (DL) ALD CoO, film that has advantages of both CoO and Co3O4. The DL ALD CoOx/SiOx/Si heterojunction photoanode produces a photocurrent density of 3.5 mA/cm(2) without a buried junction and maintains a saturating current density of 32.5 mA/cm(2) without noticeable degradation during 12 h in 1 M KOH under a simulated 1 sun illumination.

For the first time, we demonstrate that solution-processed am-ZTO thin films are highly efficient as an electron-selective layer (ESL) for mixed perovskite solar cells (PSCs). When am-ZTO ESLs were combined with bandgap-tuned FAMAPbI(3) perovskites, a champion efficiency of 20.02% was achieved. In addition, devices based on am-ZTO showed a statistical reproducibility of 18.38 +/- 0.61% compared to 15.85 +/- 1.02% of the TiO2-based counterparts. This high efficiency is achieved by the significant increase in both the short-circuit current and open circuit voltage owing to improved charge transport/extraction and recombination. Moreover, am-ZTO ESL-based devices show improved stability and reduced hysteresis, which is a promising result for future PSC research.

Here we examine the ability of dynamic (real-time) pricing in off-grid systems to improve the durability of the batteries used to store power. In a randomized controlled trial with a pre-paid solar micro-grid in rural India, we found that dynamic pricing did not improve technical performance or customer satisfaction. The best explanation for the null finding is that, for various reasons, households minimized their power consumption and there was thus little need for demand management. These findings suggest that the low demand for power is a key challenge for the profitability of pre-paid off-grid systems.

Herein, we reported a hierarchical composite consisting of bilayered nickel hydroxide carbonate nanoplates-decorated nanoflowers on nickel foam (NHC NPs@NFs/Ni foam) via a facile homogeneous precipitation method for use as an effective cathode in hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs). Under controlled growth time (4 h), the bilayered NHC NPs@NFs with hierarchical alignment were spontaneously crystallized on Ni foam. The as-preapared hybrid structure greatly enhanced the electroactive surface area and enabled the rapid redox chemistry in alkaline electrolyte. Notably, the hybrid NHC NPs@NFs/Ni foam delivered a maximum areal capacity of 727.4 mu Ah/cm(2) at 2 mA/cm(2) and it is relatively higher than its oxide form (76.6 mu Ah/cm(2)) in a three-electrode system. Also, a pouch-type HSC with bilayered NHC NPs@NFs/Ni foam and porous carbon electrodes was fabricated, which demonstrated superior energy storage performance in terms of capacitance (1445.8 mF/cm(2)), energy density (0.506 mWh/cm(2)), power density (35.675 mW/cm(2)) and cycling stability (89.4%). Furthermore, the self-charging power station consisting of a solar cell for energy conversion and the HSCs for energy storage was also assembled to operate the portable electronic displays and wall clock effectively for long time. This facile approach for the cost-effective fabrication of hierarchically designed nanomaterials paves a path for the development of high-performance hybrid supercapacitors.

The effects of plasticizer, dimethyl carbonate, on the electrical and electrochemical properties of PVP-MSA complexes were plausibly investigated for the first time. The complexation behaviors of both plasticized and unplasticized polymer electrolyte systems were confirmed with the aid of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The conductivity values were found to be enhanced due to the addition of DMC, and a maximum value of 3.27 x 10(-5) S/cm was achieved. The ionic transport number values were found to be in the range of 0.96-0.99. The discharge analysis suggested that the proton battery constructed with the plasticized polymer electrolyte showed better performance compared to that constructed with the unplasticized polymer electrolyte, which in turn means it could be utilized as a promising candidate for primary proton batteries.

This would facilitate the powering of an integrated strain sensor. The planar MSCs comprised electrodes of potentiostatically deposited polypyrrole, on spray-coated multi-walled carbon nanotube film, and a gel-type electrolyte of LiCl/polyvinyl alcohol with a redox additive of 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide. The fabricated MSC achieved an areal capacitance of 5.17 mF cm(-2). After 5000 charge/discharge cycles, the MSC retained 80% of their initial capacitance. A strain sensor was fabricated utilizing a composite film of fragmentized graphene foam and polydimethylsiloxane. Such fabricated twelve parallel connected MSCs, a strain sensor, and SCs were integrated on a single deformable polymer substrate with embedded stiff platforms of negative epoxy series resist (SU-8) via long serpentine interconnections of polyimide encapsulated Ti/Pt metal film for mechanical stability under stretching. After 1000 repetitive biaxial stretching/releasing cycles by 30%, no noticeable change was observed in the charge/discharge behavior of the MSC array. Furthermore, both the photo-charge/discharge characteristics and electrochemical performance remained stable. When the whole integrated system was attached to the wrist, the integrated strain sensor could detect both externally applied strain and the arterial pulse using the energy stored in the MSCs from the SCs.

Low-bandgap CQDs can convert invisible NIR light sources to electrical energy more efficiently than wider spectra because of reduced thermalization loss. This energy-conversion strategy via NIR photons ensures an enhanced photostability of the CQD devices. Furthermore, the NIR wireless charging system can be concealed using various colored and NIR-transparent fabric or films, providing aesthetic freedom. Finally, an NIR-driven wireless charging system is demonstrated for a wearable healthcare bracelet by integrating a CQD PVs receiver with a flexible lithium-ion battery and entirely embedding them into a flexible strap, enabling permanent self-charging without detachment.

These materials show great promise for the development of cleaner power sources to address growing environmental concerns at a time of increasing global demand for energy. Noble metal-free MOF-derived onion slice-type hollow structured Co4S3 was developed and embedded with CdS nanoparticles for photocatalytic hydrogen production. The incorporation of Co4S3 with the CdS particles effectively accelerated charge separation and transfer in photocatalytic reactions due to the low density, hollow interior, and shell permeability of the onion-type composite. The optimized Co4S3/CdS photocatalyst led to an enhanced rate of H-2 production of 12,360 pmol h(-1) g(-1) under simulated solar light irradiation; this value is 26-fold greater than that of the pristine CdS nanoparticles. The Co4S3/CdS composite exhibited remarkably stable photocatalytic performance for up to 65 h and could be reused in five successive cycles. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, this is the highest H-2 production rate achieved with cobalt sulfide-based CdS nanoparticle photocatalysts in the photocatalysis of water under simulated solar light irradiation. Owing to its low cost and high efficiency, this photocatalytic system should hold great potential for the development of highly efficient photocatalytic materials for use in various fields.

Although the development of high-energy density RFB remains a challenging. Herein, we report the Na-aqueous- catholyte RFB (NaAqRFB) towards high-density electrical energy storage. Na-metal anode offers a high energy density and the use of an aqueous flowing catholyte decouples the energy and power. NASICON (Na3Zr2Si2PO12) is employed as a solid electrolyte in the NaAqRFB to separate the Na anode and a flowable aqueous catholyte. The constructed prototype NaAqRFB operates using a sodium-hexacyanoferrate solution as the aqueous catholyte with no added supporting salt/electrolyte, and yielded an average cell potential of similar to 3.06 V (vs. Na/Na+), and an energy density of 54.16 Wh L-1 (based on the volume of catholyte) with high energy efficiency (similar to 92%, over 50 cycles), outperforming conventional RFB. The present work offers a new route for developing high-energy-density redox flow batteries.	[Senthilkumar, S.

This study presents an analysis of the lateral thickness of a coated layer that consists of a fluid with a high viscosity produced by using a slot-die roll-to-roll system with specific attention focused on a pinned edge phenomenon exhibited in the coated layer. A solution viscosity of 832 mPa.s is used and includes relatively high capillary numbers in the experiment in the range of 0.47-3.47. The purpose of the study included analyzing various forces around the coating nozzle and determining the correlation between forces by using dimensionless numbers. Computational fluid dynamics analysis and experiments were performed to obtain various parameters in terms of these dimensionless numbers. The experimental results suggest that the pinned edge should be reduced below 10% by reducing the coating gap parameter that represents the gravity forces.

However, the strong demand for a high H-2 production rate will present conflicting requirements of excellent photoactivity and low-cost photocatalysts. The first alternative may be abundant nanostructured titanate-related materials as a photocatalyst. Here, we report highly dispersed Na2Ti3O7 nanotubes synthesized via a facile hydrothermal route for photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) and the water splitting under UV-visible light irradiation. Compared with commercial TiO2, the nanostructured Na2Ti3O7 demonstrated excellent photodegradation and water splitting performance, thus addressing the need for low-cost photocatalysts. The as-synthesized Na2Ti3O7 nanotubes exhibited desirable photodegradation, and rate of H-2 production was 1,755 mu mol center dot g(-1)center dot h(-1) and 1,130 mu mol center dot g(-1)center dot h(-1) under UV and simulated solar light irradiation, respectively; the resulting as-synthesized Na2Ti3O7 nanotubes are active in UV light than that of visible light response.

Conversely, the effective synthesis of Bi2S3 nanorod core@ amorphous carbon shell heterostructure remains an important challenge. In this study, C@Bi2S3 core-shell heterostructures with enhanced supercapacitor performance were synthesized via sacrificial-template-free one-pot-synthesis method. The highest specific capacities of the C@Bi2S3 core shell was 333.43 F g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1). Core-shell-structured C@Bi2S3 exhibits 1.86 times higher photocatalytic H-2 production than the pristine Bi2S3 under simulated solar light irradiation. This core-shell feature of C@Bi2S3 provides efficient charge separation and transfer owing to the formed heterojunction and a short radial transfer path, thus efficiently diminishing the charge recombination; it also facilitates plenty of active sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction owing to its mesoporous nature. These outcomes will open opportunities for developing low-cost and noble-metal-free efficient electrode materials for water splitting and supercapacitor applications.	[Vattikuti, S. V.

The influence of the synthesized organic compounds on the ionic and photovoltaic characteristics of the electrolytes was studied. In specific, the PEO/INdF/PMMA/ICVI2/PEP blend electrolyte exhibited high ionic conductivity of 6.3 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) and the corresponding DSSC demonstrated an enhanced conversion efficiency of 9%. The high photovoltaic conversion efficiency of the cell with the PEP-doped system can be attributed to the higher conductivities in the polymer electrolyte associated with the greater cross-linking and the increased I-/I-3(-) transportation along the interaction of the tetra ethylene glycol derivative, salt and the polymer matrix.

To fabricate thin c-Si FPVs, it is important to improve their light-absorption properties while maintaining the flexible characteristics. In this study, vertically aligned microwires (MWs) on a 50 m-thick thin c-Si substrate are designed for novel FPVs. Increasing the length of the MWs enhances the optical properties of the thin c-Si without affecting its flexibility. To maximize the efficiency of the thin c-Si FPVs with MWs, tapered MWs and a localized back-contact structure are devised. This device shows a maximum efficiency of 18.9%. In addition, the proposed thin c-Si FPV with MWs shows high stability without any change in efficiency, even with 1000 bending cycles with a bending radius of 12 mm. Thus, we successfully demonstrate battery-free flexible electronic devices integrated with our thin c-Si FPVs with MWs.

J	Song, S; Kim, H; Chang, YK				Song, Sua; Kim, Hongrae; Chang, Young-Keun			Design and Implementation of 3U CubeSat Platform Architecture	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING			English	Article								This paper describes the main concept and development of a standard platform architecture of 3U Cube Satellite, whose design and performance were implemented and verified through the development of KAUSAT-5 3U CubeSat. The 3U standard platform is built in 1.5U size and developed as a modular concept to add and expand payloads and attitude control actuators to meet the user's needs. In the case of the electrical power system, the solar panel, the battery, and the deployment mechanism are designed to be configured by the user. Mechanical system design maximizes the electrical capability to accommodate various payloads and to integrate and miniaturize EEE (Electrical, Electronic, and Electromechanical) parts and subsystem functions/performance into limited-size PCBs. The performance of KAUSAT-5 adopting standard platform was verified by mounting the VSCMG (Variable Speed Control Moment Gyro), which is one payload for technical demonstration, at the bottom of the platform and the infrared (IR) camera, which is the other payload for science mission, on the top. The 3U CubeSat equipped with the electronic optical camera is under development implementing the standard platform to reduce development cost and schedule by minimizing additional verification.

J	Bak, Y; Lee, JS; Lee, KB				Bak, Yeongsu; Lee, June-Seok; Lee, Kyo-Beum			Low-Voltage Ride-Through Control Strategy for a Grid-Connected Energy Storage System	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						low voltage ride through; wind power generation system; solar energy generation system; grid-connected; energy storage system	WIND TURBINES; PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEMS; CHARGE ESTIMATION; BATTERY STORAGE; POWER; GENERATION; OPERATION; MODEL; STATE; REQUIREMENTS	This paper presents a low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) control strategy for grid-connected energy storage systems (ESSs). In the past, researchers have investigated the LVRT control strategies to apply them to wind power generation (WPG) and solar energy generation (SEG) systems. Regardless of the energy source, the main purpose of the LVRT control strategies is to inject reactive power into the grid depending on the grid-code regulations using the grid-side inverter; the proposed LVRT control strategy for grid-connected ESSs also has the same purpose. However, unlike the WPG and SEG systems having unidirectional power flow, grid-connected ESSs have a bidirectional power flow. Therefore, the charging condition of the grid-connected ESSs should be considered for the LVRT control strategy. The proposed LVRT control strategy for grid-connected ESSs determines the injection quantity of the active and reactive currents, and the strategy depends on the voltage drop ratio of the three-phase grid. Additionally, in this paper, we analyzed the variations of the point of common coupling (PCC) voltage depending on the phase of the reactive current during the charging and discharging conditions. The validity of the proposed LVRT control strategy is verified and the variations of the PCC voltage of the grid-connected ESS are analyzed by simulation and experimental results.
