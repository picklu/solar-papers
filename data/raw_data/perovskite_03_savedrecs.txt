However, the lack of a robust method for producing quantum dots with controlled size and high ensemble uniformity has been one of the major obstacles in exploring the useful properties of excitons in zero-dimensional nanostructures of CsPbX3. Here, we report a new synthesis approach that enables the precise control of the size based on the equilibrium rather than kinetics, producing CsPbX3 quantum dots nearly free of heterogeneous broadening in their exciton luminescence. The high level of size control and ensemble uniformity achieved here will open the door to harnessing the benefits of excitons in CsPbX3 quantum dots for photonic and energy-harvesting applications.

However, the performance of 1.80-1.85 eV E-g perovskite solar cells (PVKSCs) are significantly lagging their counterparts in the 1.60-1.75 eV E-g range. This is because the photovoltage (V-oc) does not proportionally increase with E-g due to lower optoelectronic quality of conventional (MA,FA,Cs)Pb(I,Br)(3) and results in a photovoltage plateau (V(oc )limited to 80% of the theoretical limit for similar to 1.8 eV E-g). Here, we incorporate phenyl-ethylammonium (PEA) in a mixed-halide perovskite composition to solve the inherent material-level challenges in 1.80-1.85 eV E-g perovskites. The amount of PEA incorporation governs the topography and optoelectronic properties of resultant films. Detailed structural and spectroscopic characterization reveal the characteristic trends in crystalline size, orientation, and charge carrier recombination dynamics and rationalize the origin of improved material quality with higher luminescence. With careful interface optimization, the improved material characteristics were translated to devices and V-oc values of 1.30-1.35 V were achieved, which correspond to 85-87% of the theoretical limit. Using an optimal amount of PEA incorporation to balance the increase in V-oc and the decrease in charge collection, a highest power conversion efficiency of 12.2% was realized. Our results clearly overcome the photovoltage plateau in the 1.80-1.85 eV E-g range and represent the highest V-oc achieved for mixed-halide PVKSCs. This study provides widely translatable insights, an important breakthrough, and a promising platform for next-generation perovskite tandems.

J	Snaith, HJ; Hacke, P				Snaith, Henry J.; Hacke, Peter			Enabling reliability assessments of pre-commercial perovskite photovoltaics with lessons learned from industrial standards	NATURE ENERGY			English	Review							SOLAR-CELLS; INDUCED DEGRADATION; STABILITY; MODULES; TEMPERATURE; PERFORMANCE; TANDEM	Photovoltaic modules are expected to operate in the field for more than 25 years, so reliability assessment is critical for the commercialization of new photovoltaic technologies. In early development stages, understanding and addressing the device degradation mechanisms are the priorities. However, any technology targeting large-scale deployment must eventually pass industry-standard qualification tests and undergo reliability testing to validate the module lifetime. In this Perspective, we review the methodologies used to assess the reliability of established photovoltaics technologies and to develop standardized qualification tests. We present the stress factors and stress levels for degradation mechanisms currently identified in pre-commercial perovskite devices, along with engineering concepts for mitigation of those degradation modes. Recommendations for complete and transparent reporting of stability tests are given, to facilitate future inter-laboratory comparisons and to further the understanding of field-relevant degradation mechanisms, which will benefit the development of accelerated stress tests.

Hybrid perovskite films approaching the radiative limit with over 90% photoluminescence quantum efficiency	NATURE PHOTONICS			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; THIN-FILMS; BAND-GAP; RECOMBINATION; LUMINESCENCE; PASSIVATION; MOBILITIES; DIFFUSION; EMISSION	Reducing non-radiative recombination in semiconducting materials is a prerequisite for achieving the highest performance in light-emitting and photovoltaic applications. Here, we characterize both external and internal photoluminescence quantum efficiency and quasi-Fermi-level splitting of surface-treated hybrid perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) thin films. With respect to the material bandgap, these passivated films exhibit the highest quasi-Fermi-level splitting measured to date, reaching 97.1 +/- 0.7% of the radiative limit, approaching that of the highest performing GaAs solar cells. We confirm these values with independent measurements of internal photoluminescence quantum efficiency of 91.9 +/- 2.7% under 1 Sun illumination intensity, setting a new benchmark for these materials. These results suggest hybrid perovskite solar cells are inherently capable of further increases in power conversion efficiency if surface passivation can be combined with optimized charge carrier selective interfaces.

Different concentrations of PCBM were studied in this paper. When a low concentration (5 mg/ml, 10 mg/ml or 15 mg/ml)of PCBM was used, the PCBM-CH3NH3PbI3 transition layer provided efficient electron collection. With the increase of the concentration of PCBM, a thicker PCBM layer was formed in the bulk heterojunction. Such a thick PCBM resulted in rough perovskite morphology and low photo-carrier collection efficiency. SEM images and metallographic microscope images confirmed that the PCBM upper layer gradually covered grain boundaries of perovskite films with the increase of the PCBM concentration. On the other hand, low concentrations of PCBM improved the light absorption and crystallinity of CH3NH3PbI3 films. The PCBM/perovskite heterojunction exhibited a high UV responsivity of 0.18 AW(-1) and a response time less than 123 ms. This research provides a way to improve the quality of perovskite films and the performance of perovskite photodetectors.

In PSCs of TiO2 NRs, the hysteresis of current density-voltage (J-V) curves is reduced significantly. The hysteresis index of PSCs of 670 nm long NRs is only 0.014. A difference in the charge accumulation at the TiO2-perovskite interface and the trapping site density is responsible for the smaller hysteresis of PSCs of TiO2 NRs. In PSCs of TiO2 NRs, mobile ions migrate longer and less electrons are trapped on the surface of TiO(2)NRs. This leads to a unique columnar space charge polarization at the TiO2-perovskite interface, which facilitates electron extraction and suppresses the hysteresis of J-V curve. Our study shows a new way to design the microstructure of the mesoporous TiO2 layer for hysteresis-free high performance perovskite solar cells.

Here, we demonstrate a highly-stable CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI(3)) perovskite using a green self-assembly (SA) process that provides a major breakthrough in resolving this issue. In this process, the hydrophobic polymer, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), is introduced into the 2D layered MAPbI(3) perovskite intermediates, resulting in chemical coordination and self-assembly into 3D perovskite grains with PMMA coated along the grain boundaries. The bilayer grain boundary effectively blocks moisture corrosion thereby significantly improving the stability of MAPbI(3) perovskite. Further, PMMA is found to reduce the trap density by electronically compensating the iodide vacancy along the boundary, which decreases the charge recombination and improves the open circuit voltage of PSCs. The PSCs comprising the MAPbI(3)-PMMA layer show excellent stability under high moisture conditions, exhibiting no phase change under approximate to 70% humidity for over 31 days (approximately 500% higher compared to state-of-the-art) and excellent performance in 50-70% humidity for over 50 days.

Photoinduced Migration of Ions in Optically Resonant Perovskite Nanoparticles	JETP LETTERS			English	Article							INDUCED PHASE SEGREGATION; SOLAR-CELLS; SILICON NANOPARTICLES; NANOSTRUCTURES; GENERATION; IMPACT; DRIVEN	Organic-inorganic perovskites with a mixed anion composition are widely used in solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and nanophotonic structures. Light nanosources based on resonant perovskite nanoparticles are of particular interest. However, perovskites with such a composition demonstrate the light-induced segregation of anions, which leads to a reversible dynamic rearrangement of the optical properties of a material and photoluminescence spectra. In this work, the photoinduced process of change in optical properties in resonant hybrid perovskite nanoparticles with a mixed anion composition (MAPbBr(1.5)I(1.5), where MA = NH3CH3+) has been studied. Comparison with a similar process in a perovskite thin film with a similar composition has shown that the photoinduced migration of halogen ions in a nanoparticle occurs cyclically. This is due to the competition of two processes: the concentration of ions near the boundaries of the particle and migration caused by the gradient of the density of light-generated electron-hole pairs. This effect in resonant nanoparticles makes it possible to obtain optically tunable nanoantennas.	[Gets, D. S.; Tiguntseva, E. Yu; Berestennikov, A. S.; Lyashenko, T. G.; Pushkarev, A.

Ultrathin Hole Extraction Layer for Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells	ACS OMEGA			English	Article							HALIDE PEROVSKITES; STABILITY; PERFORMANCE; ELECTRODES; DEPOSITION	Inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) incorporating poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT) as the hole transport/extraction layer have been broadly investigated in recent years. However, most PSCs which incorporate PEDOT as the hole transport layer (HTL) suffer from lower device performance stemming from reduced photocurrent and low open-circuit voltage around 0.95 V. Here, we report an ultrathin PEDOT layer as the HTL for efficient inverted structure PSCs. The transparency, conductivity, and resulting film morphology were studied and compared with traditional architectures and thicker PEDOT layers. The PSC device incorporating an ultrathin PEDOT layer shows significant improvement in short-circuit current density (J(SC)), open-circuit voltage (V-OC), and power conversion efficiency. Because ultrathin PEDOT layers can be easily obtained by dilution, this study suggests a simple way to improve the PSC performance and provide a route to further reduce the fabrication complexity and cost of PSCs.

However, the practical applications of perovskite-based PDs are still hindered by the material instability and relatively poor performance. In this paper, we report MA(0.7)FA(0.3)PbBr(3) PDs with double coating using poly(methyl methacrylate) and ZnO microparticles, which protects perovskite and enhances light scattering, respectively. With the double coating, the PDs show much improved performances with the responsivity and detectivity reaching 0.51 A W-1 and 4.0 x 10(12) Jones, respectively. Furthermore, the PDs show on/off ratio and linear dynamic range up to 10(5) and 100 dB, respectively. Our approach suggests a new route to fabricate efficient and stable perovskite-based PDs.

Controlling Thin-Film Stress and Wrinkling during Perovskite Film Formation	ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; EFFICIENCY; PERFORMANCE; SILICON; FABRICATION; EXTRACTION; MANAGEMENT; MORPHOLOGY; STABILITY; TRIHALIDE	Significant effort has focused on controlling the deposition of perovskite films to enable uniform films, enabling efficiencies to climb dramatically. However, little attention has been paid to the evolution of thin-film stresses during deposition and the consequent effect on film morphology. While a textured surface topology has potential benefits for light scattering, a smooth surface is desirable to enable the pinhole-free deposition of contact layers. We show that the highly textured morphology made by popular antisolvent conversion methods arises because of in-plane compressive stress experienced during the intermediate phase of film formation where the substrate constrains the film from expanding leading to energy release in the form of wrinkling, resulting in trenches that can be hundreds of nanometers deep with periods of several micrometers. We demonstrate that the extent of wrinkling is correlated with the rate of film conversion and that ultrasmooth films are obtained by slowing the rate of film formation.

Enhancing Defect Tolerance and Phase Stability of High-Bandgap Perovskites via Guanidinium Alloying	ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							TANDEM SOLAR-CELLS; MIXED-HALIDE PEROVSKITES; HYBRID PEROVSKITES; PHOTOVOLTAIC PERFORMANCE; SEGREGATION; CATIONS; LIGHT; METHYLAMMONIUM; LUMINESCENCE; SEPARATION	The open-circuit voltages (V-OC) of hybrid perovskite (HP) solar cells do not increase sufficiently with increasing bandgap (for Eg > 1.70eV). We study the impact of A(+) size mismatch induced lattice distortions (in ABX(3) structure) on the optoelectronic quality of high-bandgap HPs and find that the highest quality films have high A-site size-mismatch, where large guanidinium (GA) compensates for small Cs to keep the tolerance factor in the range for the perovskite structure. Specifically, we find that 1.84eV bandgap (FA(0.33)GA(0.19)Cs(0.47))Pb (I(0.66)Bro(0.34))(3) and 1.75eV bandgap (FA(0.58)GA(0.10)Cs(0.32))Pb(I(0.73)Bro(0.27))(3) attain quasi-Fermi level splitting of 1.43eV and 1.35eV, respectively, which is >91% of the Shockley-Queisser limit for both cases. Films of 1.75eV bandgap (FA,GA,Cs)Pb(I,Br)(3) are then used to fabricate p-i-n photovoltaic devices that have a V-OC of 1.24 V. This V-OC is among the highest V-OC reported for any HPs with similar bandgap (1.7 to 1.8 eV) and a substantial improvement for the p-i-n architecture, which is desirable for tandems with Si, CIGS, or a low-bandgap HP. Collectively, our results show that non-radiative recombination rates are reduced in (FA,GA,Cs)Pb(I,Br)(3) films and prove that FA-GA-Cs alloying is a viable route to attain high V-OC in high-bandgap HP solar cells.

J	Schulz, P				Schulz, Philip			Interface Design for Metal Halide Perovskite Solar Cells	ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							RECOMBINATION; SPECTROSCOPY; EFFICIENCY; DIFFUSION; VALENCE	With the rise of thin-film photovoltaics, the research community brought the interfaces within the device into the spotlight for performance enhancements. This Perspective lays out why this notion is especially applicable for solar cells based on metal halide perovskite (MHP) absorber materials, for which we reach a significant improvement of device functionality and stability through the means of engineering the energetics and electronic properties at the interface. After examining recent key developments in chemical and electronic structure characterization of MHPs that led to this avenue, we will iterate the next steps toward interlayer tailoring and analysis. The future goal is to derive a comprehensive model for interface energetics in perovskite solar cells and to set up respective design rules for stable high-efficiency cells. This approach also pertains to the broader scope of MHP-based optoelectronic devices for which charge carrier transport across the interfaces and surface recombination play a major role.

Here we employ transient absorption microscopy (TAM) to directly measure carrier transport within and across the boundaries in hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite thin films for solar cell applications with 50 nm spatial precision and 300 fs temporal resolution. By selectively imaging sub-bandgap states, our results show that lateral carrier transport is slowed down by these states at the grain boundaries. However, the long carrier lifetimes allow for efficient transport across the grain boundaries. The carrier diffusion constant is reduced by about a factor of 2 for micron-sized grain samples by the grain boundaries. For grain sizes on the order of 200 nm, carrier transport over multiple grains has been observed within a time window of 5 ns. These observations explain both the shortened photoluminescence lifetimes at the boundaries as well as the seemingly benign nature of the grain boundaries in carrier generation.

Most studies focused on the development of fused heterocycles as cores for HTMs. Nevertheless, nonfused heterocycles deserve to be studied since they can be easily synthesized. In this work, we reported a series of low-cost triphenylamine HTMs (M101-M106) with different nonfused cores. Results concluded that the introduced core has a significant influence on conductivity, hole mobility, energy level, and solubility of linear HTMs. M103 and M104 with nonfused oligothiophene cores are superior to other HTMs in terms of conductivity, hole mobility, and surface morphology. PSCs based on M104 exhibited the highest power conversion efficiency of 16.50% under AM 1.5 sun, which is comparable to that of spiro-OMeTAD (16.67%) under the same conditions. Importantly, the employment of M104 is highly economical in terms of the cost of synthesis as compared to that of spiro-OMeTAD. This work demonstrated that nonfused heterocycles, such as oligothiophene, are promising cores for high performance of linear HTMs toward PSCs.

Ruddlesden-Popper phase halide perovskites are two-dimensional solution-processed quantum wells and have recently emerged as highly efficient semiconductors for solar cell approaching 14% in power conversion efficiency. However, further improvements will require an understanding of the charge transport mechanisms, which are currently unknown and further complicated by the presence of strongly bound excitons. Here, we unambiguously determine that dominant photocurrent collection is through electric field-assisted electron-hole pair separation and transport across the potential barriers. This is revealed by in-depth device characterization, coupled with comprehensive device modeling, which can self-consistently reproduce our experimental findings. These findings establish the fundamental guidelines for the molecular and device design for layered 2D perovskite-based photovoltaics and optoelectronic devices, and are relevant for other similar quantum-confined systems.

However, how exactly the organic cations affect the structural phase transition and optoelectronic properties of the materials is not well understood. Here, real-time, in situ temperature-dependent neutron/X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence (PL) measurements reveal a transformation of the organic cation CH3NH3+ from order to disorder with increasing temperature in CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskites. The molecular-level order-todisorder transformation of CH3NH3+ not only leads to an anomalous increase in PL intensity, but also results in a multidomain to single-domain structural transition. This discovery establishes the important role that organic cation ordering has in dictating structural order and anomalous optoelectronic phenomenon in hybrid perovskites.

We report rapid annealed perovskite thin films using intense pulsed light (IPL) to initiate a radiative thermal response that is enabled by an alkyl halide additive that collectively improves the performance of a device processed in an ambient environment from a baseline of 10 to 16.5% efficiency. Previous reports on CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films using IPL processing achieved functional devices in milli-second time scales and are promising for high throughput manufacturing processes under ambient conditions. In this study, we found that the addition of diiodomethane (CH2I2) as an additive to the methylammonium iodide (MAI)/lead iodide (PbI2) precursor ink chemistry and subsequent IPL thermal annealing are inter-dependent. The concentration of CH2I2 and IPL processing parameters have a direct effect on the surface morphology of the films and performance within a perovskite solar cell (PSC). The CH2I2 dissociates under exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the IPL source liberating iodine ions in the film, influencing the perovskite formation and reducing the defect states. We anticipate that these results can be utilized to further develop different ink formulations using alkyl halides for the IPL technique to improve the performance of perovskite solar cells processed in ambient conditions.

Hot-Hole Cooling Controls the Initial Ultrafast Relaxation in Methylammonium Lead Iodide Perovskite	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL THEORY; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; HYBRID PEROVSKITES; PHONON BOTTLENECK; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; PYXAID PROGRAM; SOLAR-CELLS; TIME; RECOMBINATION; SIMULATIONS	Understanding the initial ultrafast excited state dynamics of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI) perovskite is of vital importance to enable its fullest utilisation in optoelectronic devices and the design of improved materials. Here we have combined advanced measurements of the ultrafast photoluminescence from MAPI films up to 0.6 eV above the relaxed excited state with cutting-edge advanced non-adiabatic quantum dynamics simulations, to provide a powerful unique insight into the earliest time behaviour in MAPI. Our joint experimental-theoretical approach highlights that the cooling of holes from deep in the valence band to the valence band edge is fast, occurring on a 100500 fs timescale. Cooling of electrons from high in the conduction band to the conduction band edge, however, is much slower, on the order of 1-10 ps. Density of states calculations indicate that excited states with holes deep in the valence band are greatly favoured upon photoexcitation, and this matches well with the fast (100-500 fs) formation time for the relaxed excited state observed in our ultrafast PL measurements. Consequently we are able to provide a complete observation of the initial excited state evolution in this important prototypical material.	[Hedley, Gordon J.; Harwell, Jonathon; Samuel, Ifor D.

Here, the RDP crystallization mechanism in real time from liquid precursors to the solid film is investigated, and how the phase transition kinetics influences phase purity, quantum well orientation, and photovoltaic performance is revealed. An important template-induced nucleation and growth of the desired (BA)(2)(MA)(3)Pb4I13 phase, which is achieved only via direct crystallization without formation of intermediate phases, is observed. As such, the thermodynamically preferred perpendicular crystal orientation and high phase purity are obtained. At low temperature, the formation of intermediate phases, including PbI2 crystals and solvate complexes, slows down intercalation of ions and increases nucleation barrier, leading to formation of multiple RDP phases and orientation randomness. These insights enable to obtain high quality (BA)(2)(MA)(3)Pb4I13 films with preferentially perpendicular quantum well orientation, high phase purity, smooth film surface, and improved optoelectronic properties. The resulting devices exhibit high power conversion efficiency of 12.17%. This work should help guide the perovskite community to better control Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite structure and further improve optoelectronic and solar cell devices.

We report photoluminescence (PL) spectra for cesium lead iodide (CsPbI3) perovskite nanocrystals under hydrostatic pressures up to 2.5 GPa. The peak position of the CsPbI3 PL shifts as a function of pressure. Initially, the PL shifts to lower energies, until a reversal occurs near 0.33 GPa. At higher pressures, the PL peak position shifts to the blue until PL vanishes above 2.5 GPa. We explain the pressure response with different modes of deformation of the perovskite crystal structure.

However, its incompatibility with formamidinium (FA)-based perovskites has impeded further enhancement of photovoltaic performance and stability. Here, we report an efficient and reproducible method to fabricate highly uniform FAPbI(3) films via the adduct approach. Replacement of the typical Lewis base dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) enabled the formation of a stable intermediate adduct phase, which can be converted into a uniform and pinhole-free FAPbI(3) film. Infrared and computational analyses revealed a stronger interaction between NMP with the FA cation than DMSO, which facilitates the formation of a stable FAI-PbI2 center dot NMP adduct. On the basis of the molecular interactions with different Lewis bases, we proposed criteria for selecting the Lewis bases. Owed to the high film quality, perovskite solar cells with the highest PCE over 20% (stabilized PCE of 19.34%) and average PCE of 18.83 +/- 0.73% were demonstrated.

A Versatile Thin-Film Deposition Method for Multidimensional Semiconducting Bismuth Halides	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							PEROVSKITE SOLAR-CELLS; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; LEAD TRIHALIDE; ELECTRON; LAYER; MOBILITIES; TRANSPORT; FORMAMIDINIUM; ABSORBERS; AGBI2I7	Despite the significant progress in fabricating hybrid organic-inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells, their toxicity and low stability remain as major drawbacks, thereby hindering large-scale commercialization. Given the isoelectronic nature of lead(II) and bismuth(III) ions, potentially stable and nontoxic alternatives for efficient light absorption in thin-film photovoltaic (PV) devices may be found among bismuth-based halide semiconductors. However, high-quality polycrystalline films of many of these systems have not been demonstrated. Here we present a versatile and facile two-step coevaporation approach to fabricate A(3)Bi(2)I(9) (A = Cs, Rb) and AgBi2I7 polycrystalline films with smooth, pinhole-free morphology and average grain size of >200 nm. The process involves an initial two-source evaporation step (involving CsI, RbI or AgI, and BiI3 sources), followed by an annealing step under BiI3 vapor. The structural, optical, and electrical characteristics of the resulting thin films are studied by X-ray diffraction, optical spectroscopy, X-ray/UV photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy.

Remarkable progress has been achieved in green perovskite LEDs in recent years, but not blue or red ones. Here, highly efficient and spectrally stable red perovskite LEDs with quasi-2D perovskite/poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) composite thin films as the light-emitting layer are reported. By controlling the molar ratios of organic salt (benzylammonium iodide) to inorganic salts (cesium iodide and lead iodide), luminescent quasi-2D perovskite thin films are obtained with tunable emission colors from red to deep red. The perovskite/polymer composite approach enables quasi-2D perovskite/PEO composite thin films to possess much higher photoluminescence quantum efficiencies and smoothness than their neat quasi-2D perovskite counterparts. Electrically driven LEDs with emissions peaked at 638, 664, 680, and 690 nm have been fabricated to exhibit high brightness and external quantum efficiencies (EQEs). For instance, the perovskite LED with an emission peaked at 680 nm exhibits a brightness of 1392 cd m(-2) and an EQE of 6.23%. Moreover, exceptional electroluminescence spectral stability under continuous device operation has been achieved for these red perovskite LEDs.

In this study, the authors report the utilization of cobalt (Co2+) to partially substitute lead (Pb2+) for developing novel hybrid perovskite materials, CH(3)NH(3)Pb(1-x)CoxI(3) (where x is nominal ratio, x = 0, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4). It is found that the novel perovskite thin films possess a cubic crystal structure with superior thin film morphology and larger grain size, which is significantly different from pristine thin film, which possesses the tetragonal crystal structure, with smaller grain size. Moreover, it is found that the 3d orbital of Co2+ ensures higher electron mobilities and electrical conductivities of the CH3NH3Pb1-xCoxI3 thin films than those of pristine CH3NH3Pb4 thin film. As a result, a power conversion efficiency of 21.43% is observed from perovskite solar cells fabricated by the CH3NH3Pb0.9Co0.1I3 thin film. Thus, the utilization of Co, partially substituting for Pb to tune physical properties of hybrid perovskite materials provides a facile way to boost device performance of perovskite solar cells.

However, the presence of toxic elements and chemical instability under an ambient atmosphere hindered lead halide perovskites from real device applications because of environmental issues and stability. Here, we demonstrate a resistive switching memory device based on a lead-free bismuth halide perovskite (CH3NH3)(3)Bi2I9 (MABI). The active layer of the device can be easily prepared by solvent engineering. The nonvolatile memory based on MABI layers has reliable retention properties (similar to 10(4) s), endurance (300 cycles), and switching speed (100 ns), as well as environmental stability. Moreover, the control of the compliance current leads to multilevel data storage with four resistance states, which can be applied to high-density memory devices. These results suggest that MABI has potential applications in information storage.

Herein, we studied the recombination and dissociation processes of photo-excited states in perovskite solar cells with different densities and depths of the trap states in the perovskite layer using magnetophoto-current measurements. The devices with lower density of traps show higher power conversion efficiency and negative magneto-photocurrent, whereas devices with higher density of deep traps exhibit lower power conversion efficiency and positive magneto-photocurrent. As the strong spin orbital coupling is induced by heavy atoms (Pb, I) in the perovskite materials, the original photo-excited spin-singlets (phi(mI)= +/- 1 phi up arrow e down arrow h) will transform into spin-triplets (phi(mI)= 0 phi up arrow e up arrow h) through intersystem crossing. In particular, the spin-triplets and trap states play an important role in photovoltaic actions of perovskite solar cells. Depending upon the depth of the traps, the spin-triplets can de-trap shallow charge carrier traps and subsequently contribute to the photocurrent in the perovskite solar cell, while the spin-triplets will be destroyed with the deep charge carrier traps, giving rise to non-radiative recombination in the perovskite solar cell. Our study elucidates the underlying mechanism, by which the spin configuration of photoexcited states, trap density and depth of traps impact the recombination and dissociation processes of the photo-excited states in perovskite solar cells based on the CH3NH3PbI3(Cl) system.

The crystal structure and bonding environment are consistent with CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots. The current-voltage (I-V) and capacitance-voltage (C-V) transport measurements indicate that the photo-carrier drift lifetime can exceed 1 ms for some printed perovskite films. This far exceeds the dark drift carrier lifetime, which is below 50 ns. The printed films show a photocarrier density 10(9) greater than the dark carrier density, making these printed films ideal candidates for application in photodetectors. The successful printing of photoactive-perovskite quantum dot films of CsPbBr3, indicates that the rapid prototyping of various perovskite inks and multilayers is realizable.	[Ilie, C.

However, the operation voltage of the resulting IR-to-visible up-conversion is large because of the series device architecture. Here, we report a low-voltage near-IR (NIR)-to-visible up-conversion device using formamidinium lead iodide as a NIR absorber integrated with a phosphorescent OLED. Because of the efficient photo carrier injection from the hybrid perovskite layer to the OLED, we observed a sub-band gap turn-on of the OLED under NIR illumination. The device showed a NIR-to-visible up-conversion efficiency of 3% and a luminance on/off ratio of 10(3) at only 5 V. Finally, we demonstrate pixel-free NIR imaging using the up-conversion device.

Processing Dependent Influence of the Hole Transport Layer Ionization Energy on Methylammonium Lead Iodide Perovskite Photovoltaics	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						organometal halide perovskite; photovoltaic; photoelectron spectroscopy; processing; hole transport layer	SENSITIZED SOLAR-CELLS; HIGHLY EFFICIENT; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; CH3NH3PBI3 PEROVSKITES; INVERSE-PHOTOEMISSION; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; STABILITY; DEGRADATION; MOBILITY; DERIVATIVES	Organometal halide perovskite photovoltaics typically contain both electron and hole transport layers, both of which influence charge extraction and recombination. The ionization energy (IE) of the hole transport layer (HTL) is one important material property that will influence the open-circuit voltage, fill factor, and short-circuit current. Herein, we introduce a new series of triarylaminoethynylsilanes with adjustable IEs as efficient HTL materials for methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)) perovskite based photovoltaics. The three triarylaminoethynylsilanes investigated can all be used as HTLs to yield PV performance on par with 2 the commonly used HTLs PEDOT:PSS and Spiro-OMeTAD in inverted architectures (i.e., HTL deposited prior to the perovskite layer). We further investigate the influence of the HTL IE on the photovoltaic performance of MAPbI(3) based inverted devices using two different MAPbI(3) processing methods with a series of 11 different HTL materials, with IEs ranging from 4.74 to 5.84 eV. The requirements for the HTL IE change based on whether MAPbI(3) is formed from lead acetate, Pb(OAc)(2), or PbI2 as the Pb source. The ideal HTL IE range is between 4.8 and 5.3 eV for MAPbI(3) processed from Pb(OAc)(2), while with PbI2 the PV performance is relatively insensitive to variations in the HTL IE between 4.8 and 5.8 eV. Our results suggest that contradictory findings in the literature on the effect of the HTL IE in perovskite photovoltaics stem partly from the different processing methods employed.

Yet, the mechanisms governing these unusual carrier dynamics are not completely understood. A leading hypothesis-disproved in this work-is that a large, static bulk Rashba effect slows down carrier recombination. Here, using second harmonic generation rotational anisotropy measurements on MAPbI(3) crystals, we demonstrate that the bulk structure of tetragonal MAPbI(3) is centrosymmetric with I-4/mcm space group. Our calculations show that a significant Rashba splitting in the bandstructure requires a non-centrosymmetric lead iodide framework, and that incorrect structural relaxations are responsible for the previously predicted large Rashba effect. The small Rashba splitting allows us to compute effective masses in excellent agreement with experiment. Our findings rule out the presence of a large static Rashba effect in bulk MAPbI(3), and our measurements find no evidence of dynamic Rashba effects.

Importance of Electronic Correlations and Unusual Excitonic Effects in Formamidinium Lead Halide Perovskites	PHYSICAL REVIEW X			English	Article							TANDEM SOLAR-CELLS; PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS; EFFECTIVE MASSES; SPECTRAL-WEIGHT; BINDING-ENERGY; PERFORMANCE; DEPOSITION; STABILITY; SYSTEMS; IODIDE	Hybrid inorganic-organic perovskites have recently attracted much interest because of both rich fundamental sciences and potential applications such as the primary energy-harvesting material in solar cells. However, an understanding of electronic and optical properties, particularly the complex dielectric function, of these materials is still lacking. Here, we report on the electronic and optical properties of selective perovskites using temperature-dependent spectroscopic ellipsometry, x-ray absorption spectroscopy supported by first-principles calculations. Surprisingly, the perovskite FA(0.85)Cs(0.15)Pbl(2.9)Br(0.1) has a very high density of low-energy excitons that increases with increasing temperature even at room temperature, which is not seen in any other material. This is found to be due to the strong, unscreened electron-electron and partially screened electron-hole interactions, which then tightly connect low- and high-energy bands caused by doping.

In this work, two new hole transport materials (HTMs), H16 and H18, have been obtained through a facile synthetic route by cross linking triarylamine-based donor groups with a 4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4H-dithieno[3,2-b: 2',3'-d]pyrrole (MPDTP) and N-(4-(4H-dithieno[3,2 b: 2',3'-d]pyrrol-4-yl) phenyl)-4-methoxy-N-(4-methoxyphenyl) aniline (TPDTP) unit, respectively. The H16 HTM outperforms the H18 in terms of conductivity, hole mobility, and hole transport at the interface. This result could be attributed to the enhancement of the conductivity, hole mobility and high quality of the film exerted by the MPDTP core. The optimized device based on H16 exhibits a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.16%, which is comparable to that obtained with the state-of-the-art-HTM spiro-OMeTAD (18.27%). Furthermore, the long-term aging test shows that the H16 based device has good stability after two months of aging under controlled (20%) humidity in the dark. Importantly, the synthesis cost of H16 is roughly 1/5 of that of spiro-OMeTAD. The present finding highlights the potential of DTP based HTMs for efficient PSCs.

Remarkable long-term stability of nanoconfined metal-halide perovskite crystals against degradation and polymorph transitions	NANOSCALE			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; ROOM-TEMPERATURE; ORGANIC CATIONS; CUBIC PHASE; EFFICIENT; METHYLAMMONIUM; STATE; PERFORMANCE; CH3NH3PBI3	Metal-halide perovskites are promising candidates to advance optoelectronic devices but are known to suffer from rapid material degradation. Here we demonstrate that nanoconfinement is an effective strategy for the long-term stabilization of metal-halide perovskite MAPbI(3) crystals against humidity-induced degradation and temperature-induced polymorph transitions. Two-dimensional X-ray diffraction patterns of MAPbI(3) films reveal an unprecedented air-stability of up to 594 days in non-chemically modified, non-passivated MAPbI(3) films deposited on substrates imposing complete 2D confinement on the tens of nanometers length scale. Temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction analysis and optical spectroscopy further reveal the suppression of temperature-dependent phase transitions in nanoconfined MAPbI(3) crystals. Most notably, the high-temperature cubic phase of MAPbI(3), typically stable at temperatures above 327 K, remains present until a temperature of 170 K when the perovskite crystals are nanoconfined within the 100 nm diameter pores of anodized aluminum oxide templates. Photoluminescence mapping confirms that nanoconfined MAPbI(3) crystals exhibit spatial uniformity on the tens of microns length scale, suggesting that nanoconfinement is an effective strategy for the formation of high-quality, stable MAPbI(3) crystals across large areas.

Here, a newly developed time-dependent density functional theory-based theoretical formalism is taken advantage of. It treats electron-hole and electron-nuclei interactions on the same footing to assess the many-body excited states of MAPbI(3) perovskites in their pristine state and in the presence of point chemical defects. It is shown that lead and iodine vacancies yield deep trap states that can be healed by dynamic effects, namely rotation of the methylammonium cations in response to point charges, or through slight changes in chemical composition, namely by introducing a tiny amount of chlorine dopants in the defective MAPbI(3). The theoretical results are supported by photoluminescence experiments on MAPbI(3-m)Cl(m) and pave the way toward the design of defect-free perovskite materials with optoelectronic performance approaching the theoretical limits.

However, their practical applications are currently hampered by the challenges of realizing high performance and long-term stability simultaneously. Herein, the development of inverted PVSCs is reported based on low temperature solution-processed CuCrO2 nanocrystals as a hole-transporting layer (HTL), to replace the extensively studied NiOx counterpart due to its suitable electronic structure and charge carrier transporting properties. A approximate to 45 nm thick compact CuCrO2 layer is incorporated into an inverted planar configuration of indium tin oxides (ITO)/c-CuCrO2/perovskite/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag, to result in the high steady-state power conversion efficiency of 19.0% versus 17.1% for the typical low temperature solution-processed NiOx-based devices. More importantly, the optimized CuCrO2-based device exhibits a much enhanced photostability than the reference device due to the greater UV light-harvesting of the CuCrO2 layer, which can efficiently prevent the perovskite film from intense UV light exposure to avoid associated degradation. The results demonstrate the promising potential of CuCrO2 nanocrystals as an efficient HTL for realizing high-performance and photostable inverted PVSCs.

The Relationship between Chemical Flexibility and Nanoscale Charge Collection in Hybrid Halide Perovskites	ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS			English	Review						hybrid perovskites; mixed halides; nanoprobe X-ray fluorescence	X-RAY-FLUORESCENCE; ORGANIC-INORGANIC PEROVSKITES; LEAD IODIDE PEROVSKITES; SOLAR-CELLS; CHLORINE INCORPORATION; ENHANCED PERFORMANCE; ION SEGREGATION; HIGH-EFFICIENCY; TIN OXIDE; LIGHT	Hybrid organometal halide perovskites are known for their excellent optoelectronic functionality as well as their wide-ranging chemical flexibility. The composition of hybrid perovskite devices has trended toward increasing complexity as fine-tuned properties are pursued, including multielement mixing on the constituents A and B and halide sites. However, this tunability presents potential challenges for charge extraction in functional devices. Poor consistency and repeatability between devices may arise due to variations in composition and microstructure. Within a single device, spatial heterogeneity in composition and phase segregation may limit the device from achieving its performance potential. This review details how the nanoscale elemental distribution and charge collection in hybrid perovskite materials evolve as chemical complexity increases, highlighting recent results using nondestructive operando synchrotron-based X-ray nanoprobe techniques. The results reveal a strong link between local chemistry and charge collection that must be controlled to develop robust, high-performance hybrid perovskite materials for optoelectronic devices.

Hollow perovskites derive from three-dimensional (3D) AMX3 perovskites = methylammonium (MA), formamidinium (FA); M = Sn, Pb; X = CI, Br, I), where small molecules such as ethylenediammonium cations (en) can be incorporated as the dication without altering the structure dimensionality. We present in this work the inherent structural properties of the hollow perovskites and expand this class of materials to the Pb-based analogues. Through a combination of physical and spectroscopic methods (XRD, gas pycnometry, NMR, TGA, SEM/EDX), we have assigned the general formula (A)(1-x)(en)(x)(M)(1-0.7x)(X)(3-0.4x) to the hollow perovskites. The incorporation of en in the 3D perovskite structure leads to massive M and X vacancies in the 3D [MX3] framework, thus the term hollow. The resulting materials are semiconductors with significantly blue-shifted direct band gaps from 1.25 to 1.51 eV for Sn-based perovskites and from 1.53 to 2.1 eV for the Pb-based analogues. The increased structural disorder and hollow nature were validated by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis as well as pair distribution function (PDF) analysis. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the experimental trends and suggest that the observed widening of the band gap is attributed to the massive M and X vacancies, which create a less connected 3D hollow structure. The resulting materials have superior air stability, where in the case of Sn-based hollow perovskites it exceeds two orders of temporal magnitude compared to the conventional full perovskites of MASnI(3) and FASnI(3). The hollow perovskite compounds pose as a new platform of promising light absorbers that can be utilized in single junction or tandem solar cells.

Herein, we used 1,8-octanedithiol as an effective additive in the [HC-(NH2)(2)](0.95)CS0.05PbI3 (FA(0.95)Cs(0.05)PbI(3)) solution to improve the FA(0.95)Cs(0.05)PbI(3) film quality via solution processing. 1,8-Octanedithiol would coordinate with lead to form the chelate-Pb compound, leading to smaller Gibbs free energy during the perovskite crystallization process, facilitating formation of high-quality perovskite films with larger grains, smoother surfaces, lower electron trap densities, and longer carrier lifetimes compared to the nonadditive ones. As a result, the champion efficiency for devices with 3% 1,8-octanedithiol-doped FA(0.95)Cs(0.05)PbI(3) is raised to 19.36% from 18.39% of a device without the additive. The new technique is a promising way to fabricate perovskite photovoltaics with high performance.

Scalable Deposition of High-Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells by Spray-Coating	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						perovskite solar cell; solution processing; ultrasonic spraying; scalable atmospheric deposition; wide processing window ink	THIN-FILMS; CRYSTALLIZATION; EXTRACTION	Spray-deposition is a low-cost, roll-to-roll compatible technique that could potentially replace spin-coating for the deposition of highly efficient perovskite solar cells. Here, perovskite active layers were fabricated in air using an ultrasonic spray system and compared with equivalent spin-coated films. A chlorine-containing perovskite ink with a wide processing window coupled with an antisolvent extraction resulted in perovskite films with relatively rougher surfaces than those spin-coated. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.3% was achieved with an average of 16.3% from 24 devices. Despite observing differences in film roughness and structure, the performance of sprayed perovskite solar cells was comparable to that of the spin coated cells processed in an inert atmosphere, showing the versatility of perovskite processing.

In this work, we incorporated the YVO4:Eu-3(+), Bi-3(+) luminescent down-shifting (LDS) material into the mesoporous TiO2. The YVO4:Eu-3(+), Bi-3(+) would convert the high UV photons into the low energy visible photons (red light) and improve the utilization of UV light in PSCs, which results in PCE enhancement and UV light stability improvement in PSCs. By controlling the YVO4:Eu-3(+), Bi-3(+) concentrations, an optimized PCE of 17.9% is obtained, which shows an improvement of 9.8% compared with the bare device. More importantly, the device based on the m-TiO2/YVO4:Eu-3(+), Bi-3(+) layer has distinguished stability under UV light irradiation, which could maintain 70% initial efficiency after 60 h of UV irradiation.

The HTMs were tested in mixed cation/anion perovskite solar cells (PSCs) of the composition [(FAPbI(3))(0.85)(MAPbBr(3))(0.15)]. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.17% under 100 Mw cm(-2) standard AM 1.SG solar illumination was obtained using Z30. Importantly, the devices based on Z30 show better stability compared to those using Z28 and Z29 when aged under ambient air of 40% relative humidity in the dark for 1008 h and under continuous sunlight soaking without encapsulation for 600 h. These results indicate that the 4,4-dimethoxytriphenylamine is a promising peripheral group in combination with the phenothiazine core, providing an alternative to develop small molecular HTMs for efficient and stable PSCs.

Further, devices based on large area single crystal membranes have shown increasing promise for photoelectronic applications. However, growing inch-scale quasi-2D perovskite single crystal membranes (quasi-2D PSCMs) has been fundamentally challenging. Here we report a fast synthetic method for synthesizing inch-scale quasi-2D PSCMs, namely (C4H9NH3)(n)(CH3NH3)(n-1)PbnI3n+1 (index n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and infinity), and demonstrate their application in a single-crystal photodetector. A quasi-2D PSCM has been grown at the water-air interface where spontaneous alignment of alkylammonium cations and high chemical potentials enable uniform orientation and fast in-plane growth. Structural, optical, and electrical characterizations have been conducted as a function of quantum well thickness, which is determined by the index n. It is shown that the photodetector based on the quasi-2D PSCM with the smallest quantum well thickness (n = 1) exhibits a strikingly low dark current of similar to 10(-13) A, higher on/off ratio of similar to 10(4), and faster response time in comparison to those of photodetectors based on quasi-2D PSCMs with larger quantum well thickness (n > 1). Our study paves the way toward the merging the gap between single crystal devices and the emerging quasi-2D perovskite materials.

By modifying the spin coating speed and PbI2/N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution concentration, the thickness of perovskite absorber layer was optimized to obtain high-performance solar cells. Using a PbI2/DMF solution of 1.3 mol/L, maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a perovskite solar cell is 15.5% with a perovskite film of 413nm at 5000 rpm, and PCE of 14.3% was also obtained for a solar cell with a perovskite film of 182 nm thick. It is derived that higher concentration of PbI2/DMF will result in better perovskite solar cells. Additionally, these perovskite solar cells are highly uniform.

Defect perovskites also have exceptional structural flexibility and diverse crystal chemistry, and thus, display potentials as host phases for incorporating high amounts of halides such as iodine and chorine. In this study, pure Cs2SnCl6, a lead-free defect perovskite variant, was synthesized through a solution-based route that produced particles ranging from 200 to 500nm. The thermal stability of the as-synthesized Cs2SnCl6 powders was investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), demonstrating stability up to 615 degrees C, above which a phase decomposition occurs leading to the loss of constituent component of SnCl4. Consolidation of Cs2SnCl6 into dense pellets (94% theoretical density) was achieved via spark plasma sintering (SPS) at a low sintering temperature of 350 degrees C. X-ray diffraction confirms no phase decomposition in the SPS-densified perovskite pellets as a result of rapid consolidation of the SPS sintering at a short duration and lower temperature, and the TGA analysis suggest a comparable thermal stability up to 627 degrees C for the densified pellet, slightly better than the as-synthesized powders. The thermal diffusivity of Cs2SnCl6 at room temperature was determined as 0.388mm2s(-1) by laser flash measurement. This work further discussed the potential applications of the SPS-densified Cs2SnCl6 beyond perovskite photovoltaics, introducing potential nuclear separations and waste forms for chlorine.

The perovskite materials show various advantages such as long carrier diffusion lengths, widely-tunable band gap with great light absorption potential. The low-cost fabrication techniques together with the high efficiency makes PSCs comparable with Si-based solar cells. But the drawbacks such as device instability, J-V hysteresis and lead toxicity reduce the further improvement and the future commercialization of PSCs. This review begins with the discussion of crystal and electronic structures of perovskite based on recent research findings. An evolution of PSCs is also analyzed with a greater detail of each component, device structures, major device fabrication methods and the performance of PSCs acquired by each method. The following part of this review is the discussion of major barriers on the pathway for the commercialization of PSCs. The effects of crystal structure, fabrication temperature, moisture, oxygen and UV towards the stability of PSCs are discussed. The stability of other components in the PSCs are also discussed. The lead toxicity and updated research progress on lead replacement are reviewed to understand the sustainability issues of PSCs. The origin of J-V hysteresis is also briefly discussed. Finally, this review provides a roadmap on the current needs and future research directions to address the main issues of PSCs.

However, the physics of thermal transport in MHP nanowires is still elusive even though it is highly relevant to the device thermal stability and optoelectronic performance. Through combined experimental measurements and theoretical analyses, here we disclose the underlying mechanisms governing thermal transport in three different kinds of lead halide perovskite nanowires (CH3NH3PbI3, CH3NH3PbBr3 and CsPbBr3). It is shown that the thermal conductivity of CH3NH3PbBr3 nanowires is significantly suppressed as compared to that of CsPbBr3 nanowires, which is attributed to the cation dynamic disorder. Furthermore, we observed different temperature-dependent thermal conductivities of hybrid perovskites CH3NH3PbBr3 and CH3NH3PbI3, which can be attributed to accelerated cation dynamics in CH3NH3PbBr3 at low temperature and the combined effects of lower phonon group velocity and higher Umklapp scattering rate in CH3NH3PbI3 at high temperature. These data and understanding should shed light on the design of high-performance MHP based thermal and optoelectronic devices.

The efficiency of the semitransparent colors was improved by impedance matching, which was enabled by placing a dielectric functional layer on top of traditional optical microcavities, with negligible influence on color pureness. The vast majority of the visible part of solar radiation is efficiently utilized for solar energy harvesting, achieving 10.47%, 10.66%, and 11.18% of efficiency for red, green, and blue (RGB) colored solar cells, respectively, while a very small proportion of the visible solar spectrum is used for structural coloration that can be readily tuned by altering the cavity medium thickness. The approach described herein can be suitable for a variety of applications such as display systems with ultra-low power consumption, highly efficient colorful solar panels, low-power wearable electronics, and energy-efficient optoelectronics.

Although organic semiconductors with high gain have been reported previously, a significant challenge remains in using them for electrically pumped lasers due to their low carrier mobility. Recently, hybrid halide perovskites have been reported to possess high carrier mobility and optical gain which allows them to be used for various optoelectronic applications. To explore the feasibility of using them as possible candidates for electrically pumped lasers, tin (Sn)-based perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with all-inorganic heterostructure are fabricated by the vapor-deposition process. The all-inorganic hetero-structured PeLEDs exhibited a maximum EQE of approximate to 0.34%, and withstood current density up to 915Acm(-2) with small emission zone of 0.01mm(2). In addition, by vacuum vapor deposition, extremely smooth and uniform cesium tin halide perovskite films with small grain size (approximate to 60nm) are obtained, in which low threshold (approximate to 7 mu Jcm(-2)) of their amplified spontaneous emission was presented. These characteristics demonstrate the great potential of using them as gain media for electrically pumped lasers.

The formation energy of the system increases with the increase in the doping concentration. When the doping concentration reaches 5%, it can be easily found that the valence band shifts toward high energy levels and the Fermi energy enters the valence band, and this indicates that MAPb(0.95)Ag(0.05)I(3) has a p-type conductive behavior. The optical band gap of MAPbI(3) is about 1.56 eV and the optical band gap increase of MAPb(1-x)Ag(x)I(3) is about 3.11 eV with Ag doping concentrations from 5% to 30%.

Here, we show that introducing a thin interlayer of poly(4-vinylpyridine) (PVP) between the perovskite film and the hole transport layer reduces nonradiative recombination. Employing such a PVP interlayer, we reach an open-circuit voltage of 1.20 V for the best devices and a stabilized efficiency of 20.7%. The beneficial effect of the PVP interlayer is proven by statistical analysis of various samples, many of those showing an open-circuit voltage larger than 1.17 V, and a 30 mV increase in average compared to unmodified samples. The reduced nonradiative recombination is proven by enhanced photo- and electroluminescence yields.

We investigate the solidification of MAPbI(3) films in situ during spin/blade-coating using optical and X-ray scattering methods. We find that the coating method and conditions profoundly influence the crystallization process, which proceeds through intermediate crystalline solvates. The polymorphism and composition of the solvates are mediated by the solvent removal rate dictated by the process temperature in blade-coating. Low to intermediate temperatures (25-80 degrees C) yield solvates with differing compositions and yield poor PCEs (similar to 5-8%) and a large spread (+/- 2.5%). The intermediate solvates are not observed at elevated temperatures (>100 degrees C), pointing to direct crystallization of the perovskite from the sol-gel ink. These conditions yield large and compact spherulitic domains of perovskite and improve the PCE to similar to 13-15% with a narrower spread (< +/- 0.5%), while coating at 150 degrees C yields 17.5% solar cells by inducing in situ decomposition of a small amount of MAPbI(3) into PbI2. The insights into the crystallization pathway highlight the current challenges and future opportunities associated with scaling up hybrid perovskite solar cell manufacturing.

Curtailing Perovskite Processing Limitations via Lamination at the Perovskite/Perovskite Interface	ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; IODIDE PEROVSKITE; FORMAMIDINIUM; DEGRADATION; TEMPERATURE; MORPHOLOGY; TOLERANCE; EMERGENCE; LAYERS	Standard layer-by-layer solution processing methods constrain lead-halide perovskite device architectures. The layer below the perovskite must be robust to the strong organic solvents used to form the perovskite while the layer above has a limited thermal budget and must be processed in nonpolar solvents to prevent perovskite degradation. To circumvent these limitations, we developed a procedure where two transparent conductive oxide/transport material/perovskite half stacks are independently fabricated and then laminated together at the perovskite/perovskite interface. Using ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy, external quantum efficiency, X-ray diffraction, and time-resolved photoluminesence spectroscopy, we show that this procedure improves photovoltaic properties of the perovskite layer. Applying this procedure, semitransparent devices employing two high-temperature oxide transport layers were fabricated, which realized an average efficiency of 9.6% (maximum: 10.6%) despite series resistance limitations from the substrate design. Overall, the developed lamination procedure curtails processing constraints, enables new device designs, and affords new opportunities for optimization.

We demonstrate ultrafast frequency-agile terahertz metamaterial devices that enable such a capability, in which multiple perovskites can be patterned in each unit cell with micrometer-scale precision. To accomplish this, we developed a fabrication technique that shields already deposited perovskites from organic solvents, allowing for multiple perovskites to be patterned in close proximity. By doing so, we demonstrate tuning of the terahertz resonant response that is based not only on the optical pump fluence but also on the optical wavelength. Because polycrystalline perovskites have subnanosecond photocarrier recombination lifetimes, switching between resonances can occur on an ultrafast time scale. The use of multiple perovskites allows for new functionalities that are not possible using a single semiconducting material. For example, by patterning one perovskite in the gaps of split-ring resonators and bringing a uniform thin film of a second perovskite in close proximity, we demonstrate tuning of the resonant response using one optical wavelength and suppression of the resonance using a different optical wavelength. This general approach offers new capabilities for creating tunable terahertz devices.

An additive dripping technique using diphenyl ether for tuning perovskite crystallization for high-efficiency solar cells	NANO RESEARCH			English	Article						perovskite solar cells; additive dripping; crystallinity; diphenyl ether (DPE)	HALIDE PEROVSKITE; PEDOT PSS; TEMPERATURE; PERFORMANCE; TRANSPORT; HYSTERESIS; CH3NH3PBI3; RECOMBINATION; MORPHOLOGY; DENSITY	Controlling the morphology of the MAPbI(3-x) Cl (x) active layer has remained a challenge towards advancing perovskite solar cells (PvSCs). Here, we demonstrate that a low temperature additive dripping (AD) treatment step, using diphenyl ether (DPE), can significantly improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE), compared to the control device using chlorobenzene (CB), by 15% up to 16.64%, with a high current density (J(SC)) of 22.67 mA/cm(2). We chose DPE for its small and appropriate dipole moment to adjust the solubility of the MAPbI(3-x) Cl (x) precursor during the formation of the intermediate phase and the MAPbI(3-x) Cl (x) phase. The low DPE vapor pressure provides a longer processing window for the removal of residual dimethylformamide (DMF), during the annealing process, for improved perovskite formation. Imaging and X-ray analysis both reveal that the MAPbI(3-x) Cl (x) film exhibits enlarged grains with increased crystallinity. Together, these improvements result in reduced carrier recombination and hole trap-state density in the MAPbI(3-x) Cl (x) film, while minimizing the hysteresis problem typical of PvSCs. These results show thatthe AD approach is a promising technique for improving PvSCs.

Here, by developing a vertically gated methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3))/indium-tin oxide (ITO) Schottky junction, a room temperature-operable vertical MAPbI(3) thin-film transistor is reported. Due to the injection-controlled gating mechanism as well as the vertical channel structure, a current modulation ratio up to 10(4) is achieved. Fabrication of a nanoporous ITO source electrode forming a highly rectifying Schottky junction with the MAPbI(3) layer is the key for the large current modulation. It is discovered that the electron transporting layers on top of the MAPbI(3) layer play an important role in achieving a large current rectification of 10(7) at the Schottky junction and hence large current on/off ratios of the resulting transistor.

Despite such an impressive development, some key scientific issues of these materials, including the presence of toxic lead, the poor long-term device stability under heat and humidity conditions, and the anomalous hysteresis of the current-voltage curves shown by various solar cell devices, still remain unsolved and constitute an important focus of experimental and theoretical researchers throughout the world. Density functional theory calculations have been successfully applied to exploring structural and electronic properties of semiconductors, complementing the experimental results in search and discovery of novel functional materials. In this review, we summarize the current progress in perovskite photovoltaic materials from a theoretical perspective.

Ionic liquid (IL), that forms dipoles pointing away from TiO2, can adjust the work function of TiO2 resulting in suitable energy level for charge transfer from CH3NH3PbBr3 to TiO2. The time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy (TRPL) measurements confirm faster electron transfer from the CH3NH3PbBr3 film to TiO2 after modification by IL.

J	Namkoong, G; Mamun, AA; Ava, TT				Namkoong, Gon; Mamun, Abdullah A.; Ava, Tanzila Tasnim			Impact of PCBM/C60 electron transfer layer on charge transports on ordered and disordered perovskite phases and hysteresis-free perovskite solar cells	ORGANIC ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Perovskites; Photoluminescence; Time-resolved emission spectra; Quenching study; Photocurrent hysteresis	HOLE-CONDUCTOR-FREE; PERFORMANCE; ENHANCEMENT; TEMPERATURE	For perovskite solar cells, thermal treatment of perovskite/PCBM layer is typically required for facilitated charge extraction, thereby eliminating the notorious photocurrent hysteresis. However, a simple manufacturing process without additional heat treatment is desirable for low-cost production. Remarkably, we observed an absence of photocurrent hysteresis of perovskite solar cell with as-deposited PCBM/C60 layer. To understand what caused hysteresis-free photocurrent behaviors, PL quenching studies were conducted using time-resolved lifetime decays and deconvoluted PL analysis. It is found that the perovskite/PCBM layer, which was not thermally treated after deposition, led to inefficient defect passivation of grain boundaries (GBs) and defective domains at the perovskite interface. This led to charge trapping and detrapping events at the perovskite/PCBM interface, which caused the photocurrent hysteresis behaviors. In contrast, it is found that C60 diffused from the PCBM/C60 layer effectively passivated the perovskite GBs even without thermal treatment, which facilitated the charge transfer through GBs to electrodes and eliminated the photocurrent hysteresis. Our result provides a more economical manufacturing process without heat treatment of perovskite/PCBM layer while achieving defect passivation and high charge extraction efficiency of perovskite solar cells.

Herein, for the first time, a solution-processed cobalt (Co)-doped NiOx film was fabricated as the hole transport layer in inverted planar PSCs, and the solar cells exhibit 18.6% power conversion efficiency. It has been found that an appropriate Co-doping can significantly adjust the work function and enhance electrical conductivity of the NiOx film. Capacitance voltage (C-V) spectra and time-resolved photoluminescence spectra indicate clearly that the charge accumulation becomes more pronounced in the Co-doped NiOx-based photovoltaic devices; it, as a consequence, prevents the nonradiative recombination at the interface between the Co-doped NiOX and the photoactive perovskite layers. Moreover, field-dependent photoluminescence measurements indicate that Co doped NiOX based devices can also effectively inhibit the radiative recombination process in the perovskite layer and finally facilitate the generation of photocurrent. Our work indicates that Co-doped NiOX film is an excellent candidate for high-performance inverted planar PSCs.

However, this remains challenging due to the expensive hole-transporting materials usually employed, and difficulties associated with the scalable deposition of other functional layers. By simplifying the device architecture, hole-transport-layer-free PSCs with improved photovoltaic performance are fabricated via a scalable doctor-blading process. Molecular doping of halide perovskite films improved the conductivity of the films and their electronic contact with the conductive substrate, resulting in a reduced series resistance. It facilitates the extraction of photoexcited holes from perovskite directly to the conductive substrate. The bladed hole-transport-layer-free PSCs showed a stabilized power conversion efficiency above 20.0%. This work represents a significant step towards the scalable, cost-effective manufacturing of PSCs with both high performance and simple fabrication processes.

Four spiro-OMeTAD recipes with controlled concentrations of additives are studied in the context of PSCs. It is found that a small change in the concentration of additives results in a huge difference in the overall power conversion efficiency, which stems from the distinct charge extraction process in PSCs. Furthermore, the effect of the third additive, a cobalt complex (FK102, Co(III)TFSI), on the carrier density and charge recombination in PSCs is extensively investigated. It is found that the presence of the cobalt additive can significantly improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs via the suppression of charge recombination at the interface of the perovskite layer and the HTM layer, which leads to a more than doubled power conversion efficiency.

Herein, we have demonstrated that when a hydrophobic organic acid molecule, 4-dimethylaminobenzoic acid, is introduced to modify the top surface of a CH3NH3PbI3 thin film, it is a facile way to simultaneously enhance the stability and efficiency of the corresponding PSCs. This surface modification can not only improve the perovskite film's electronic quality but also provide it with a certain waterproofing capability. Accordingly, the efficiency of the inverted PSC is improved from 17.43% to 19.87%. More encouragingly, after 1 sun light soaking, 85 degrees C thermal aging, and high humidity (70%) aging for 1000 hours, the modified CH3NH3PbI3 based PSCs can retain 91%, 81% and 98% efficiency, respectively.

Nevertheless, the nature of light-matter interaction in hybrid perovskites and the exact physical mechanism underlying device operation are currently debated. Here, we report room temperature, ultrafast photocurrent generation, and free-space terahertz emission from unbiased hybrid perovskites induced by femtosecond light pulses. The polarization dependence of the observed photoresponse is consistent with the bulk photovoltaic effect caused by a combination of injection and shift currents. Observation of this type of photocurrents sheds light on the low recombination and long carrier diffusion lengths arising from the indirect bandgap in CH3NH3PbI3. Naturally ballistic shift and injection photocurrents may enable third-generation perovskite solar cells with efficiency exceeding the Shockley-Queisser limit. The demonstrated control over photocurrents with light polarization also opens new venues toward perovskite spintronics and tunable THz devices.

The absorption onsets are dominated by bound excitons with sizable binding energies of a few hundred millielectronvolts and pronounced anisotropy. The spectra of both materials exhibit remarkable similarities, suggesting that the fingerprints of core excitations in MAPbI(3) are essentially given by its inorganic component, with negligible influence from the organic groups. The theoretical analysis complementing experimental observations provides the conceptual insights required for a full characterization of this complex material.

Halide Composition Controls Electron-Hole Recombination in Cesium-Lead Halide Perovskite Quantum Dots: A Time Domain Ab lnitio Study	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article							NONADIABATIC MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; ORGANIC-INORGANIC PEROVSKITES; CHARGE-CARRIER DYNAMICS; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; CH3NH3PBI3 PEROVSKITE; PYXAID PROGRAM; ANION-EXCHANGE; NANOCRYSTALS; INITIO; CSPBBR3	We demonstrate that halide content strongly affects nonradiative electron-hole recombination in all-inorganic perovskite quantum dots (QDs). Using time domain density functional theory and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, we show that replacing half of the bromines with iodines in a CsPbBr3 QD extends the charge carrier lifetime by a factor of 5, while complete replacement extends the lifetime by a factor of 8. Doping with iodines decreases the nonadiabatic charge-phonon coupling because iodines are heavier and slower than bromines and because the overlap between the electron and hole wave functions is reduced. In general, the nonradiative electron-hole recombination proceeds slowly, on a nanosecond time scale, due to small sub 1 meV nonadiabatic coupling and short sub-10 fs coherence times. The obtained recombination times and their dependence on the halogen content show excellent agreement with experiments. Our study suggests that the power conversion efficiencies of solar cells can be controlled by changing the halide composition in all-inorganic perovskite QDs.

Here, we report on the fabrication of self powered all-inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite MC PDs with high detectivity, using a modified solution synthesis method. The MCs are up to about 10 tem in size, and the MC layer is also about 11 mu m in thickness. Under 473 nm laser (100 mW) illumination, the CsPbBr3 MC PDs show responsivity values of up to 0.172 A W-1, detectivity values of up to 4.8 X 10(12) Jones, on/off ratios of up to 1.3 X 10(5), and linear dynamic ranges of up to 113 dB. These performances are significantly better than those of PDs based on polycrystalline perovskite thin films and comparable with those of PDs based on perovskite single crystals.

Light soaking leads to a transient increase of the photoluminescence efficiency at excitation wavelengths longer than 520 nm, whereas light-induced degradation occurs when exciting the films with wavelengths shorter than 520 nm. X-ray diffraction and extinction measurements reveal the light-induced decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3 to lead iodide (PbI2) for the high-energy excitation regime. We propose a model explaining the energy dependence of the photostability that involves the photoexcitation of residual PbI2 species in the perovskite triggering the decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3.

High-Sensitivity Light Detection via Gate Tuning of Organometallic Perovskite/PCBM Bulk Heterojunctions on Ferroelectric Pb0.92La0.08Zr0.52Ti0.48O3 Gated Graphene Field Effect Transistors	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						organometallic perovskite; ferroelectric gate; graphene field effect transistor; bulk heterojunction	SOLAR-CELLS; ULTRAHIGH GAIN; PHOTOTRANSISTORS; PHOTODETECTORS; CH3NH3PBI3; INTERFACE	Organometallic perovskite (OMP) CH3NH3PbI3 doped with [6,6]-phenyl-C-61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) has been shown to form bulk heterojunction (OMP-PCBM BHJ) for improved charge separation. In this work, the OMP-PCBM BHJ photosensitizer is combined with graphene field effect transistors (GFETs) with a ferroelectric Pb0.92La0.08Zr0.52Ti0.48O3 gate of high gating efficiency. A remarkable gate tunability via shifting the Fermi energy of graphene with respect to the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum of the OMP was observed, which is critical for facilitating efficient charge transfer across the OMP-PCBM BHJ/GFET interface. The combination of the high-efficiency charge separation by BHJ and charge transfer by high gate tunability leads to achievement of high photoresponsivity up to 7 x 10(6) A/W and detectivity exceeding 7 x 10(12) Jones at 550 nm at a small gate voltage of 1.0 V. These results represent almost 2 orders of magnitude improvement over that without a gate tuning under the similar experimental condition, illustrating the importance of the interface electronic structure in optimizing the optoelectronic performance of the OMP-PCBM BHJ/GFET devices.

Evidence of tunable macroscopic polarization in perovskite films using photo-Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy	MATERIALS LETTERS			English	Article						Perovskite; Kelvin Probe; Polarization; Charge carrier accumulation; Charge carrier transport	HIGHLY EFFICIENT; SOLAR-CELLS; EXTRACTION; ELECTRODES; DIFFUSION; TRANSPORT	Using photo-Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (photo-KPFM) we observed macroscopic, photo-induced polarization through 200 nm thick polycrystalline methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI(3)) perovskite films in MAPbI(3)/charge carrier transport material (CTM) bilayers. A polarization of up to similar to 600 mV was observed for some MAPbI(3)/CTM bilayers and the sign of polarization is dependent on the predominant charge carrier properties of the CTM used. We propose that through-film photo-KPFM polarization measurements can be useful in determining the efficacy of a CTM. Polarized perovskite films may also have applications as surfaces for performing electrochemical reactions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These nanocrystals adopted ordered-vacancy perovskite crystal structures and demonstrated composition-tunable optical properties. Growth occurred by initial formation of Bi0 seeds, and morphology was controlled by precursor and seed concentration. The Cs3Bi2I9 nanocrystals demonstrated excellent stability under ambient conditions for several months. Contrary to previous reports, we find that photoluminescence originates from the precursor material as opposed to the Cs3Bi2X9 nanocrystals.	[Nelson, R. D.; Wang, Y.; Hadi, A.; Panthani, M.

J	Zarick, HF; Soetan, N; Erwin, WR; Bardhan, R				Zarick, Holly F.; Soetan, Naiya; Erwin, William R.; Bardhan, Rizia			Mixed halide hybrid perovskites: a paradigm shift in photovoltaics	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Review							OPEN-CIRCUIT VOLTAGE; ULTRAFAST CARRIER DYNAMICS; SOLAR-CELLS; HIGHLY EFFICIENT; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; CH3NH3PBI3 PEROVSKITE; IMPROVED STABILITY; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; 2-STEP DEPOSITION; THIN-FILMS	Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have improved at an unprecedented rate, reaching over 22% power conversion efficiency in less than a decade, and have generated a wealth of high impact work in the literature studying the properties of these unique materials. While the highest performance and best progress have been observed with methylammonium lead triiodide perovskites, their low tolerance to moisture and rapid degradation when exposed to UV light and high temperatures have posed a major setback to their commercialization. Recently, mixed halide hybrid perovskites (MHHPs) where l(-) is substituted with Br- and Cl- have driven a paradigm shift in PSCs, synergistically combining high performance with high ambient stability. In this comprehensive review, we summarize the progress made in the past 5 years in methylammonium-based organic-inorganic MHHPs and cesium-based all inorganic MHHPs. We discuss the fabrication approaches for halide substitution and the resulting crystal structure, long-term stability and durability, and device performance. Unique from other reviews, we focus this review on the optical properties of MHHPs, including light-induced phase segregation and alterations in the optical band gap and photoluminescence with halide substitution. We also summarize trends in carrier dynamics, including carrier thermalization, recombination, and charge transfer probed with time-resolved optical spectroscopies. Furthermore, we provide a short overview on mixed cation hybrid perovskites, where methylammonium is substituted with formamidinium/cesium or Pb is substituted with less toxic and benign metals to improve both the stability and the environmental impact of PSCs. We discuss the optical characteristics of mixed cation perovskites and approaches to lower nonradiative recombination with cation substitution. We conclude this review with a discussion on innovative future directions that will propel research on MHHPs as a game changer in perovskite-based optoelectronics.

The poor stabilities of CH3NH3PbI3-based solar cells may not only be attributed to the organic molecules but also the halides themself, most of which exhibit intrinsic instability under moisture and light. As an alternative, the possibility of oxide perovskites for photovoltaic applications is explored here. The class of lead-free stable oxide double perovskites A(2)M(III)M(V)O-6 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba; M(III) = Sb3+ or Bi3+; M(V) = V5+, Nb5+, or Ta5+) is comprehensively explored with regard to their stability and their electronic and optical properties. Apart from the strong stability, this class of double perovskites exhibits direct bandgaps ranging from 0.3 to 3.8 eV. With proper B site alloying, the bandgap can be tuned within the range of 1.0-1.6 eV with optical absorptions as strong as CH3NH3PbI3, making them suitable for efficient single-junction thin-film solar cell application.

The formation energy of different perovskite phases, their relative stability, and structural and electronic properties were explored. The sensitivity of the calculations to the choice of the density functional was investigated, and the predictions were compared with experimental results. The outcome of this study is that Mg and Ba perovskites are unlikely to form in the cubic, tetragonal, or orthorhombic phases because they have positive formation energies. Although Ca and Sr perovskites have negative formation energies with respect to the metal-iodide precursors, they exhibit wide band gaps and high hygroscopicity, making these unlikely candidates for applications in photovoltaic devices. Our results suggest that the performance of a local density functional with a nonseparable gradient approximation (NGA) is similar to that of hybrid functionals in terms of band gap predictions, when M in CsMI3 is a p-block element (Pb, Sn, and Ge). However, local density functionals with NGA predictions for the band gap are similar to other local functionals with a generalized gradient approximation (PBE, PBEsol, and PBE-D3) and are worse than those of HSE06, when M is an s-block element (Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba).

J	Bechtel, JS; Van der Ven, A				Bechtel, Jonathon S.; Van der Ven, Anton			First-principles thermodynamics study of phase stability in inorganic halide perovskite solid solutions	PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS			English	Article							ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; ANION-EXCHANGE; SOLAR-CELLS; NANOCRYSTALS; TRANSITIONS; SEGREGATION; RECOMBINATION; SUBSTITUTION; EFFICIENT	Halide substitution gives rise to a tunable band gap as a function of composition in halide perovskite materials. However, photoinduced phase segregation, observed at room temperature in mixed halide APb(IxBr1-x)(3) systems, limits open circuit voltages and decreases photovoltaic device efficiencies. We investigate equilibrium phase stability of orthorhombic Pnma gamma-phase CsM(XxY1-x)(3) perovskites where M is Pb or Sn, and X and Y are Br, Cl, or I. Finite-temperature phase diagrams are constructed using a cluster expansion effective Hamiltonian parameterized from first-principles density-functional-theory calculations. Solid solution phases for CsM(IxBr1-x)(3) and CsM (BrxCl1-x)(3) are predicted to be stable well belowroom temperature while CsM(IxCl1-x)(3) systems have miscibility gaps that extend above 400 K. The height of the miscibility gap correlates with the difference in volume between end members. Also layered ground states are found on the convex hull at x = 2/3 for CsSnBr2Cl, CsPbI2Br, and CsPbBrCl2. The impact of these ground states on the finite temperature phase diagram is discussed in the context of the experimentally observed photoinduced phase segregation.

The Impact of Atmosphere on the Local Luminescence Properties of Metal Halide Perovskite Grains	ADVANCED MATERIALS			English	Article						microphotoluminescence; molecular adsorption; nonradiative decay; passivation; perovskite solar cells	SOLAR-CELLS; RECOMBINATION CENTERS; SINGLE-CRYSTALS; TRAP STATES; THIN-FILMS; AB-INITIO; CH3NH3PBI3; DEGRADATION; EFFICIENCY; OXYGEN	Metal halide perovskites are exceptional candidates for inexpensive yet high-performing optoelectronic devices. Nevertheless, polycrystalline perovskite films are still limited by nonradiative losses due to charge carrier trap states that can be affected by illumination. Here, in situ microphotoluminescence measurements are used to elucidate the impact of light-soaking individual methylammonium lead iodide grains in high-quality polycrystalline films while immersing them with different atmospheric environments. It is shown that emission from each grain depends sensitively on both the environment and the nature of the specific grain, i.e., whether it shows good (bright grain) or poor (dark grain) luminescence properties. It is found that the dark grains show substantial rises in emission, while the bright grain emission is steady when illuminated in the presence of oxygen and/or water molecules. The results are explained using density functional theory calculations, which reveal strong adsorption energies of the molecules to the perovskite surfaces. It is also found that oxygen molecules bind particularly strongly to surface iodide vacancies which, in the presence of photoexcited electrons, lead to efficient passivation of the carrier trap states that arise from these vacancies. The work reveals a unique insight into the nature of nonradiative decay and the impact of atmospheric passivation on the microscale properties of perovskite films.

Recent developments of truly stretchable thin film electronic and optoelectronic devices	NANOSCALE			English	Review							LIGHT-EMITTING-DIODES; FIELD-EFFECT TRANSISTORS; ORGANIC SOLAR-CELLS; CARBON NANOTUBE FILMS; NANOWIRE PERCOLATION NETWORK; TRANSPARENT CONDUCTIVE FILMS; HIGH-PERFORMANCE ELECTRONICS; MECHANICALLY ROBUST; SILVER NANOWIRES; HIGH-EFFICIENCY	Truly stretchable electronics, wherein all components themselves permit elastic deformation as the whole devices are stretched, exhibit unique advantages over other strategies, such as simple fabrication process, high integrity of entire components and intimate integration with curvilinear surfaces. In contrast to the stretchable devices using stretchable interconnectors to integrate with rigid active devices, truly stretchable devices are realized with or without intentionally employing structural engineering (e.g. buckling), and the whole device can be bent, twisted, or stretched to meet the demands for practical applications, which are beyond the capability of conventional flexible devices that can only bend or twist. Recently, great achievements have been made toward truly stretchable electronics. Here, the contribution of this review is an effort to provide a panoramic view of the latest progress concerning truly stretchable electronic devices, of which we give special emphasis to three kinds of thin film electronic and optoelectronic devices: (1) thin film transistors, (2) electroluminescent devices (including organic light-emitting diodes, light-emitting electrochemical cells and perovskite light-emitting diodes), and (3) photovoltaics (including organic photovoltaics and perovskite solar cells). We systematically discuss the device design and fabrication strategies, the origin of device stretchability and the relationship between the electrical and mechanical behaviors of the devices. We hope that this review provides a clear outlook of these attractive stretchable devices for a broad range of scientists and attracts more researchers to devote their time to this interesting research field in both industry and academia, thus encouraging more intelligent lifestyles for human beings in the coming future.

Energy transfer mechanisms in layered 2D perovskites	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							COHERENT MULTIDIMENSIONAL SPECTROSCOPY; LIGHT-EMITTING-DIODES; SOLAR-CELLS; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; DYNAMICS; SEMICONDUCTORS; RECOMBINATION; EFFICIENT; EXCITON; STATE	Two-dimensional (2D) perovskite quantum wells are generating broad scientific interest because of their potential for use in optoelectronic devices. Recently, it has been shown that layers of 2D perovskites can be grown in which the average thicknesses of the quantum wells increase from the back to the front of the film. This geometry carries implications for light harvesting applications because the bandgap of a quantum well decreases as its thickness increases. The general structural formula for the 2D perovskite systems under investigation in this work is (PEA)(2)(MA)(n - 1)[PbnI3n+1] (PEA = phenethyl ammonium, MA = methyl ammonium). Here, we examine two layered 2D perovskites with different distributions of quantum well thicknesses. Spectroscopic measurements and model calculations suggest that both systems funnel electronic excitations from the back to the front of the film through energy transfer mechanisms on the time scales of 100's of ps (i.e., energy transfer from thinner to thicker quantum wells). In addition, the model calculations demonstrate that the transient absorption spectra are composed of a progression of single exciton and biexciton resonances associated with the individual quantum wells. We find that exciton dissociation and/or charge transport dynamics make only minor contributions to the transient absorption spectra within the first 1 ns after photo-excitation. An analysis of the energy transfer kinetics indicates that the transitions occur primarily between quantum wells with values of n that differ by 1 because of the spectral overlap factor that governs the energy transfer rate. Two-dimensional transient absorption spectra reveal a pattern of resonances consistent with the dominance of sequential energy transfer dynamics. Published by AIP Publishing.

Origin of vertical orientation in two-dimensional metal halide perovskites and its effect on photovoltaic performance	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; LIGHT; CRYSTALLIZATION; ELECTRON; NOISE	Thin films based on two-dimensional metal halide perovskites have achieved exceptional performance and stability in numerous optoelectronic device applications. Simple solution processing of the 2D perovskite provides opportunities for manufacturing devices at drastically lower cost compared to current commercial technologies. A key to high device performance is to align the 2D perovskite layers, during the solution processing, vertical to the electrodes to achieve efficient charge transport. However, it is yet to be understood how the counter-intuitive vertical orientations of 2D perovskite layers on substrates can be obtained. Here we report a formation mechanism of such vertically orientated 2D perovskite in which the nucleation and growth arise from the liquid-air interface. As a consequence, choice of substrates can be liberal from polymers to metal oxides depending on targeted application. We also demonstrate control over the degree of preferential orientation of the 2D perovskite layers and its drastic impact on device performance.

Light-induced lattice expansion leads to high-efficiency perovskite solar cells	SCIENCE			English	Article							HALIDE PEROVSKITES; HYSTERESIS; MICROSTRUCTURE; PHOTOCURRENT; PHONONS	Light-induced structural dynamics plays a vital role in the physical properties, device performance, and stability of hybrid perovskite based optoelectronic devices. We report that continuous light illumination leads to a uniform lattice expansion in hybrid perovskite thin films, which is critical for obtaining high-efficiency photovoltaic devices. Correlated, in situ structural and device characterizations reveal that light-induced lattice expansion benefits the performances of a mixed-cation pure-halide planar device, boosting the power conversion efficiency from 18.5 to 20.5%.The lattice expansion leads to the relaxation of local lattice strain, which lowers the energetic barriers at the perovskite-contact interfaces, thus improving the open circuit voltage and fill factor. The light-induced lattice expansion did not compromise the stability of these high-efficiency photovoltaic devices under continuous operation at full-spectrum 1-sun (100 milliwatts per square centimeter) illumination for more than 1500 hours.

Simply pressing polyurethane stamps with hexagonal nanodot arrays on partially dried perovskite intermediate films can cause pressure-induced perovskite crystallization. This pressure-induced crystallization allows to prepare highly efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs) because the preferred-orientation and enlarged grains with low-angle grain boundaries in the perovskite films exhibit suppressed nonradiative recombination. Consequently, the photovoltaic response is dramatically improved by the uniaxial compression in both inverted-planar PSCs and normal PSCs, leading to power conversion efficiencies of 19.16%.

Herein, a facile yet effective two-step method, i.e., room-temperature colloidal synthesis and low-temperature removal of additive (thiourea), to control the carrier concentration of SnO2 quantum dot (QD) ESLs to achieve high-performance PSCs is developed. By optimizing the electron density of SnO2 QD ESLs, a champion stabilized power output of 20.32% for the planar PSCs using triple cation perovskite absorber and 19.73% for those using CH3NH3PbI3 absorber is achieved. The superior uniformity of low-temperature processed SnO2 QD ESLs also enables the fabrication of approximate to 19% efficiency PSCs with an aperture area of 1.0 cm(2) and 16.97% efficiency flexible device. The results demonstrate the promise of carrier-concentration-controlled SnO2 QD ESLs for fabricating stable, efficient, reproducible, large-scale, and flexible planar PSCs.

Patrick; Yablonovitch, Eli			Fundamental Efficiency Limit of Lead Iodide Perovskite Solar Cells	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article							HALIDE PEROVSKITES; RADIATIVE RECOMBINATION; THIN-FILMS; BANDGAP; YIELDS	Lead halide materials have seen a recent surge of interest from the photovoltaics community following the observation of surprisingly high photovoltaic performance, with optoelectronic properties similar to GaAs. This begs the question: What is the limit for the efficiency of these materials? It has been known that under 1-sun illumination the efficiency limit of crystalline silicon is similar to 29%, despite the Shockley-Queisser (SQ) limit for its bandgap being similar to 33%: the discrepancy is due to strong Auger recombination. In this article, we show that methyl ammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)) likewise has a larger than expected Auger coefficient. Auger nonradiative recombination decreases the theoretical external luminescence efficiency to similar to 95% at open-circuit conditions. The Auger penalty is much reduced at the operating point where the carrier density is less, producing an oddly high fill factor of similar to 90.4%. This compensates the Auger penalty and leads to a power conversion efficiency of 30.5%, close to ideal for the MAPbI(3) bandgap.	[Pazos-Outon, Luis M.; Xiao, T.

The electrical and optical properties of the NiO thin films are engineered using varied sputtering conditions. The localized states within bandgap owing to its crystal disorder and nonstoichiometric features affect the transmittance and the optical bandgap of the NiO thin films which in turn influences the J(sc) of the perovskite solar cells. In addition, the electrical properties of the NiO thin films can be also varied during sputtering condition affecting the concentration of nickel vacancies and the resulting hole concentration. The conductivity largely originates from the hole concentration relating to the density of states in the NiO thin films which influence the fill factor (FF) of the solar cells. The solar cells fabricated with the NiO thin films made at 4 Pa of deposition pressure show highest performance owing to excellent transmittance and wider bandgap along with moderate conductivity. With further optimization, the perovskite solar cells exhibit similar to 20 mA/cm(2) of J(sc) and a 12.4% PCE (11.3% of averaged PCE).

Orientation of Ferroelectric Domains and Disappearance upon Heating Methylammonium Lead Triiodide Perovskite from Tetragonal to Cubic Phase	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						ferroelectricity; perovskite; piezoresponse force microscopy; hysteresis loop; methylammonium lead triiodide; solar cells	PIEZORESPONSE FORCE MICROSCOPY; CHARGE SEPARATION; CH3NH3PBI3	We study the spontaneous polarization of the archetypal semiconducting halide perovskite methylammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3) that is currently being investigated for use in thin film solar cells and light-emitting diodes. Using both lateral and vertical piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) to image polycrystalline thin films, we observed domains in the piezoresponse that reversibly appear and disappear below and above the tetragonal-to-cubic phase transition temperature. Importantly, we observe these domains to exhibit a piezoresponse that is predominantly in-plane for films with the (110) plane oriented parallel to the substrate, providing a measure of the polarization associated with specific crystal planes. We characterize the polarization and its temporal response using both local switching spectroscopy and time-dependent PFM spectra. These data show hysteresis loops with the polarization switching with bias but relaxing back on time scales of several minutes. Our results suggest the existence of ferroelectric behavior due to off-center displacement of the Pb2+ cation, although the local polarization response is complicated by the presence of local ionic and electronic conductivity. Understanding the nature of these domains paves the way for further optimization of optoelectronic devices using CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite material.

Fundamental understanding of the photophysical and electronic properties of the 2D perovskites with pure single phase is essential for improving the performance of the optoelectronic devices and designing devices with new architectures. Investigating the optical and electronic properties of these materials with pure single phase is required to obtain pure single phase 2D perovskites. Here, we report on an alternative approach to fabricate (C4H9NH3)(2)(CH3NH3)(n-1)PbnI3n+1 microplates with pure single n-number perovskite phase for n > 2 by mechanical exfoliation. Micro-photoluminescence and absorption spectroscopy studies reveal that the as-synthesized 2D perovskite plates for n > 2 are comprised by dominant n-number phase and small inclusions of hybrid perovskite phases with different n values, which is supported by excitation power dependent photoluminescence. By mechanical exfoliation method, 2D perovskite microplates with the thickness of around 20 nm are obtained, which surprisingly have single n-number perovskite phase for n = 2-5. In addition, we have demonstrated that the exfoliated 2D perovskite microplates can be integrated with other 2D layered materials such as boron nitride, and are able to be transferred to prefabricated electrodes for photodetections. Our studies not only provide a strategy to prepare 2D perovskites with a single n-number perovskite phase allowing us to extract the basic optical and electronic parameters of pure phase perovskites, but also demonstrate the possibility to integrate the 2D perovskites with other 2D layered materials to extend the device's functionalities.

Here, we investigate Nb doping of SnO2 deposited by a low-cost, scalable chemical bath deposition (CBD) method. We study the effects of doping on compositional, structural, morphological, and device performance when these layers are employed as electron-selective layers (ESLs) in planar-structured PSCs. We use doping concentrations of 0, 1, 5, and 10 mol % Nb to Sn in solution. The ESLs were characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and ultraviolet visible spectroscopy. ESLs with an optimum 5 mol % Nb doping yielded, on average, an improvement of all the device photovoltaic parameters with a champion power conversion efficiency of 20.5% (20.1% stabilized).

Degradation of Highly Alloyed Metal Halide Perovskite Precursor Inks: Mechanism and Storage Solutions	ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; PHASE-TRANSITION; HYBRID; FORMAMIDINIUM; PHOTOVOLTAICS; SPECTRA	Whereas the promise of metal halide perovskite (MHP) photovoltaics (PV) is that they can combine high efficiency with solution-processability, the chemistry occurring in precursor inks is largely unexplored. Herein, we investigate the degradation of MHP solutions based on the most widely used solvents, dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). For the MHP inks studied, which contain formamidinium (FA(+)) methylammonium (MA(+)), cesium (Cs+), lead (Pb2+), bromide (Br-), and iodide (I-), dramatic compositional changes are observed following storage of the inks in nitrogen in the dark. We show that hydrolysis of DMF in the precursor solution forms dimethylammonium formate, which subsequently incorporates into the MHP film to compromise the ability of Cs+ and MA(+) to stabilize FA(+)-based MHP. The changes in solution chemistry lead to a modification of the perovskite film stoichiometry, band gap, and structure. The solid precursor salts are stable when ball-milled into a powder, allowing for the storage of large quantities of stoichiometric precursor materials.

Very recently, fully inorganic perovskite quantum dots also led to promising efficiencies, making them a potentially stable and efficient alternative to their hybrid cousins. Currently, the record efficiency is obtained with CsPbI3, whose crystallographical characterization is still limited. Here, we show through high-resolution in situ synchrotron XRD measurements that CsPbI3 can be undercooled below its transition temperature and temporarily maintained in its perovskite temperature, stabilizing a metastable perovskite polytype (black gamma-phase) crucial for photovoltaic applications. Our analysis of the structural phase transitions reveals a highly anisotropic evolution of the individual lattice parameters versus temperature. Structural, vibrational, and electronic properties of all the experimentally observed black phases are further inspected based on several theoretical approaches. Whereas the black gamma-phase is shown to behave harmonically around equilibrium, for the tetragonal phase, density functional theory reveals the same anharmonic behavior, with a Brillouin zone-centered double-well instability, as for the cubic phase. Using total energy and vibrational entropy calculations, we highlight the competition between all the low-temperature phases of CsPbI3 (gamma, delta, beta) and show that avoiding the order-disorder entropy term arising from double-well instabilities is key to preventing the formation of the yellow perovskitoid phase. A symmetry-based tight-binding model, validated by self-consistent GW calculations including spin-orbit coupling, affords further insight into their electronic properties, with evidence of Rashba effect for both cubic and tetragonal phases when using the symmetry-breaking structures obtained through frozen phonon calculations. structure down to room	[Marronnier, Arthur; Bonnassieux, Yvan] Univ Paris Saclay, CNRS, LPICM, Ecole Polytech, F-91128 Palaiseau, France; [Roma, Guido] Univ Paris Saclay, CEA, DEN Serv Rech Met Phys, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Boyer-Richard, Soline; Pedesseau, Laurent; Jancu, Jean-Marc; Even, Jacky] Jniv Rennes, INSA Rennes, CNRS, Inst FOTON,UMR 6082, F-35000 Rennes, France; [Katan, Claudine] Univ Rennes, UMR 6226, CNRS, INSA Rennes,ISCR,ENSCR, F-35000 Rennes, France; [Stoumpos, Constantinos C.; Kanatzidis, Mercouri G.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Chem, 2145 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Stoumpos, Constantinos C.; Kanatzidis, Mercouri G.] Northwestern Univ, Argonne Northwestern Solar Energy Res ANSER Ctr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA	Marronnier, A (reprint author), Univ Paris Saclay, CNRS, LPICM, Ecole Polytech, F-91128 Palaiseau, France.; Even, J (reprint author), Jniv Rennes, INSA Rennes, CNRS, Inst FOTON,UMR 6082, F-35000 Rennes, France.; Stoumpos, CC (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Chem, 2145 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.; Stoumpos, CC (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Argonne Northwestern Solar Energy Res ANSER Ctr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.	arthur.marronnier@polytechnique.edu; konstantinos.stoumpos@northwestern.edu; jacky.even@insa-rennes.fr	Pedesseau, Laurent/G-5198-2014; Stoumpos, Constantinos/P-6677-2016; Roma, Guido/C-9556-2009; Jacky, EVEN/C-6212-2008; Claudine, KATAN/I-9446-2012	Pedesseau, Laurent/0000-0001-9414-8644; Stoumpos, Constantinos/0000-0001-8396-9578; Jacky, EVEN/0000-0002-4607-3390; Claudine, KATAN/0000-0002-2017-5823; Marronnier, Arthur/0000-0003-0984-1140; Boyer-Richard, Soline/0000-0002-0880-0999	Graduate School of Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; French Department of Energy (MTES); European Union's Horizon program, through a FET Open research and innovation action [687008]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy SciencesUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC-0012541]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy SciencesUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC02-06CH11357]	The PhD project of A.M. is funded by the Graduate School of Ecole des Ponts ParisTech and the French Department of Energy (MTES).

However, neither the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) property nor the correlation between SERS and photo electronic properties for single-crystalline perovskites have ever been studied. Here, for the first time, we observed a 10(5) enhancement in SERS for 4-mercaptopyridine (MPY) adsorbed on a methylamine lead chlorine (MAPbCl(3)) single crystal. Compared to the Raman spectrum of bulk MPY molecules, the b(2) mode of the MPY molecule was selectively enhanced. This is attributed to the charge transfer (CT) resonance mechanism at the interface between the single crystal and the adsorbed molecules, which benefit from the Herzberg-Teller contribution. UV-vis spectra demonstrated that the modification with the MPY molecules leads to the formation of a new interfacial transition state, which matches the excitation laser photon energy and results in a CT resonance process under 532 nm laser excitation. The MPY-modified MAPbCl(3) single crystal was further applied to a photoelectronic device, and the device I-V curve was collected under 532 nm laser irradiation. The results indicate that the MPY-modified MAPbCl(3) shows a clear photoelectronic response to the 532 nm light. This study establishes a correlation between the CT resonance-enhanced Raman and the photoelectronic responses of perovskite materials and provides guidance for future molecule-sensitized perovskite photoelectronic device studies.

Originally, it is believed that they are exciton-based devices, similar to organic or dye-sensitized solar cells. However, the emergence of efficient planar devices as well as measurements of exciton binding energy in the range of 10-100 meV suggest that they may be free carrier-based. In this work, the free carrier model is confirmed by building graphene/perovskite Schottky barrier solar cells, analogous to conventional metal/semiconductor Schottky barrier solar cells. To address the challenges of building such devices, solution-processing techniques are extensively investigated for depositing perovskite films directly onto graphene in order to obtain an intimate contact between the graphene and perovskite. Interestingly, these graphene/perovskite Schottky barrier devices have reasonably good efficiencyup to 10.6%and short circuit current densities only slightly lower than control devices. Furthermore, devices with neither a hole transport layer nor an electron transport layers have power conversion efficiencies of up to 6%. These results provide convincing evidence supporting the free carrier model for methylammonium lead iodide perovskites and offer insights on potential alternative designs for perovskite solar cells.

The introduction of capping ligands can enhance photoluminescence (PL), reduce non-radiative recombination, and improve stability. Here, we report a facile synthesis of CH3NH3PbBr3 PNCs with strong and highly stable green PL using melamine (Mela) as a simple and low-cost capping ligand. The resulting CH3NH3PbBr3/Mela PNCs have cubic phase crystal structure with an average particle size of 5.29 +/- 0.06 nm. The optical absorption and PL of the CH3NH3PbBr3/Mela PNCs with narrow bandwidth can be tuned within the visible region, and the PL quantum yield (QY) reached 52.3% compared to 0.4% the pristine CH3NH3PbBr3 PNCs. A synergistic effect between NH3+ and the electron-rich nitrogen atoms together with p-p stacking capacity, likely contributes to enhance the PL by effectively passivating of the trap states of PNCs. Furthermore, melamine-capped PNCs show high stability in protic solvents as a result of the steric bulkiness of the triazine rings, owing to the planar structure together with hydrogen bonding of melamine, which prevents solvent molecules from reaching and reacting with the core of PNCs. This study demonstrates a simple and effective approach for stabilizing PNCs for potential applications such as solar cells and LEDs.

Current power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceed 22%. However, despite this, record PCEs are still far from their theoretical Shockley-Queisser limit of 31%. To increase these PCE values, there is a pressing need to understand, quantify and microscopically model charge recombination processes in full working devices. Here, we present a complete microscopic account of charge recombination processes in high efficiency (18-19% PCE) hybrid perovskite (mixed cation and methylammonium lead iodide) solar cells. We employ diffraction-limited optical measurements along with relevant kinetic modeling to establish, for the first time, local photoluminescence quantum yields, trap densities, trapping efficiencies, charge extraction efficiencies, quasi-Fermi-level splitting, and effective PCE estimates. Correlations between these spatially resolved parameters, in turn, allow us to conclude that intrinsic electron traps in the perovskite active layers limit the performance of these state-of-the-art hybrid perovskite solar cells.

Fabrication and Characterization of Perovskite Solar Cells: An Integrated Laboratory Experience	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						Upper-Division Undergraduate; Inorganic Chemistry; Hands-On Learning/Manipulatives; Collaborative/Cooperative Learning; Problem Solving/Decision Making; Materials Science; Physical Properties; Undergraduate Research; Laboratory Instruction	PERFORMANCE; CRYSTALLIZATION; GROWTH; IMPACT; FILMS	Perovskite solar cells have garnered exponential research interest due to their facile fabrication, solution processability, and low cost. However, there have been limited efforts to integrate this class of materials into the undergraduate laboratory curriculum. Therefore, we designed an integrated laboratory experiment in our upper-division integrated laboratory sequence to teach students about research procedures and tools used in physical, organic, inorganic, and materials chemistry. This laboratory sequence involves conversion of sunlight to electricity, which is one of the most challenging renewable energy issues we are facing as a society. In this work, upper-level undergraduates study four variables affecting the morphology and optical properties of perovskites: solvent treatment, percent of water added to a precursor mixture, cation substitution, and precursor temperature. To do so, students deposit uniform films of the material using spin-coating and annealing, and then probe the resulting film properties via scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, solid-state UV-vis spectroscopy, and current voltage measurements. Students are able to execute the simple experimental setups and critically interpret, and compare, their results. Further, students are asked to question and understand structure property relationships to arrive at a fuller understanding of the light-to-electricity conversion process. Importantly, this laboratory prepares students for cutting-edge inorganic and materials research topics.

These features make perovskite solar cells (PSCs) suitable for terawatt-scale energy production with low production costs and low capital expenditure. Demonstrations of performance comparable to that of other thin-film photovoltaics (PVs) and improvements in laboratory-scale cell stability have recently made scale up of this PV technology an intense area of research focus. Here, we review recent progress and challenges in scaling up PSCs and related efforts to enable the terawatt-scale manufacturing and deployment of this PV technology. We discuss common device and module architectures, scalable deposition methods and progress in the scalable deposition of perovskite and charge-transport layers. We also provide an overview of device and module stability, module-level characterization techniques and techno-economic analyses of perovskite PV modules.

Herein, dense and uniform perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) films are fabricated by combining hot-casting technique (HCT) and methylamine (CH3NH2) gas treatment (MGT) under ambient conditions with a relative humidity of about 60%. These high quality CH3NH3PbI3 films are further used to fabricate planar heterojunction (PHJ) PSCs with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM/Ag, showing a power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 14.2% with negligible hysteresis. More importantly, these PHJ-PSCs show excellent stability, and over 80% of their original efficiencies could be maintained even stored in air (humidity similar to 45%) for 20 days without encapsulation. Meanwhile, the PCE up to 13.6% could be achieved for PHJ-PSCs fully fabricated in air including electron transport layer PCBM. The researches provide an ease-of-fabrication method to fully fabricate highly efficient and stable PHJ-PSCs under ambient conditions with high humidity, which would potentially accelerate the commercialization of PHJ-PSCs.

Here, by using ab inito molecular dynamics and electronic structure calculations, we report a systematic study on the broadening density of states (DOS) deep in the valence bands that has been experimentally observed but absent in static calculations. We quantify the broadening DOS reduction from the cubic phase to lower-temperature tetragonal and orthorhombic phases and attribute observed effects to the molecular vibrations and the anharmonicity of iodine atoms motion. Specifically, the MA cations' vibrations are strongly linked to the moderate C-N stretch and CH3 bend, as well as the strong CH3 and NH3+ stretches. These results present a theoretical perspective on the structural dynamics in lead-halide perovskites which may be valuable for future studies toward desired functionalities in perovskite-based optoelectronic devices.

We have now successfully suppressed the halide ion exchange by capping CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 nanocrystals with PbSO4-oleate to create a nanostructure assembly that inhibits the exchange of anions. Absorption measurements show that the nanocrystal assemblies maintain their identity as either CsPbBr3 or CsPbI3 for several days. Furthermore, the effect of PbSO4-oleate capping on the excited state dynamics has also been elucidated. The effectiveness of PbSO4 oleate capping of lead halide perovskite nanocrystals offers new opportunities to overcome the challenges of halide ion exchange and aid toward the tandem design of perovskite light-harvesting assemblies.

The PSC can be fabricated by numerous techniques; however, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) for the two-step-processed PSC falls behind that of the one-step method. In this work, we investigate the effects of relative humidity (RH) and dry air flow on the lead iodide (PbI2) solution deposition process. We conclude that the quality of the PbI2 film is critical to the development of the perovskite film and the performance of the PSC device. Low RH and dry air flow used during the PbI2 spin coating procedure can increase supersaturation concentration to form denser PbI2 nuclei and a more suitable PbI2 film. Moreover, airflow-assisted PbI2 drying and thermal annealing steps can smooth transformation from the nucleation stage to the crystallization stage.

The present work incorporates chemically modified graphene into nanocrystal SnO2 as the electron transporting layer (ETL) for highly efficient planar perovskite solar cells. The modification of SnO2 with highly conductive two-dimensional naphthalene diimide-graphene can increase surface hydrophobicity and form van der Waals interaction between the surfactant and the organic-inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskite compounds. As a result, highly efficient perovskite solar cells with power conversion efficiency of 20.2% can be achieved with an improved fill factor of 82%, which could be mainly attributed to the augmented charge extraction and transport.

Recently, two-dimensional (2D) perovskites are synthesized by isolating metal halide perovskite layers using aliphatic or aromatic alkylammonium spacer cation, which can retain their performance under ambient humidity levels due to the hydrophobic property of the spacer cation. However, the best 2D perovskite thus far, using aliphatic short butylammonium (BA) cation as spacer cation, shows only a modest tolerance against moisture and heat due to the inferior hydrophobicity as well as the relatively smaller size of the BA cation. Here, a bulkier aromatic phenylethylammonium (PEA) used as a spacer cation to synthesis 2D perovksite in order to achieve highly stable solar cells. By modifying the crystallization process, an average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.50% is achieved, which is the highest reported PCE for aromatic alkylammonium-based lower dimensional perovskite solar cells. Importantly, unencapsulated (PEA)(2)(MA)(3)Pb4I13 devices show enhanced moisture stability compared to other reported perovskite solar cells in harsh moisture environment (72 +/- 2% relative humidity). Moreover, the use of organic materials in p-i-n type device, instead of metal oxides, as electron and hole extraction layers also paves the way toward constructing flexible perovskite solar cells.

Plasmonic nanocomposites (pNCs) are an emerging class of materials that integrate these nanostructures into hierarchical and often multifunctional systems. These pNCs can be highly customizable by modifying both the plasmonic and matrix components, as well as by controlling the nano- to macroscale morphology of the composite as a whole. Assembly at the nanoscale plays a particularly important role in the design of pNCs that exhibit complex or responsive optical function. Due to their scalability and tunability, pNCs provide a versatile platform for engineering new plasmonic materials and for facile integration into optoelectronic device architectures. This review provides a comprehensive survey of recent achievements in pNC structure, design, fabrication, and optical function, along with some examples of their application in optoelectronics and sensing.

In this work, two thiadiazole derivatives (1,3,4-thiadiazolidine-2-thione, TDZT and 1,3,4-thiadiazolidine-2,5-dithione, TDZDT) were added into a perovskite precursor to modulate CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite crystal growth. Thiadiazole derivatives can allow the size of the CH3NH3PbI3 crystals to exceed 800nm and can reduce the grain boundaries. The defect density, calculated using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method for perovskite, was 7 times lower when a certain amount of TDZDT was added. As a result, we obtained a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.04% accompanied by excellent stability under humidity and heat. The unsealed devices retained 91.2% of their initial PCE after 1200 h in 65 +/- 5% relative humidity at room temperature under dark conditions, and over 90% of their initial PCE after 840 h of aging in 30% relative humidity and ambient air at 60-75 degrees C under dark conditions. The result showed that these thiadiazole derivatives can effectively suppress the defects, thus improving the efficiency and stability of the perovskite solar cells.

In particular, the nonradiative recombinations to the electronic ground state from the lowest-energy charge-transfer (CT) states at the donor-acceptor interfaces in the active layer of organic devices, are responsible for a significant part of the voltage losses. Here, to better comprehend the nonradiative voltage loss mechanisms, a fully quantum-mechanical rate formula is employed within the framework of time-dependent perturbation theory, combined with density functional theory. The objective is to uncover the specific contributions of intramolecular vibrations to the CT-state nonradiative recombinations in several model systems, which include small-molecule and polymer donors as well as fullerene and nonfullerene acceptors.

Effect of Cation Composition on the Mechanical Stability of Perovskite Solar Cells	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						cation; mechanical stability; perovskite solar cells; reliability	INDENTATION TECHNIQUES; FRACTURE-TOUGHNESS; HIGH-EFFICIENCY; RELIABILITY; ABSORBER; ADHESION	Photoactive perovskite semiconductors are highly tunable, with numerous inorganic and organic cations readily incorporated to modify optoelectronic properties. However, despite the importance of device reliability and long service lifetimes, the effects of various cations on the mechanical properties of perovskites are largely overlooked. In this study, the cohesion energy of perovskites containing various cation combinations of methylammonium, formamidinium, cesium, butylammonium, and 5-aminovaleric acid is reported. A trade-off is observed between the mechanical integrity and the efficiency of perovskite devices. High efficiency devices exhibit decreased cohesion, which is attributed to reduced grain sizes with the inclusion of additional cations and PbI2 additives. Microindentation hardness testing is performed to estimate the fracture toughness of single-crystal perovskite, and the results indicated perovskites are inherently fragile, even in the absence of grain boundaries and defects. The devices found to have the highest fracture energies are perovskites infiltrated into a porous TiO2/ZrO2/C triple layer, which provide extrinsic reinforcement and shielding for enhanced mechanical and chemical stability.

First-principles calculations demonstrate that Cs2Au2I6 has an optimal band gap that is close to the Shockley-Queisser value. The band gap size is governed by intermediate band formation. Charge disproportionation on Au makes Cs2Au2I6 a double-perovskite material, although it is stoichiometrically a single perovskite. In contrast to most previously discussed double perovskites, Cs2Au2I6 has a direct-band-gap feature, and optical simulation predicts that a very thin layer of active material is sufficient to achieve a high photoconversion efficiency using a polycrystalline film layer. The already confirmed synthesizability of this material, coupled with the state-of-the-art multiscale simulations connecting from the material to the device, strongly suggests that Cs2Au2I6 will serve as the active material in highly efficient, nontoxic, and thin-film perovskite solar cells in the very near future.

Cesium Titanium(IV) Bromide Thin Films Based Stable Lead-free Perovskite Solar Cells	JOULE			English	Article							HALIDE PEROVSKITES; EFFICIENT; LIGHT; CS2AGBIBR6	Significant effort is being devoted to the search for all-inorganic Pb-free halide perovskites (HPs) for photovoltaic applications. However, candidate HPs that combine all the desirable attributes - ease of synthesis, favorable bandgaps, outstanding optoelectronic properties, high stability, no toxicity - are extremely rare. Here, we demonstrate experimentally the promise of cesium titanium(IV) bromide (Cs2TiBr6), a part of the Ti-based vacancy-ordered double-perovskite halides family, in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). We show, for the first time, that high-quality Cs2TiBr6 thin films can be prepared through a facile low-temperature vapor-based method. These films exhibit a favorable bandgap of 1.8 eV, long and balanced carrier-diffusion lengths exceeding 100 nm, suitable energy levels, and superior intrinsic and environmental stability. The first demonstration of Cs2TiBr6 thin films-based PSCs shows stable efficiency of up to 3.3%. Insights into the Cs2TiBr6 film-formation mechanisms and the PSC device operation are provided, pointing to directions for improving Ti-based PSCs.

Quantifying Efficiency Loss of Perovskite Solar Cells by a Modified Detailed Balance Model	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						detailed balance; device model; efficiency loss; perovskite solar cells	PERFORMANCE; LAYERS; RECOMBINATION; CH3NH3PBI3; LENGTHS; LIMIT; FILM	A modified detailed balance model is built to understand and quantify efficiency loss of perovskite solar cells. The modified model captures the light-absorption-dependent short-circuit current, contact and transport-layer-modified carrier transport, as well as recombination and photon-recycling-influenced open-circuit voltage. The theoretical and experimental results show that for experimentally optimized perovskite solar cells with the power conversion efficiency of 19%, optical loss of 25%, nonradiative recombination loss of 35%, and ohmic loss of 35% are the three dominant loss factors for approaching the 31% efficiency limit of perovskite solar cells. It is also found that the optical loss climbs up to 40% for a thin-active-layer design. Moreover, a misconfigured transport layer introduces above 15% of energy loss. Finally, the perovskite-interface-induced surface recombination, ohmic loss, and current leakage should be further reduced to upgrade device efficiency and eliminate hysteresis effect. This work contributes to fundamental understanding of device physics of perovskite solar cells. The developed model offers a systematic design and analysis tool to photovoltaic science and technology.	[Sha, Wei E. I.; Zhang, Hong; Wang, Zi Shuai; Zhu, Hugh L.; Ren, Xingang; Choy, Wallace C.

TiO2 is the most commonly used material for the electron transport layer in PSCs. ZnO is an excellent inorganic semiconductor material owing to its large surface area, easy synthesis, direct electron pathways, large variety of synthesizable nanostructures, and low cost of fabrication. It can potentially replace TiO2 as the electron transport layer material in high efficiency perovskite solar cells based on flexible substrates. However, the number of reported high performance PSCs using ZnO nanostructures is still limited. This review focuses on the recent developments in the application of ZnO nanostructures in PSCs. The current state-of-the-art techniques and the open questions in the area of ZnO-based PSCs are also highlighted.

J	Chen, A; Yossef, M; Zhang, C				Chen, An; Yossef, Mostafa; Zhang, Chao			Strain effect on the performance of amorphous silicon and perovskite solar cells	SOLAR ENERGY			English	Article						Strain effect; Amorphous silicon solar cells; Perovskite solar cells; Experimental investigation		Clean, plentiful, and easy-to-harvest solar energy is the ultimate renewable energy. It is becoming more important as the world begins to take notice of the burgeoning carbon emission problems that come with burning fossil fuels. Thin-film solar cells have been increasingly used for energy harvesting. This paper studies the effect of mechanical deformation on the performances of amorphous silicon (a-Si) and perovskite solar cells. Compression and tension tests were conducted on a-Si solar cells bonded to Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (FRP) plates. Tension tests were also carried out on perovskite solar cells deposited on glass substrate. A projector was used to illuminate the cells during the mechanical tests to simulate 100% sun. J-V characteristic curves were measured at different strain levels until failure of the samples. The experimental results suggest the presence of strain thresholds for a-Si solar cells under both compression and tension loading conditions, below which the a-Si solar cells work properly while the performance degrades rapidly once the strain goes beyond the strain thresholds. Perovskite solar cells are more ductile with a maximum tensile strain of 3%, and they show negligible degradation of performance before the fracture of glass substrate.

Role of Lead Vacancies for Optoelectronic Properties of Lead-Halide Perovskites	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							INITIO MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; NONCOLLINEAR SPIN DFT; AUGMENTED-WAVE METHOD; SOLAR-CELLS; PHOTOINDUCED DYNAMICS; TRIIODIDE PEROVSKITE; IODIDE PEROVSKITES; HYBRID PEROVSKITES; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; CARRIER TRANSPORT	Methylammonium lead iodide perovskite materials have been shown to be efficient in photovoltaic devices. The current fabrication process has not been perfected, leaving defects such as site vacancies, which can trap charge and have a detrimental effect on photogenerated charge carriers. Here focus is placed on the effect a Pb site vacancy has on the charge-carrier dynamics following photoexcitation. The electronic structure of materials with vacancies is often found in open-shell configurations with unpaired electrons in the conduction/valence bands To accurately describe unpaired electrons, spin-polarized and noncollinear spin calculations are performed on both neutral and charged vacancy systems. This work presents spin-polarized and noncollinear spin ground-state electronic structures and nonradiative rates of charge-carrier relaxation and introduces an extension to a novel procedure to compute photoluminescence spectra for open-shell models. This study describes nonadiabatic dynamics of MAPbI(3) models within a Redfield formalism focusing on the role of a Pb vacancy defect on electronic relaxation processes. Results show the vacancy of the Pb ion introducing a new energy state within the unblemished material band gap region. This additional unoccupied state is expected to increase the nonradiative relaxation lifetime of the excited electron, allowing for a longer lifetime of the charge carrier and increased opportunity for secondary relaxation mechanisms or collection to take place.

Reverse Bias Behavior of Halide Perovskite Solar Cells	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						drift-diffusion modeling; halide perovskites; ionic conduction; photovoltaics; reverse bias; stability	RESISTIVE SWITCHING BEHAVIOR; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; IODIDE PEROVSKITE; ION MIGRATION; MOBILE IONS; HYSTERESIS; MECHANISM; INTERPLAY	The future commercialization of halide perovskite solar cells relies on improving their stability. There are several studies focused on understanding degradation under operating conditions in light, but little is known about the stability of these solar cells under reverse bias conditions. Reverse bias stability is important because shaded cells in a module are put into reverse bias by the illuminated cells. In this paper, a phenomenological study is presented of the reverse bias behavior of halide perovskite solar cells and it is shown that reverse bias can lead to a partially recoverable loss in efficiency, primarily caused by a decrease in V-OC. A general mechanism is proposed, supported by drift-diffusion simulations, to explain how these cells breakdown via tunneling caused by accumulated ionic defects and suggests that the reversible loss in efficiency may be due to an electrochemical reaction of these defects. Finally, the implications of these phenomena are discussed and how they can possibly be addressed is also discussed.

However, flexible PSCs typically use expensive and fragile indium-tin oxide as transparent anode and high-vacuum processed noble metal as cathode, resulting in dramatic performance degradation after continuous bending or thermal stress. Here, all-carbon-electrode-based flexible PSCs are fabricated employing graphene as transparent anode and carbon nanotubes as cathode. All-carbon-electrode-based flexible devices with and without spiro-OMeTAD (2,2,7,7-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene) hole conductor achieve power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 11.9% and 8.4%, respectively. The flexible carbon-electrode-based solar cells demonstrate superior robustness against mechanical deformation in comparison with their counterparts fabricated on flexible indium-tin oxide substrates. Moreover, all carbon-electrode-based flexible PSCs also show significantly enhanced stability compared to the flexible devices with gold and silver cathodes under continuous light soaking or 60 degrees C thermal stress in air, retaining over 90% of their original PCEs after 1000 h. The promising durability and stability highlight that flexible PSCs are fully compatible with carbon materials and pave the way toward the realization of rollable and low-cost flexible perovskite photovoltaic devices.

Hybrid Dion-Jacobson 2D Lead Iodide Perovskites	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							TIN HALIDE PEROVSKITES; WHITE-LIGHT EMISSION; SOLAR-CELL; LAYERED PEROVSKITES; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; BAND-GAP; PERFORMANCE; LUMINESCENT; STABILITY	The three-dimensional hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites have shown huge potential for use in solar cells and other optoelectronic devices. Although these materials are under intense investigation, derivative materials with lower dimensionality are emerging, offering higher tunability of physical properties and new capabilities. Here, we present two new series of hybrid two-dimensional (2D) perovskites that adopt the Dion-Jacobson (DJ) structure type, which are the first complete homologous series reported in halide perovskite chemistry. Lead iodide DJ perovskites adopt a general formula A'A(n-1),PbnI3n+1 (A' = 3-(aminomethyl)piperidinium (3AMP) or 4-(aminomethyl)piperidinium (4AMP), A = methylammonium (MA)). These materials have layered structures where the stacking of inorganic layers is unique as they lay exactly on top of another. With a slightly different position of the functional group in the templating cation 3AMP and 4AMP, the as-formed DJ perovskites show different optical properties, with the 3AMP series having smaller band gaps than the 4AMP series. Analysis on the crystal structures and density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the origin of the systematic band gap shift is the strong but indirect influence of the organic cation on the inorganic framework. Fabrication of photovoltaic devices utilizing these materials as light absorbers reveals that (3AMP)(MA)(3)Pb4I13 has the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.32%, which is much higher than that of the corresponding (4AMP)(MA)(3)Pb4I13.

Herein, a solvent-assisted thermal-pressure strategy is developed to promote the secondary growth of perovskite grains in the films. Highly oriented perovskite films are then obtained with large sized grains (5-10 mu m). As a consequence, the photodetectors based on the high-quality CH3NH3PbI3-xClx films exhibit enhanced ophtoelectrical performance, including high on/off ratio (>2.1 x 10(4)), fast response time (54/63 mu s), and high detectivity (similar to 1.3 x 10(12)). This work suggests an effective approach for high-quality perovskite films, which will be promising candidates for other high-efficiency photoelectric devices.

To obtain a deeper understanding of these materials properties, single crystals are regarded as the best platform among various building blocks for fundamental study. Here, we report the mixed-metal MAPb(x)Sn(1-x)Br(3) (MA = CH3NH3) perovskite single crystals grown by top seeded solution growth (TSSG) method. Systematical characterizations were applied to investigating their structures and optoelectronic properties. These single crystals kept higher stability even exposed to air over one month than that of MASnBr(3). The outstanding electrical properties, such as lower trap-state density and higher carrier mobility, were investigated by space charge-limited current (SCLC) and the Hall Effect measurements. More importantly, these perovskite single crystals exhibited much narrower optical band gap (1.77 eV) and longer carrier lifetime (similar to 2 mu s) than those of MAPbBr(3) and MASnBr(3), which showed a greatly potential application in tandem solar cells based on hybrid organic inorganic perovskites with the optimal bandgap of 1.70-1.85 eV.

However, the energy structure at the ZnO-perovskite heterojunction introduces an energy barrier affecting the photocurrent in a device. Here, we report on enhancing the photocurrent in a zinc oxide nanowire (NW)-perovskite heterojunction by employing the piezoelectric effect in NWs. The heterojunction was fabricated on an indium tin oxide coated flexible substrate. The effect of the piezoelectric charges on the photoelectric response of the heterojunction was studied in an electrochemical cell under different bending curvatures of the substrate. Employing piezoelectric effect, the photocurrent of the sample was increased by 46% from the flat state to the maximum outward curvature of 1.02 cm(-1). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed to characterize the sample. The EIS study was performed for a sample at flat and bent states in both dark and light conditions. Based on the results an equivalent circuit model was suggested. Change in the values of the components in the model was analyzed for both the photovoltaic and piezoelectric effects in the heterojunction. This study suggests a simple approach for fabrication of efficient flexible perovskite solar cells. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Charge Carrier Dynamics in Cs2AgBiBr6 Double Perovskite	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							RESOLVED MICROWAVE CONDUCTIVITY; HALIDE DOUBLE PEROVSKITES; SOLAR-CELLS; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; MOBILITIES; LIGHT; SEMICONDUCTORS; SUBSTITUTION; LIFETIMES; POLYMERS	Double perovskites, comprising two different cations, are potential nontoxic alternatives to lead halide perovskites. Here, we characterized thin films and crystals of Cs2AgBiBr6 by time-resolved microwave conductance (TRMC), which probes formation and decay of mobile charges upon pulsed irradiation. Optical excitation of films results in the formation of charges with a yield times mobility product, phi Sigma mu > 1 cm(2)/Vs. On excitation of millimeter-sized crystals, the TRMC signals show, apart from a fast decay, a long-lived tail. Interestingly, this tail is dominant when exciting close to the bandgap, implying the presence of mobile charges with microsecond lifetimes. From the temperature and intensity dependence of the TRMC signals, we deduce a shallow trap state density of around 10(16)/cm(3) in the bulk of the crystal. Despite this high concentration, trap-assisted recombination of charges in the bulk appears to be slow, which is promising for photovoltaic applications.

Hot injection is considered as a common method and is widely used for the preparation of the QDs. However, it suffers from the problems of time consumption and high cost for the mixed-halide CsPb(XY)(3) (XY is a combination of Cl and Br or Br and I) QDs because of its cumbersome preparation of precursors with different halide proportions. Here, the mixed-halide CsPb(XY)(3) QDs were synthesized by a simple and efficient way of mixing the single-halide CsPbX3 (CsPbX3; X = Cl, Br, and I) QDs stock solutions at room temperature. By modulating the ratio of stock solutions precisely, the cubic crystal structure of mixed-halide CsPb(XY)(3) QDs are obtained undergoing anion-exchange and lattice reconstruction processes. The room temperature construction of QDs showed excellent properties of bright PL with the emission peaks tunable over the entire visible light spectra, a narrow full width at half-maximum, and high PLQY, which compare favorably with the QDs prepared by the conventional hot-injection method. Furthermore, backlight light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were fabricated using the mixed-halide QDs cooperated with a commercial 365 nm PL emitting InGaN chip. The QD-assisted LEDs presented the pure and bright emission, as well as the long-term stability (3600 h) under an average relative humidity of 60%.

In contrast to what is known in dye-sensitized solar cells, where V-oc decay is due to back transfer of electrons from the TiO2 conduction band to redox species in the electrolyte, we find that in perovskite solar cells, half of the voltage drop initially results from the fast depolarization of the perovskite layer. In other words, we observe that the polarization of perovskite film contributes to about half of the V-oc in the device. The loss of the other half of V-oc is found to be due to interfacial charge recombination.

One of the advantages of 2D layered nanostructures is their attractive physical, chemical and mechanical properties that could be designed and tuned by manipulating their composition and thickness at the atomic or molecular level during the synthesis process. This review firstly introduces several versatile chemical approaches for the bottom-up fabrication of 2D layered organic-inorganic hybrid materials. A few types of nanolayered organic-inorganic materials and their tunable properties are then presented and discussed from the view of having high-performance characteristics. The chemical attributes that would enhance the properties of nanolayered organic-inorganic materials are also assessed. This article then focuses on the applications of nanolayered organic-inorganic hybrid materials in clean energy research such as batteries, supercapacitors, water splitting, perovskite solar cells and thermoelectric devices. The final section discusses current challenges and future directions of nanolayered organic-inorganic hybrid materials.

We demonstrate a method to modify the surface ligand passivation of perovskite NCs for enhanced colloidal stability and emitting properties by incorporating didodecyl dimethyl ammonium bromide (DDAB). The photoluminescence quantum yield of the NC solution was improved to 96% from 70% and the perovskite film showed fewer trapped sites and enhanced carrier transport ability. The thus fabricated electroluminescent perovskite NC-LEDs exhibited a bright luminance of 11990 cd m(-2), corresponding to 4-times improved external quantum efficiency (EQE), compared to the control device using regular NCs without DDAB.

Acquiring a complete understanding of trap states and dielectric properties in OIHP-based solar cells at the steady state is highly desirable in order to further explore and improve their optoelectronic functionalities and properties. We report CH3NH3PbI3-xClx-based planar solar cells with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.8%. The illumination intensity dependence of the current density-voltage (J-V) revealed the presence of trap-assisted recombination at low fluences. Non-destructive ac impedance spectroscopy (ac-IS) was applied to characterize the device at the steady state. The capacitance-voltage (C-V) spectra exhibited some distinct variations at a wide range of ac modulation frequencies with and without photo-excitations. Since the frequency-dependent chemical capacitance (C mu) is concerned with the surface and bulk related density of states (DOS) in CH3NH3PbI3-xClx, we verified this by fitting the corresponding DOS by a Gaussian distribution function. We ascertained that the electronic sub-gap trap states present in the solution processed CH3NH3PbI3-xClx and their distribution differs from the surface to the bulk. In fact, we demonstrated that both surfaces that were adjacent to the electron and hole transport layers featured analogous DOS. Despite this, photo-and bias-induced giant dielectric responses (i.e. both real and imaginary parts) were detected. A remarkable reduction of C mu at higher frequencies (i.e. more than 100 kHz) was ascribed to the effect of dielectric loss in CH3NH3Pb I3-xClx.

For example, the selection of low-cost or easy-to-prepare materials is essential for back-contacts and hole-transporting layers. Likewise, the choice of conductive substrates, the identification of large-scale manufacturing techniques as well as the development of appropriate aging protocols are key objectives currently under investigation by the international scientific community. This Review analyses the above aspects and highlights the critical points that currently limit the industrial production of PSCs and what strategies are emerging to make these solar cells the leaders in the photovoltaic field.

Optimization of the photoactive layer nanomorphology yields a short-circuit current density value of 27.3 mA/cm(2), one of the highest values in organic solar cells reported to date, which competes with other types of solution-processed solar cells such as perovskite or quantum dot devices. Along with decent open-circuit voltage (0.71 V) and fill factor values (66%), a power conversion efficiency of 12.8% is achieved for the champion devices. Morphology characterizations elucidate that the origin of this high photocurrent is mainly the increased pi-pi coherence length of the acceptor, the domain spacing, as well as the mean-square composition variation of the blend. Optoelectronic measurements confirm a balanced hole and electron mobility and reduced trap-assisted recombination for the best devices.

However, the large energy losses (E-loss) observed in inorganic perovskite solar cells has become a major hindrance impairing the ultimate efficiency. Here, an effective and reproducible method of modifying the interface between a CsPbI2Br absorber and polythiophene hole-acceptor to minimize the E-loss is reported. It is demonstrated that polythiophene, deposited on the top of CsPbI2Br, can significantly reduce electron-hole recombination within the perovskite, which is due to the electronic passivation of surface defect states. In addition, the interfacial properties are improved by a simple annealing process, leading to significantly reduced energy disorder in polythiophene and enhanced hole-injection into the hole-acceptor. Consequently, one of the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.02% from a reverse scan in inorganic mixed-halide perovskite solar cells is obtained. Modifying the perovskite films with annealing polythiophene enables an open-circuit voltage (V-OC) of up to 1.32 V and E-loss of down to 0.5 eV, which both are the optimal values reported among cesium-lead mixed-halide perovskite solar cells to date. This method provides a new route to further improve the efficiency of perovskite solar cells by minimizing the E-loss.

In this contribution, phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and alpha-Fe2O3 synergistically worked together as the electron transport layer (ETL) in planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells. The introduction of fullerene at the top of the alpha-Fe2O3 ETL improved the crystallinity of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite and facilitated electron extraction. As a consequence, a substantially retarded charge recombination largely boosted the short-circuit current density and power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells. The optimized perovskite solar cells with alpha-Fe2O3/PCBM ETL showed a competitive power conversion efficiency of 14.2%, which is 20% higher than that of pristine alpha-Fe2O3-based solar cells. Moreover, alpha-Fe2O3/PCBM-based perovskite solar cells exhibited improved stability compared to the pristine alpha-Fe2O3-based devices, retaining over 95% of their initial values after 45days storage in dark in humid air.

We propose the theoretical lifetime extraction of perovskite solar cells with a mixed-cations lead halide perovskite absorber containing CH3NH3+, CH3(NH2)(2)(+) and Csthorn. The estimated mean time to failure (MTTF) of the triple cation perovskite solar cells is up to 180 days in ambient. Compared with the perovskite solar cells based on CH3NH3PbI3, the triplecation perovskite solar cells, whose power conversion efficiency reaches 18.2% in this study, have a much better performance in terms of thermal stability and humidity stability. Improvements of both performance and stability pave the way for commercialization of perovskite solar cells. (c) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In view of the enhanced and/or diversified function of integrated devices, as compared with conventional devices with limited performance or sole applicability, many integrated power packs have been widely developed by combining different devices, such as a silicon solar cell (SSC), Cu(In,Ga)(Sn,Se)(2) (CIGS), organic solar cell (OSC), dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), perovskite solar cell (PSC), lithium-ion battery (LIB), nanogenerator (NG), supercapacitor (SC), photoelectrosynthetic cell (PESC), and electrolysis cell (ELC), into one unit. In this Review, with a particular emphasis on their recent advances, we cover the integrated solar cell device research in a broad sense and provide an overview of state-of-the-art progress on the integrated solar cell devices based on DSSC and PSC, such as DSSC/LIB, DSSC/SC, DSSC/NG, DSSC/LIB/NG, PSC/OSC, PSC/CIGS, PSC/PSC, PSC/SSC, SSC/SC, PSC/SC, OSC/SC, DSSC/PESC, PSC/PESC, and PSC/ELC, for energy harvesting and storage that are significantly important for self-powering systems and portable/wearable electronics. Finally, the challenges and future outlooks in this promising photovoltaic (PV) field are featured on the basis of current development.

Enhancing efficiency of perovskite solar cells by reducing defects through imidazolium cation incorporation	MATERIALS TODAY ENERGY			English	Article						Imidazolium cation; Perovskite solar cells; Defect passivation; Photovoltaic performance; Tolerance factor	HIGH-PERFORMANCE; CARRIER LIFETIME; PASSIVATION; FORMAMIDINIUM; HALIDES; IODIDE	Regarding the polycrystalline nature of the solution-processed organic/inorganic hybrid perovskite (ABX(3)) thin films, how to enhance the crystallinity of the prepared perovskite films has become the most critical issue for realizing high-performance perovskite solar cells. Recently, A-site cation engineering has been reported to effectively modulate the perovskite crystallization. Nevertheless, owing to the limited tolerance space of three-dimensional (3D) perovskite, the suitable A-site cations are extremely restrained to methylammonium (MA), formamidinium (FA), or Cesium (Cs) cations. We herein described a new A-site cation engineering for CH3NH3PbI3 by utilizing imidazolium (IA) cation that affords a tolerance factor of 1 to modulate the perovskite crystallization. The mixed MA(0.95)IA(0.05)PbI(3) film was revealed to possess an improved film quality and crystallinity as compared to the pristine MAPbI(3) film, which thereby enables a much increased carrier lifetime as a result of the reduced defect density. Consequently, its derived solar cell device yields both enhanced efficiency (17%) and stability, outperforming the control MAPbI(3) device showing an inferior efficiency of 15.7%.

Enhanced crystallization and performance of formamidinium lead triiodide perovskite solar cells through PbI2-SrCl2 modulation	MATERIALS TODAY ENERGY			English	Article						Strontium chloride; Formamidinium lead triiodide perovskite; Morphology modulation; Device performance; Two-step deposition	ORGANOMETAL HALIDE PEROVSKITES; ASSISTED SOLUTION PROCESS; EFFICIENT; PHOTOVOLTAICS; DEPOSITION; STABILITY; ABSORBER; LAYERS; FILMS	An innovative strategy using strontium chloride (SrCl2) as an additive to modulate the crystallization of formamidinium lead triiodide perovskite was developed in a sequential two-step deposition. The results from structural, elemental, and morphological analyses reveal that the SrCl2 additive is capable of improving the quality and morphology of the pre-deposited PbI2 layer by forming a PbI2-SrCl2 interphase complex through plausible solid-solid interactions. This modulates the subsequent reaction between PbI2 and formamidinium iodide (FAI) to enhance the crystallinity of the prepared perovskite film with denser and larger grain domains. The concomitantly enhanced optoelectronic properties of the SrCl2-derived perovskite film enables an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.44% with good reproducibility, which surpasses the performance (PCE: 15.94%) of the control device without SrCl2. This work demonstrates a useful methodology to modulate the morphology and quality of perovskites through solid-solid interactions for achieving high-performance solar cells. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Currently, research has been focused on specifically designing perovskite materials so they can harness the broad spectrum of the visible light wavelength. Inorganic perovskites such as titanates, tantalates, niobates, and ferrites show great promise as visible light-driven photocatalysts for water splitting, whereas hybrid perovskites such as methylammonium lead halides reveal unique photovoltaic and charge transport properties. The main objective of this article is to examine the progress on some recent research on perovskite nanomaterials for both solar cell and water splitting applications. This mini review paper summarizes some recent developments of organic and inorganic perovskite materials (PMs) and provides useful insights for their future improvement. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

It includes energy harvesting from mechanical, thermal, and light sources, and covers materials employed into yarns that can be woven into the textile and films that are deposited onto the surface of the textile. The textile places challenging constraints on the materials, for example, by limiting processing temperatures to typically less than 150 degrees C and presenting a rough, inconsistent surface profile. Example materials include a screen-printable low-temperature composite lead zirconate titanate polymer film and poly(vinylidene fluoride) polymer fibers, both of which have been shown to harvest mechanical energy from textiles. Thermoelectric solutions demonstrated thus far are limited and challenging to implement within a textile. Photovoltaic solutions include organic and dye-sensitized solar cells fabricated into functionalized yarns and as films spray-coated onto textiles. While numerous suitable example materials and textile devices have been demonstrated, work is still needed to develop these into practical energy-harvesting solutions.

The vast majority of study has focused on Pb-based perovskites, which have limited applications because of their inherent toxicity. To enable the broad application of these materials, the properties of lead-free halide perovskites must be explored. Here, two-dimensional, lead-free cesium tin iodide, (CsSnI3), perovskite nanoplates have been synthesized and characterized for the first time. These CsSnI3 nanoplates exhibit thicknesses of less than 4 nm and exhibit significant quantum confinement with photoluminescence at 1.59 eV compared to 1.3 eV in the bulk. Ab initio calculations employing the generalized gradient approximation of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof elucidate that although the dominant intrinsic defects in CsSnI3 do not introduce deep levels inside the band gap, their concentration can be quite high. These simulations also highlight that synthesizing and processing CsSnI3 in Sn-rich conditions can reduce defect density and increase stability, which matches insights gained experimentally. This improvement in the understanding of CsSnI3 represents a step toward the broader challenge of building a deeper understanding of Sn-based halide perovskites and developing design principles that will lead to their successful application in optoelectronic devices.

Dark excitonic states may suppress light emission from such nanocrystals by providing an additional nonradiative recombination channel. Here, we study the composition dependence of dark exciton dynamics in nanocrystals of lead halides by time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy at cryogenic temperatures. The presence of a spin-related dark state is revealed by magneto-optical spectroscopy. The energy splitting between bright and dark states is found to be highly sensitive to both halide elements and organic cations, which is explained by considering the effects of size confinement and charge screening, respectively, on the exchange interaction. These findings suggest the possibility of manipulating dark exciton dynamics in perovskite semiconductor nanocrystals by composition engineering, which will be instrumental in the design of highly efficient light-emitting devices.

Here, we demonstrate a thermochromic solar cell for smart photovoltaic window applications utilizing the structural phase transitions in inorganic halide perovskite caesium lead iodide/bromide. The solar cells undergo thermally-driven, moisture-mediated reversible transitions between a transparent non-perovskite phase (81.7% visible transparency) with low power output and a deeply coloured perovskite phase (35.4% visible transparency) with high power output. The inorganic perovskites exhibit tunable colours and transparencies, a peak device efficiency above 7%, and a phase transition temperature as low as 105 degrees C. We demonstrate excellent device stability over repeated phase transition cycles without colour fade or performance degradation. The photovoltaic windows showing both photoactivity and thermochromic features represent key stepping-stones for integration with buildings, automobiles, information displays, and potentially many other technologies.

Polycrystalline PVSK films are grown by low temperature solution processes that results in the formation of sub-micron scale grains and consequent grain boundaries. The large discrepancy observed between optoelectronic properties of the polycrystalline films and single crystals of PVSK implies that grain boundaries may largely influence the optoelectronic properties of the PVSK thin film. In this article, important studies on the roles of the grain boundaries on optoelectronic properties and stability of the PVSK are reviewed. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, we demonstrate the use of non-stoichiometric precursor chemistry with excess methylammonium halides (MAX; X = I, Br, or Cl) for preparing high-quality similar to 1.75-eV FA(0.83)Cs(0.17)Pb(I0.6Br0.4)(3) perovskite solar cells. Among various methylammonium halides, using excess MABr in the non-stoichiometric precursor exhibits the strongest effect on improving perovskite crystallographic properties and device characteristics without affecting the perovskite composition. In contrast, using excess MAI significantly reduces the bandgap of perovskite due to the replacement of Br with I. Using 40% excess MABr, we demonstrate a single-junction WBG perovskite solar cell with stabilized efficiency of 16.4%. We further demonstrate a 20.3%-efficient 4-terminal tandem device by using a 14.7%-efficient semi-transparent WBG perovskite top cell and an 18.6%-efficient unfiltered (5.6%-efficient filtered) Si bottom cell.

Because of the polycrystalline nature of perovskite thin films, it is crucial to investigate the impact of microstructures on device performance. In this study, we employ ramp-annealing to tailor the texture of perovskite thin films via controlling the nucleation of perovskite grains. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies further suggest that the thin film texture impacts not only the charge collection at the contact but also the carrier transport in the bulk perovskite layer. The combination of the two effects leads to enhanced performance in devices constructed of preferentially oriented perovskite thin films.

Herein, we report a microchannel reactor method for synthesis of CsPbBr3 QDs with tunable spectrum. By adjusting the temperature and velocity of the microchannel reactor, the emission peaks of CsPbBr3 QDs ranging from 520 nm to 430 nm were obtained, which is wider than that of QDs obtained in a traditional flask without changing halide component. The mechanism of photoluminescence (PL) spectral shift of CsPbBr3 QDs was investigated, the result shows that the supersaturation control enabled by the superior mass and heat transfer performance in the microchannel is the key to achieve the wide range of PL spectrum, with only a change in the setting of the temperature controller required. The wide spectrum of CsPbBr3 QDs can be applied to light-emitting diodes (LEDs), photoelectric sensors, lasers, etc.	[Tang, Yong; Lu, Hanguang; Rao, Longshi; Li, Zongtao; Yan, Caiman; Yu, Binhai] South China Univ Technol, Engn Res Ctr Green Mfg Energy Saving & New Energy, Sch Mech & Automot Engn, Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Ding, Xinrui] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mech Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA	Li, ZT (reprint author), South China Univ Technol, Engn Res Ctr Green Mfg Energy Saving & New Energy, Sch Mech & Automot Engn, Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, Peoples R China.	ytang@scut.edu.cn; guyuexuan1999@163.com; memerls@mail.scut.edu.cn; meztli@scut.edu.cn; ding.xinrui@mail.scut.edu.cn; chamenyan@163.com; mebhaiyu@scut.edu.cn	Ding, Xinrui/X-8123-2019; Rao, Longshi/AAD-5044-2020		National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [51735004, 51775199, U1401249]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong ProvinceNational Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2014A30312017]; Special Funds for the Cultivation of Guangdong College Students' Scientific and Technological Innovation.

Minimizing performance degradation induced by interfacial recombination in perovskite solar cells through tailoring of the transport layer electronic properties	APL MATERIALS			English	Article							OPEN-CIRCUIT VOLTAGE; EFFICIENCY; HYSTERESIS; STABILITY; LOSSES; TRAPS	The performance of hybrid organic-inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells is investigated using one-dimensional drift-diffusion device simulations. We study the effects of interfacial defect density, doping concentration, and electronic level positions of the charge transport layer (CTL). Choosing CTLs with a favorable band alignment, rather than passivating CTL-perovskite interfacial defects, is shown to be beneficial for maintaining high power-conversion efficiency, due to reduced minority carrier density arising from a favorable local electric field profile. Insights from this study provide theoretical guidance on practical selection of CTL materials for achieving high-performance perovskite solar cells. (c) 2018 Author(s).

Here we report the observation of suppressed ion migration along the in-plane direction of layered perovskites by studying the conductivity of layered single-crystal perovskites at varied temperatures. Large-area layered perovskite thin single crystals are synthesized by the space-confined method. The absence of ion migration in these layered perovskites can be explained by an increase in the energy required to form an ion vacancy, compared to 3D perovskites. The suppressed ion migration in layered perovskites indicates that they have intrinsically better stability under an electric field and may contribute to the improved perovskite stability in devices made of layered perovskite through the reduction of ion diffusion-induced perovskite degradation or corrosion of charge transport layers and electrodes.

Lewis Base Passivation of Hybrid Halide Perovskites Slows Electron-Hole Recombination: Time-Domain Ab lnitio Analysis	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article							NONADIABATIC MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; PHOTOINDUCED CHARGE SEPARATION; CH3NH3PBI3 PEROVSKITE; ULTRAFAST ELECTRON; SURFACE-DEFECTS; PYXAID PROGRAM; EXCITED-STATE; SOLAR-CELLS; INITIO; PERFORMANCE	Nonradiative electron hole recombination plays a key role in determining photon conversion efficiencies in solar cells. Experiments demonstrate significant reduction in the recombination rate upon passivation of methylammonium lead iodide perovskite with Lewis base molecules. Using nonadiabatic molecular dynamics combined with time-domain density functional theory, we find that the nonradiative charge recombination is decelerated by an order of magnitude upon adsorption of the molecules. Thiophene acts by the traditional passivation mechanism, forcing electron density away from the surface. In contrast, pyridine localizes the electron at the surface while leaving it energetically near the conduction band edge. This is because pyridine creates a stronger coordinative bond with a lead atom of the perovskite and has a lower energy unoccupied orbital compared with thiophene due to the more electronegative nitrogen atom relative to thiophene's sulfur. Both molecules reduce two-fold the nonadiabatic coupling and electronic coherence time. A broad range of vibrational modes couple to the electronic subsystem, arising from inorganic and organic components. The simulations reveal the atomistic mechanisms underlying the enhancement of the excited-state lifetime achieved by the perovskite passivation, rationalize the experimental results, and advance our understanding of charge-phonon dynamics in perovskite solar cells.

With this objective in mind, harnessing solar energy is particularly attractive due to ongoing improvements in silicon-, perovskite-, and organic-based solar cells. Of these, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) constitute a promising technology due to their relatively low cost, moderate conversion efficiency, and robust mechanical properties. An important breakthrough in the development of DSSCs is the use of polymer gel electrolytes. In this work, we employ amphiphilic thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) in the form of sulfonated block ionomer (SBI) homologs for this purpose. Since the midblock of each charged copolymer is hydrophilic, the resultant microphase-separated nanostructures consist of continuous ionic channels that facilitate electron diffusion. A unique characteristic of the SBI archetype studied here is that the morphology can be solvent-templated. We exploit this feature by introducing either hydrophilic or hydrophobic photosensitizers into the DSSCs. When the SBI exhibits a primarily lamellar morphology, a hydrophilic dye yields the highest efficiency (7.0%), whereas the opposite is observed when the nanostructure consists of a solvent-templated nonpolar matrix. Photosensitizer tunability is augmented by the intrinsic mechanical and adhesive properties of a TPE.

An argon plasma treatment is introduced to modify the surface composition by tuning the ratio of organic and inorganic components as well as defect type before deposition of the passivating layer. It can efficiently enhance the charge collection across the perovskite-electrode interface by suppressing charge recombination. Therefore, perovskite solar cells with argon plasma treatment yield enhanced efficiency to 20.4% and perovskite photodetectors can reach their fastest respond speed, which is solely limited by the carrier mobility.

Enhanced fatigue resistance of suppressed hysteresis in perovskite solar cells by an organic crosslinker	SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS			English	Article						Perovskites; Photovoltaics; Hysteresis; Stability	STABILITY; PERFORMANCE; DEGRADATION; ABSORBER; LIFETIME	With record power conversion efficiencies of hybrid perovskite solar cells now exceeding 20% under laboratory conditions, improvements in stability of the cells under real-world working conditions are now key requirements for their commercial success. Here, we present a novel strategy to reduce penetration of humidity and oxygen into perovskite films via incorporation of a diammonium glycol. The two ammonium groups of this molecule allow it to serve as a crosslinker in the structure, bridging two unit cells within a crystallite or even across a grain boundary. In a planar heterojunction solar cell containing PCBM as an electron transport layer, the power conversion efficiency of the cell with similar to 0.1% diammonium glycol in the absorber layer was 13.96%, slightly exceeding that of the glycol-free device (13.53%). Most importantly, the glycol-free device exhibited the typical growth in hysteresis with performance degradation, but hysteresis remained suppressed in the device doped with diammonium glycol, even as its overall performance deteriorated. Futhermore, the chemical stability of the unpackaged device under continuous AM1.5 G illumination at ambient conditions was substantially improved relative to the glycol-free device. Formation of PbI2 was significantly suppressed, which could minimize release of toxic Pb ions.

J	Jiang, CP; Zhang, PP				Jiang, Chuanpeng; Zhang, Pengpeng			Crystalline orientation dependent photoresponse and heterogeneous behaviors of grain boundaries in perovskite solar cells	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							EXCITON BINDING-ENERGY; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; EFFECTIVE MASSES; THIN-FILMS; METHYLAMMONIUM; EFFICIENCY; PERFORMANCE; GROWTH; SIZE; MICROMETER	Using photoconductive atomic force microscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy, we characterize the local electrical properties of grains and grain boundaries of organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) thin films on top of a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/ITO substrate. Three discrete photoconductivity levels are identified among perovskite grains, likely corresponding to the crystal orientation of each grain. Local J-V curves recorded on these grains further suggest an anti-correlation behavior between the short circuit current (J(SC)) and open circuit voltage (V-OC). This phenomenon can be attributed to diffusion-limited surface recombination at the non-selective perovskite-tip contact, where a higher carrier mobility established in the perovskite grain results in an enhanced surface recombination and thus a lower VOC. In addition, the photoresponse of perovskite films displays a pronounced heterogeneity across the grain boundaries, with the boundaries formed between grains of the same photoconductivity level displaying even enhanced photocurrent and open circuit voltage compared to those of the adjacent grain interiors. These observations highlight the significance of controlling the microstructure of perovskite thin films, which will be a necessary route for further improving the efficiency of perovskite solar cells.

This ambition for commercialization has been greatly encouraged by the surge in device performance from 3.8% in 2009 to the state-of-the-art 22.7%. For high device performance, tailoring the interfacial properties is demonstrated essentially important. Being in a molecular scale, the self-assembly monolayers (SAMs) are proved a facile but effective tool for interface modification. And lots of studies have demonstrated that SAMs have a variety of positive effects for perovskite solar cells, including mediating the morphology, improving energy level alignment, passivating trap states, etc. In this mini review, we give an insightful summary on the recent application of SAMs in OIHPSCs, analyze the mechanisms to improve device performance, and provide guidance to SAM-boosted perovskite solar cells for high performance and practical application. Finally, a landscape is depicted for future application of SAMs in perovskite solar cells.

We found that alloy films with high Ga contents of x > 0.3 are amorphous. Amorphous Cd1-xGaxO1+delta alloys in the composition range of 0.3 < x < 0.5 exhibit a high electron mobility of 10-20 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) with a resistivity in the range of 10(-2) to high 10(-4) Omega cm range. The resistivity of the amorphous alloys can also be controlled over orders of magnitude from 7 X 10(-4) to 77 Omega cm by controlling the oxygen stoichiometry. Over the entire composition range, these crystalline and amorphous alloys have a large tunable intrinsic band gap range of 2.2-4.8 eV as well as a conduction band minimum range of 5.8-4.5 eV below the vacuum level. Our results suggest that amorphous Cd1-xGaxO1+delta alloy films with 0.3 < x < 0.4 have favorable optoelectronic properties as transparent conductors on flexible and/or organic substrates, whereas the band edges and electrical conductivity of films with 0.3 < x < 0.7 can be manipulated for transparent thin-film transistors as well as electron transport layers.

Chemical Stabilization of Perovskite Solar Cells with Functional Fulleropyrrolidines	ACS CENTRAL SCIENCE			English	Article							HOLE-TRANSPORTING MATERIALS; HIGHLY EFFICIENT; DEGRADATION; MIGRATION; CORE	While perovskite solar cells have invigorated the photovoltaic research community due to their excellent power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), these devices notably suffer from poor stability. To address this crucial issue, a solution-processable organic chemical inhibition layer (OCIL) was integrated into perovskite solar cells, resulting in improved device stability and a maximum PCE of 16.3%. Photoenhanced self-doping of the fulleropyrrolidine mixture in the interlayers afforded devices that were advantageously insensitive to OCIL thickness, ranging from 4 to 190 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicated that the fulleropyrrolidine mixture improved device stability by stabilizing the metal electrode and trapping ionic defects (i.e., I-) that originate from the perovskite active layer. Moreover, degraded devices were rejuvenated by repeatedly peeling away and replacing the OCIL/Ag electrode, and this repeel and replace process resulted in further improvement to device stability with minimal variation of device efficiency.

To realize such solar cells, the device geometry, the device processing, and the contact materials have to be modified in comparison to single junction perovskite solar cells. In this study, perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells are designed allowing for the generation of short-circuit current densities and energy conversion efficiencies exceeding 20 mA cm(-2) and 30%, while using realistic device structures. High short-circuit current densities can be achieved by minimizing reflection losses and optical losses of the contact layers. A hybrid approach is used to investigate the optics by combining finite-difference time-domain simulations with experimental measurements. Details on the nanophotonic design will be provided and discussed.

Here, a photodetector based on SC-TF perovskite active layer is reported with a record performance of a 50 million gain, 70 GHz gain-bandwidth product, and a 100-photon level detection limit at 180 Hz modulation bandwidth, which as far as we know are the highest values among all the reported perovskite photodetectors. The superior performance of the device originates from replacing polycrystalline thin film by a thickness-optimized SC-TF with much higher mobility and longer recombination time. The results indicate that high-performance perovskite devices based on SC-TF may become competitive in modern optoelectronics.

However, it remains unclear how functional groups attached to the fullerene derivatives influence device performances. Herein, the performance of an ETL based on [6,6]-phenyl-C-61 butyric acid 2-ethylhexyl ester (PC61BEH) was investigated. It was demonstrated that the branched alkyl chain of the fullerene derivative can highly influence the solubility, film morphology, passivation ability, ETL-perovskite contact, and electron extraction ability of the fullerene derivative. Overall device performance and stability are dependent on these characteristics. The results suggest that further design and improvement of fullerene-based PSCs performance may be possible through optimization of the addend structure and functionality.

This MAPbI(3)/rGO composite is shown to be an outstanding visible-light photocatalyst for H-2 evolution in aqueous HI solution saturated with MAPbI(3). Powder samples of MAPbI(3)/rGO (100 mg) show a H-2 evolution rate of 93.9 mu mol h(-1), which is 67 times faster than that of pristine MAPbI(3), under 120 mW cm(-2) visible-light (lambda >= 420 nm) illumination, and the composite is highly stable showing no significant decrease in the catalytic activity after 200 h (i.e., 20 cycles) of repeated H-2 evolution experiments. The electrochemiluminescence performance of MAPbI(3) is investigated to explore the charge transfer process, to find that the photogenerated electrons in MAPbI(3) are transferred to the rGO sites, where protons are reduced to H-2.

Herein, we develop a hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA)-mediated one-step solution-processing deposition strategy that leads to the formation of high-purity and grain-boundary-passivation CH3NH3PbI3 film and thereby advances cell optoelectronic performance. Through morphological and structural characterizations and theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that HMTA fully occupies the moisture-exposed surface to build a bridge across grain boundary and coordinates with Pb ions to inhibit the formation of detrimental PbI2. Such HMTA-mediated grown CH3NH3PbI3 films achieves a decent augmentation of power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 12.70% to 17.87%. A full coverage of PbI2-free CH3NH3PbI3 surface on ZnO also boosts the device's stability and reproducibility.

On the other hand, the stability of perovskites remains a critical issue. In this work, we report a quantitative and systematic investigation of in situ cleaved MAPbBr(3) single-crystal degradation processes in X-ray, N-2, O-2, and H2O environments. The high-quality crystals were monitored by high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy with careful control of the exposure time and pressure. The detailed electronic structure and compositional changes of the crystal were tracked throughout the different exposures, and these studies provided insights into the various degradation mechanisms. We identified that similar to 10% of the surface MAPbBr(3) degraded to metallic lead under X-rays in vacuum, while N-2 could protect the sample from the degradation for 9 h under the same condition. Other measurements showed that while the surface was not sensitive to pure O-2, it was susceptible to H2O exposure within the top 0.37 nm and a reaction threshold of similar to 10(8) Langmuir was found. Below the threshold, H2O acted only as an n-type dopant; above it, the surface began to decompose. These observations highlight possible future directions to improve the material stability by environmental control.

For the latter compound, containing both MA+ and FA+ ions, thermal decomposition of the perovskite phase was observed to occur in two stages. The first stage of decomposition occurs at a faster rate compared to the second stage and is only observed at relatively low temperatures (T < 150 degrees C). For the second stage, we find that both decomposition rate and the activation energy have similar values for Cs-0.05(MA(0.17)FA(0.83))(0.95)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)(3) and Cs(0.17)FA(0.83)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)(3), which suggests that the first stage mainly involves reaction of MA+ and the second stage mainly FA(+).

In order to enable perovskite PDs possessing extended NIR photoresponse, novel n-type low bandgap conjugated polymer, poly[(N, N'bis(2-octyldodecyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalene diimide-2,6-diyl) (2,5-dioctyl-3,6-di(thiophen-2-yl) pyrrolo[3,4-c] pyrrole-1,4-dione-5,5'-diyl)] (NDI-DPP), which has strong absorption in the NIR region, is developed and then employed in perovskite PDs. By the formation of type II band alignment between NDI-DPP with single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), the NIR absorption of NDI-DPP is exploited, which contributes to the NIR photoresponse for the perovskite PDs, where perovskite is incorporated with NDI-DPP and SWCNTs as well. In addition, SWCNTs incorporated with perovskite active layer can offer the percolation pathways for high charge-carrier mobility, which tremendously boosts the charge transfer in the photoactive layer, and consequently improves the photocurrent in the visible region. As a result, the perovskite PDs exhibit the responsivities of approximate to 400 and approximate to 150 mA W-1 and the detectivities of over 6 x 10(12) Jones (1 Jones = 1 cm Hz(1/2) W-1) and over 2 x 10(12) Jones in the visible and NIR regions, respectively. This work reports the development of perovskite PDs with NIR photoresponse, which is terrifically beneficial for the practical applications of perovskite PDs.

Precursor salts containing these cations, molecules and halide ions dissolved in solvents are used to prepare perovskite films. Perovskite film formation takes place through the reaction of precursor elements, which is assisted by various processing conditions such as thermal annealing, moisture and solvent treatment. This review focuses on various perovskite formation and crystallization routes with respect to processing parameters including the precursor solvent, solvent mixture, temperature, time, formation of solvent led-intermediate complex species, doping and humidity. Adding water as the dopant to the precursor solvent and exposure to moisture from atmospheric humidity to improve perovskite film quality are also discussed. Processing conditions and crystallization processes are described in correlation with the perovskite film morphology, crystallinity, defects, charge transport and device performance. This article will aim to highlighting recent findings in the selection of solvents in the crystallization of perovskite films, solvent induced intermediate phases, and effects of water in assisting perovskite crystallization for improved film quality and device performance. The review will also present various structural and nanoscale characterization techniques that have been used to probe solvent based intermediate species transformation processes to the perovskite phase and understand the effects in correlation with device performance.

Here, we report a new approach to synthesize lead-free all inorganic perovskites (Cs2SnIxCl6-x) using hydriodic acid (HI) demonstrating greatly enhanced environmental stability and tunable optical properties by controlling the I-/Cl- ratios. Single phase perovskites can be achieved with a low iodine or chlorine content, and a phase separation occurs in the binary system with closer iodine and chlorine dopings. UV-vis diffuse reflectance and photoluminescence measurements reveal tunable band gaps of Cs2SnIxCl6-x perovskites from the UV to the infrared region. The mixed halide perovskite with a lower chloride content shows significantly higher photoluminescence intensity. The thermal stability of mixed halide all-inorganic perovskites is continuously improved as the Cl content increases. The synthesis of Sn-based perovskites with tunable optical properties and environmental stability represents one step further toward the realization of the stable lead-free all inorganic perovskites.

J	Morimoto, T; Nagaosa, N				Morimoto, Takahiro; Nagaosa, Naoto			Nonreciprocal current from electron interactions in noncentrosymmetric crystals: roles of time reversal symmetry and dissipation	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							TETRATHIAFULVALENE-PARA-CHLORANIL; CHARGE-TRANSFER CRYSTAL; PEROVSKITE SOLAR-CELLS; MESOSCOPIC CONDUCTORS; TRANSPORT; EXCITATIONS; INVARIANT; FORMALISM; DRIVEN	In noncentrosymmetric crystals with broken inversion symmetry I, the I-V (I: current, V: voltage) characteristic is generally expected to depend on the direction of I, which is known as nonreciprocal response and, for example, found in p-n junction. However, it is a highly nontrivial issue in translationally invariant systems since the time-reversal symmetry T plays an essential role, where the two states at crystal momenta k and -k are connected in the band structure. Therefore, it has been considered that the external magnetic field (B) or the magnetic order which breaks the T-symmetry is necessary to realize the nonreciprocal I-V characteristics, i.e., magnetochiral anisotropy. Here we theoretically show that the electron correlation in T-broken multi-band systems can induce nonreciprocal I-V characteristics without T-breaking. An analog of Onsager's relation shows that nonreciprocal current response without T -breaking generally requires two effects: dissipation and interactions. By using nonequilibrium Green's functions, we derive general formula of the nonreciprocal response for two-band systems with onsite interaction. The formula is applied to Rice-Mele model, a representative 1D model with inversion breaking, and some candidate materials are discussed. This finding offers a coherent understanding of the origin of nonreciprocal I-V characteristics, and will pave a way to design it.

Electrochemistry, spectroelectrochemistry, and photoelectrochemistry could be viable tools both for analyzing the optoelectronic features of these materials and for assembling them into hybrid architectures (e.g., solar cells). At the same time, the instability of these materials limits the pool of solvents and electrolytes that can be employed in such experiments. The focus of our study is to establish a stability window for electrochemical tests for all-inorganic CsPbBr3 and hybrid organic-inorganic MAPbI(3) perovskites. In addition, we aimed to understand the reduction and oxidation events that occur and to assess the damage done during these processes at extreme electrochemical conditions. In this vein, we demonstrated the chemical, structural, and morphological changes of the films in both reductive and oxidative environments. Taking all these results together as a whole, we propose a set of boundary conditions and protocols for how electrochemical experiments with lead halide perovskites should be carried out and interpreted. The presented results will contribute to the understanding of the electrochemical response of these materials and lead to a standardization of results in the literature so that comparisons can more easily be made.

Realizing Efficient Lead-Free Formamidinium Tin Triiodide Perovskite Solar Cells via a Sequential Deposition Route	ADVANCED MATERIALS			English	Article						formamidinium; morphology control; sequential deposition; solar cells; tin-based perovskites	FREE HALIDE PEROVSKITE; PERFORMANCE; PHOTOVOLTAICS; STABILITY; FILM; CRYSTALLIZATION; RECOMBINATION; TRANSISTORS; FABRICATION; TRANSPORT	Recently, the evolved intermediate phase based on iodoplumbate anions that mediates perovskite crystallization has been embodied as the Lewis acid-base adduct formed by metal halides (serve as Lewis acid) and polar aprotic solvents (serve as Lewis base). Based on this principle, it is proposed to constitute efficient Lewis acid-base adduct in the SnI2 deposition step to modulate its volume expansion and fast reaction with methylammonium iodide (MAI)/formamidinium iodide (FAI) (FAI is studied hereafter). Herein, trimethylamine (TMA) is employed as the additional Lewis base in the tin halide solution to form SnY2-TMA complexes (Y = I-, F-) in the first-step deposition, followed by intercalating with FAI to convert into FASnI. It is shown that TMA can facilitate homogeneous film formation of a SnI2 (+SnF2) layer by effectively forming intermediate SnY2-TMA complexes. Meanwhile, its relatively larger size and weaker affinity with SnI2 than FA+ ions will facilitate the intramolecular exchange with FA+ ions, thereby enabling the formation of dense and compact FASnI(3) film with large crystalline domain (>1 mu m). As a result, high power conversion efficiencies of 4.34% and 7.09% with decent stability are successfully accomplished in both conventional and inverted perovskite solar cells, respectively.

The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of flexible PSCs reaches 14.9% with a short-circuit current density (J(sc)) of 17.9 mA/cm(2), open-circuit voltage (V-oc) of 1.09, and fill factor (ff) of 0.74. Moreover, the Ti metal-based PSCs exhibit a superior fatigue resistance over indium tin oxide/poly(ethylene terephthalate) substrate. Flexible PSCs maintain 100% of their initial PCE even after PSCs are bent 1000 times at a bending radius of 4 mm. This excellent performance of flexible PSCs is due to high crystalline quality and low oxygen vacancy concentration of TiO2 layer. The concentration of oxygen vacancies in the oxidized Ti metal surface controls the electric function of TiO2 as ETL of PSCs. A decrease in the oxygen vacancy concentration of the TiO2 layer is critical to improving the electron collection efficiency of the ETL. Our results suggest that Ti metal-based PSCs possess excellent mechanical properties, which can be applied to the renewable energy source for flexible electronics.

In this manner, self-charging energy devices consisting of photovoltaic cells and energy storage units can serve as sustainable and portable distributed power sources that can concurrently generate and store electric energy without the need for external charging circuits. Herein, an integrated perovskite solar capacitor (IPSC) was realized by combining a perovskite solar cell (PSC) and a supercapacitor in a single device. Taking advantages of nanocarbon electrodes, the IPSCs possess a simple configuration, compact structure, and well-matched operation voltage. The IPSCs could be rapidly charged by different modes (including the photo-charging mode, galvanostatic-charging mode, and photoassisted-galvanostatic-charging mode), and showed a remarkable overall photo-chemical-electricity energy conversion efficiency as high as 7.1% in the photo-charging mode. Moreover, the IPSCs could work efficiently under weak light illumination. This study provides new insights for the design of novel integrative energy devices that combine the functions of solar power harvesting and electrochemical energy storage.

The majority of the Pb-free HP candidates that are being explored for PSCs either suffer from instability issues and have unfavorable defect properties or have unsuitable bandgaps for PSC applications. We report the prediction of a promising new family of all inorganic HPs based on the nontoxic, earth-abundant, ultrastable Ti(IV) for use in PSCs. We show that the Ti-based HPs possess a combination of several desirable attributes, including suitable bandgaps, excellent optical absorption, benign defect properties, and high stability. In particular, we show experimentally that representative members of the Ti-based HP family, Cs(2)TiI(x)aBr(6-x),, have bandgaps between the ideal values of 1.38 and 1.78 eV for single-junction and tandem photovoltaic applications, that can be tuned respectively.

Charge-Carrier Dynamics and Crystalline Texture of Layered Ruddlesden-Popper Hybrid Lead Iodide Perovskite Thin Films	ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							EXCITON BINDING-ENERGY; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; EFFECTIVE MASSES; METHYLAMMONIUM; RECOMBINATION; DEGRADATION; MOBILITIES; TRANSPORT; MICROSTRUCTURE; DISSOCIATION	Solution-processable organic metal halide Ruddlesden-Popper phases have shown promise in optoelectronics because of their efficiencies in solar cells along with increased material stability relative to their three-dimensional counterparts (CH3NH3PbI3). Here, we study the layered material butylammonium methylammonium lead iodide (C4H9NH3)(2)(CH3NH3)(n-1)PbnI3n+1 for values of n ranging from 1 to 4. Thin films cast from solution show a gradual change in the crystalline texture of the two-dimensional lead iodide layers from being parallel to the substrate to perpendicular with increasing n. Contactless time resolved microwave conductivity measurements show that the average recombination rate order increases with n and that the yield mobility products and carrier lifetimes of these thin films are much lower than that of CH3NH3PbI3, along with increased higher-order recombination rate constants.

Compositional Engineering for Efficient Wide Band Gap Perovskites with Improved Stability to Photoinduced Phase Segregation	ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							DETAILED BALANCE LIMIT; SOLAR-CELLS; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; CATION; IODIDE; PERFORMANCE; TOLERANCE; ABSORBER; SILICON; DOPANT	Metal halide perovskites are attractive candidates for the wide band gap absorber in tandem solar cells. While their band gap can be tuned by partial halide substitution, mixed halide perovskites often have lower open-circuit voltage than would be expected and experience photoinduced trap formation caused by halide segregation. We investigate solar cell performance and photostability across a compositional space of formamidinium (FA) and cesium (Cs) at the A-site at various halide compositions and show that using more Cs at the A-site rather than more Br at the X-site to raise band gap is more ideal as it improves both Voc and photostability. We develop band gap maps and design criteria for the selection of perovskite compositions within the Cs(x)FA(1-x)Pb(Bryl) space. With this, we identify perovskites with tandem relevant band gaps of 1.68 and 1.75 eV that demonstrate high device efficiencies of 17.4 and 16.3%, respectively, and significantly improved photostability compared to that of the higher Br-containing compositions.

Mixed cation perovskites have emerged as champion photovoltaic materials with power conversion efficiencies exceeding 22%. However, there has been relatively little work done to explore local cation-related compositional inhomogeneities in mixed cation perovskite films. Such studies are necessary because hybrid perovskite optical properties and, consequently, their photovoltaic performance strongly depend on composition. Here, we perform spatially resolved, subdiffraction infrared photo thermal heterodyne imaging measurements to probe cation-specific compositional distributions within FA(x)MA(1-x)PBI(3) perovskite films. Our measurements reveal that these perovskites possess large compositional spatial heterogeneities with cation distributions varying on average similar to 20% from expected ensemble stoichiometries. Correlated emission measurements show intrafilm emission energies differing by over 30 meV due to these compositional differences. These measurements thus reveal cation stoichiometric heterogeneities and their direct impact on local photovoltaic response-determining opticalproperties of mixed cation perovskites.

Critical Role of Interface and Crystallinity on the Performance and Photostability of Perovskite Solar Cell on Nickel Oxide	ADVANCED MATERIALS			English	Article						crystallinity; LiNiO; perovskite solar cells; photostability	METHYLAMMONIUM LEAD IODIDE; ELECTRON-TRANSPORT LAYER; PHOTOLUMINESCENCE BLINKING; HIGH-EFFICIENCY; HYSTERESIS; GROWTH; DEGRADATION; PASSIVATION; STABILITY; MIGRATION	Hybrid perovskites are on a trajectory toward realizing the most efficient single-junction, solution-processed photovoltaic devices. However, a critical issue is the limited understanding of the correlation between the degree of crystallinity and the emergent perovskite/hole (or electron) transport layer on device performance and photostability. Here, the controlled growth of hybrid perovskites on nickel oxide (NiO) is shown, resulting in the formation of thin films with enhanced crystallinity with characteristic peak width and splitting reminiscent of the tetragonal phase in single crystals. Photophysical and interface sensitive measurements reveal a reduced trap density at the perovskite/NiO interface in comparison with perovskites grown on poly(3,4-ethylene dioxy thiophene) polystyrene sulfonate. Photovoltaic cells exhibit a high open circuit voltage (1.12 V), indicating a near-ideal energy band alignment. Moreover, photostability of photovoltaic devices up to 10-Suns is observed, which is a direct result of the superior crystallinity of perovskite thin films on NiO. These results elucidate the critical role of the quality of the perovskite/hole transport layer interface in rendering high-performance and photostable optoelectronic devices.

Cyclopropenium (C3H3)(+) as an Aromatic Alternative A-Site Cation for Hybrid Halide Perovskite Architectures	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							METHYLAMMONIUM LEAD IODIDE; SOLAR-CELL; CH3NH3PBI3 PEROVSKITE; CARRIER LIFETIME; PHASE; DEGRADATION; TRIHALIDE; EMERGENCE	Hybrid halide perovskites are an emerging class of photovoltaic materials, boasting high solar efficiencies from relatively simple preparations. However, the chemical diversity of the A-site organic cation is limited, generally due to steric constraints of the (PbI3)(-) cage. Herein we describe the use of a non-benzenoid Hiickel aromatic, (C3H3)(+), as a viable alternative to the readily employed methylammonium, formamidinium, and guanidinium A-site cations. (C3H3)(+) may lead to greater moisture stability due to the lack of an acidic proton relative to the current (H-NR3)(+)-based systems while still boasting a narrow electronic band gap (E-g = 1.5 eV) and mobile holes and electrons (m(h)* = -1.27 and m(e)* = 0.77, respectively).

Herein a method is introduced to form 2D/3D stacking structures by the reaction of 3D perovskite with n-Butylamine (BA). Different from regular treatment with n-Butylammonium iodide (BAI) where 2D perovskite with various layers form, the reaction of BA with MAPbI(3) only produce (BA)(2)PbI4, which has better protection due to more organic ligands in (BA)(2)PbI4 than the mixture of 2D perovskites. Compared to BAI treatment, BA treatment results in smoother 2D perovskite layer on 3D perovskites with a better coverage. The photovoltaic devices with 2D/3D stacking structures show much improved stability in comparison to their 3D counterparts when subjected to heat stress tests. Moreover, the conversion of defective surface into 2D layers also induces passivation of the 3D perovskites resulting in an enhanced efficiency.

Here, we directly image carrier cooling in polycrystalline CH3NH3PbI3 films with nanometer spatial resolution. We observe that upon photon absorption, highly energetic carriers rapidly thermalize with the lattice at different rates across the film. The initial carrier temperatures vary by many multiples of the lattice temperature across hundreds of nanometers, a factor that cannot be accounted for by excess photon energy above the bandgap alone or in variations of the initial carrier density. Electron microscopy suggests that morphology plays a critical role in determining the initial carrier temperature and that carriers in small crystal domains decay slower than those in large crystal domains. Our results demonstrate that local disorder dominates the observed carrier behavior, highlighting the importance of making local rather than averaged measurements in these materials.

Colloidal Nanocrystals of Lead-Free Double-Perovskite (Elpasolite) Semiconductors: Synthesis and Anion Exchange To Access New Materials	NANO LETTERS			English	Article						Lead-free perovskites; colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals; anion exchange; elpasolites	HALIDE DOUBLE PEROVSKITE; SOLAR-CELLS; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; RATIONAL DESIGN; CATION-EXCHANGE; QUANTUM DOTS; BR; CS2AGBIBR6; STABILITY; CRYSTAL	Concerns, about the toxicity and instability of lead-halide perovskites have driven a recent surge in research toward alternative lead-free perovskite materials, including lead-free double perovskites with the elpasolite structure and visible bandgaps. Synthetic approaches to this class of materials remain limited, however, and no examples of heterometallic elpasolites as nanomaterials have been reported. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of colloidal nano crystals of Cs2AgBiX6 (X = Cl, Br) elpasolites using a hot injection approach. We further show that postsynthetic modification through anion exchange and cation extraction can be used to convert these nanocrystals to new materials including Cs2AgBiI6, which was previously unknown experimentally. Nanocrystals of Cs2AgBiI6, synthesized via a novel anion-exchange. protocol using trimethylsilyl iodide, have strong absorption throughout the visible region, confirming theoretical predictions that this material could be a promising photovoltaic absorber. The synthetic methodologies presented here are expected to be broadly generalizable. This work demonstrates that nanocrystal ion-exchange reactivity can be used to discover and develop new lead-free halide perovskite materials that may be difficult or impossible to access through direct synthesis.

Herein, we demonstrate a pressure-assisted space-confined solvent-engineering strategy to grow highly oriented, pinhole, free thin films of CH3NH3PbI3 with large-scale crystalline grains, high smoothness, and crystalline fusion on grain boundaries. These single-crystalline grains vertically span the entire film thickness. Such a film feature dramatically reduces recombination loss and then improves the transport property of charge carriers in the films. Consequently, the photodetector devices, based on the high-quality CH3NH3PbI3 films, exhibit high photocurrent (105 mu A under 671 nm laser with a power density of 20.6 mW/cm(2) at 10 V, good stability, and, especially, an ultrahigh on/off ratio (I-light/I-dark > 2.2 X 10(4) under an incident light of 20.6 mW/cm(2)). These excellent performances indicate that the high-quality films will be potential candidates in other CH3NH3PbI3-based photoelectric devices.

Specifically, the Br and I counterparts have shown unprecedented photoluminescence properties, including precise wavelength tuning (530-790 nm), narrow emission linewidths (<100 meV) and high photoluminescence emitting FAPb(Cl1-xBrx)(3) NCs lags behind their green and red counterparts and the mechanism of their formation remains unclear. Herein, we report the formation of FAPb(Cl1-xBrx)(3) NCs with stable emission between 440 and 520 nm in a fully automated droplet-based microfluidic reactor and subsequent reaction upscaling, in conventional laboratory glassware. The thorough parametric screening allows for the elucidation of parametric zones (FA-to-Pb and Br-to-Cl molar ratios, temperature, and excess oleic acid) for the formation of nanoplatelets and/or NCs. In contrast to CsPb(Cl1-xBrx)(3) NCs, based on online parametric screening and offline structural characterization, we demonstrate that the controlled synthesis of Cl-rich perovskites (above 60 at% Cl) with stable emission remains a challenge due to fast segregation of halide ions.

Open circuit voltage of 1.03 +/- 0.02 (highest at 1.07) V was obtained, which was 100 mV higher than that of reference devices using conventional high-temperature-processed mesoporous TiO2 as electron-transport-material, or 0.91 +/- 0.03 (highest at 0.96) V. The increased open circuit voltage along with slightly-upgraded fill factor then helped to upgrade power conversion efficiency to 13.21 +/- 0.7% (highest at 14.5%) under simulated illumination of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW/cm(2), compared to 10.13 +/- 1.34% (highest at 10.46%) of the reference devices. The improvement is ascribed to the upgraded built-in potential. Mott-Schottky study showed that, using low-temperature-processed SnO2 as electron-transport-material, higher built-in-potential (0.94 V) could be obtained, compared with 0.89 V of TiO2 based device, which then retarded charge recombination and thus increased both of the open circuit voltage and fill factor. Meanwhile, stability was test. Without any encapsulation, storage stability up to 150 days (3600 h, the test is still on-going) has been obtained for devices kept in dark (relative humidity similar to 45%), which is contributed by the low photo-activity SnO2, and the adoption of formamidinium cations, bromide anions co-doped perovskite film.

Cs-intercalation is useful for forming high-quality Cs-doped triple cation perovskite films with larger gains and band gap as compared with perovskite films without Cs doping, leading to impressively enhanced photoluminescence lifetime and open circuit voltage (V-oc). Meanwhile, incorporating Cs+ into perovskite structure can result in lower charge-extraction time and prolonged charge-recombination lifetime, which are advantageous to improve the device performance. More importantly, Cs-doped triple cation PHJ perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibit better stability. They could maintain about 80% original PCE even exposed to air environments (humidity approximate to 40%) for over 500 hr without any encapsulation, while similar ones without Cs-doping only maintain about 60% original PCE. The research work demonstrates that triple or multiple cation mixture is an effective strategy for structuring highly-efficient and stable PHJ-PSCs via low-temperature process, which may accelerate the commercialization of PSCs fabricated via large-scale printing techniques.

However, some of their properties, such as thermal instability, toxicity, and current-voltage hysteresis still remain elusive. Ion migration, which has been proven to be a thermala-ctivated process, is regarded as one of the major origins of the hysteresis and thus detrimental to the long-term stability of the optoelectronic devices. Nevertheless, by using the external electric field to pole the perovskite, ion migration would be possible to be utilized to create dynamic electronic junctions. In this paper, electric-field-induced dynamic electronic junctions have been manipulated for photodetection and energy harvesting through the ion migration under external electric field. Ion-migration-induced p-n or n-p junction has been successfully created via tuning the polarity of the external applied voltage, which is used for photodetection with a relatively fast response. By freezing out of the nonuniformly distributed ions after migration at low temperature, we demonstrate that the ion-migration-induced dynamic junctions can function as an energy harvesting device with an external quantum efficiency of 20%.

Transient Sub-bandgap States in Halide Perovskite Thin Films	NANO LETTERS			English	Article						Metal halide perovskite; transient absorption microscopy; ultrafast spectroscopy; polaron states; spatially resolved measurements	SOLAR-CELLS; CARRIER; GRAINS	Metal halide perovskites are promising solar energy materials, but their mechanism of action remains poorly understood. It has been conjectured that energetically stabilized states such as those corresponding to polarons, quasiparticles in which the carriers are dressed with phonons, are responsible for their remarkable photophysical properties. Yet, no direct evidence of polarons or other low-energy states have been reported despite extensive efforts. Such states should manifest as below bandgap features in transient absorption and photoluminescence measurements. Here,. we use single-particle transient absorption microscopy on MAPbI(3) (MA = methylammonium) to unambiguously identify spectrally narrow sub-bandgap states directly; we demonstrate that such signals are completely averaged away in ensemble measurements. Carrier temperature-dependent studies suggest that hot carriers are directed toward transient low-energy states which are immune from permanent defects and traps, thereby giving rise to low carrier recombination rates and ultimately high power conversion efficiency in devices. The utilization of short:lived sub-bandgap states Maybe a key design principle that propels-widespread use of highly heterogeneous material's in optoelectronic applications.

However, the long-term stability of MAPbI(3)-based solar cells has yet to be achieved. Besides the well-known chemical and thermal instabilities, significant native ion migration in lead halide perovskites leads to current-voltage hysteresis and photoinduced phase segregation. Recently, it is further revealed that, despite having excellent chemical stability, the Au electrode can cause serious solar cell degradation due to Au diffusion into MAPbI(3). In addition to Au, many other metals have been used as electrodes in MAPbI(3) solar cells. However, how the external metal impurities introduced by electrodes affect the long-term stability of MAPbI(3) solar cells has rarely been studied. A comprehensive study of formation energetics and diffusion dynamics of a number of noble and transition metal impurities (Au, Ag, Cu, Cr, Mo, W, Co, Ni, Pd) in MAPbI(3) based on first-principles calculations is reported herein. The results uncover important general trends of impurity formation and diffusion in MAPbI(3) and provide useful guidance for identifying the optimal metal electrodes that do not introduce electrically active impurity defects in MAPbI(3) while having low resistivities and suitable work functions for carrier extraction.

In this work, we investigate the optoelectronic quality of RIR-MAPLEdeposited CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI(3)) perovskite films and report on the fabrication of perovskite solar cells in which the absorber is deposited by RIR-MAPLE. We find the composition, morphology, and optical properties of these perovskite films to be comparable to those produced by more conventional methods, such as spin coating. The champion device reaches a stabilized power conversion efficiency of over 12%, a high value for perovskite solar cells deposited by a laser ablation process, highlighting the ability of this new technique to produce device-quality films.

Here, we demonstrate a deposition scheme for perovskite module fabrication with spray coating of a TiO2 electron transport layer (ETL) and blade coating of both a perovskite absorber layer and a spiro-OMeTAD-based hole transport layer (HTL). The TiO2 ETL remaining in the interconnection between subcells significantly affects the module performance. Reducing the TiO2 thickness changes the interconnection contact from a Schottky diode to ohmic behavior. Owing to interconnection resistance reduction, the perovskite modules with a 10 nm TiO2 layer show enhanced performance mainly associated with an improved fill factor. Finally, we demonstrate a four-cell MA(0.7)FA(0.3)Pb(13) perovskite module with a stabilized power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.6% measured from an aperture area of similar to 10.36 cm(2), corresponding to an active-area module PCE of 17.9% with a geometric fill factor of 87.3%.

Here, we show how this clean semiconductor performance sets in during the earliest phase of conversion from the metal salts and organic-based precursors and solvent, using simultaneous in situ synchrotron X-ray and in operando current-voltage measurements on films prepared on interdigitated back-contact substrates. These structures function as working solar cells as soon as sufficient semiconductor material is present across the electrodes. We find that at the first stages of conversion from the precursor phase, at the percolation threshold for bulk conductance, high photovoltages are observed, even though the bulk of the material is still present as precursors. This indicates that at the earliest stages of perovskite structure formation, the semiconductor gap is already well-defined and free of sub-gap trap states. The short circuit current, in contrast, continues to grow until the perovskite phase is fully formed, when there are bulk pathways for charge diffusion and collection. This work reveals important relationships between the precursors conversion and device performance and highlights the remarkable defect tolerance of perovskite materials.

In particular, inorganic and hybrid perovskite materials undergo structural phase transitions associated with octahedral tilts of the metal-halide octahedra. We investigate the structural instabilities present in inorganic CsMX3 perovskites with Pb or Sn on the metal site and Br or I on the X site. Defining primary order parameters in terms of symmetry-adapted collective displacement modes and secondary order parameters in terms of symmetrized Hencky strain components, we unravel the coupling between octahedral tilt modes and macroscopic strains as well as the role of A-site displacements in perovskite phase stability. Symmetry-allowed secondary strain order parameters are enumerated for the 14 unique perovskite tilt systems. Using first-principles calculations to explore the Born-Oppenheimer energy surface in terms of symmetrized order parameters, we find coupling between octahedral tilting and A-site displacements is necessary to stabilize Pnma ground states. Additionally, we show that the relative stability of an inorganic halide perovskite tilt system correlates with the volume decrease from the high-symmetry cubic phase to the low-symmetry distorted phase.

Improved Stability of Organometal Halide Perovskite Films and Solar Cells toward Humidity via Surface Passivation with Oleic Acid	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						perovskite solar cell; humidity; surface passivation; oleic acid; stability	METHYLAMMONIUM LEAD IODIDE; DEGRADATION; EFFICIENT; RECOMBINATION; PHOTOVOLTAICS; TEMPERATURE; MOBILITIES; DYNAMICS; MOISTURE	Organometal halide (OMB) perovskites are highly promising for photovoltaic (PV) and other applications. However, their instability toward environmental factors such as humidity presents a major challenge in their potential commercial use. In this study, we developed a method to modify the surface of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films by spin coating oleic acid (OA) to create a water resistant layer that results in enhanced stability and PV performance. The OA-surface passivated perovskites were studied using FT-IR spectroscopy, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The samples were aged in dark humid air at similar to 76% relative humidity (RH) for 4 weeks. The surface passivated films showed minimal signs of decomposition, and the PV devices showed better performance than the unpassivated devices. A possible explanation is the carboxyl group (-COO-) of OA binds to surface Pb2+ and/or CH3NH3+ to both passivate these surface defect sites, resulting in the formation of a thin layer of OA with their hydrophobic tail away from the perovskite film surface that effectively prevents water molecules from reaching the perovskite.

Although the photovoltaics field has witnessed significant progress in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells, unveiling the contribution of the various factors (i.e., energy level alignment, trap states, electron (hole) mobility, interface interactions, and morphology) affecting the observed PCEs is extremely crucial to achieve reproducible and stable devices. This work aims to understand charge transport and recombination within conventional perovskite solar cells due to modifications of the morphology, optoelectronic properties, and energy levels of the titania electron transport layer. Here, we utilize two different processing methods (i.e., solution and sputtering depositions) to yield three morphologically different titania electron transport layers (i.e., planar bulk TiO2, mesoporous TiOx, and sputtered TiO2). We find that the most important factors affecting the PCEs in perovskite solar cells are related to trap-assisted recombination and energy level alignment due to variations in the electron transport layer/perovskite interface. Similarly, we observe that morphologies of both the electron transport layer and the perovskite active layer play a minor role on the observed PCEs.

Deposition of Methylammonium Lead Triiodide by Resonant Infrared Matrix-Assisted Pulsed Laser Evaporation	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	59th Electronic Materials Conference (EMC)	JUN 28-30, 2017	Univ Notre Dame, South Bend, IN		Univ Notre Dame	RIR-MAPLE; matrix-assisted pulsed laser evaporation; metal-halide perovskites; methylammonium lead iodide	PEROVSKITE SOLAR-CELLS; RIR-MAPLE DEPOSITION; HALIDE PEROVSKITE; FILMS; TRIHALIDE; IODIDE	Resonant infrared matrix-assisted pulsed laser evaporation (RIR-MAPLE) was used to deposit the metal-halide perovskite (MHP) CH3NH3PbI3 (methylammonium lead triiodide, or MAPbI), creating phase-pure films. Given the moisture sensitivity of these crystalline, multi-component organic-inorganic hybrid materials, deposition of MAPbI by RIR-MAPLE required a departure from the use of water-based emulsions as deposition targets. Different chemistries were explored to create targets that properly dissolved MAPbI components, were stable under vacuum conditions, and enabled resonant laser energy absorption. Secondary phases and solvent contamination in the resulting films were studied through Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) absorbance and x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, suggesting that lingering excess methylammonium iodide (MAI) and low-vapor pressure solvents can distort the microstructure, creating crystalline and amorphous non-perovskite phases. Thermal annealing of films deposited by RIR-MAPLE allowed for excess solvent to be evaporated from films without degrading the MAPbI structure. Further, it was demonstrated that RIR-MAPLE does not require excess MAI to create stoichiometric films with optoelectronic properties, crystal structure, and film morphology comparable to films created using more established spin-coating methods for processing MHPs. This work marks the first time a MAPLE-related technique was used to deposit MHPs.	[Barraza, E.

Atmospheric deposition and thermal processing of perovskite thin films for photovoltaic applications facilitated via rapid intense pulsed light (IPL) processing have been carried out. The interplay between the deposition chemistry, process, and IPL parameters to produce a functional photoactive thin film is discussed. Further addition of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as functional surfactant is explored to influence grain growth during the IPL process. Structural analysis by x-ray diffraction revealed formation of mixed-phase perovskite crystals from methylammonium chloride and lead iodide precursors. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy indicated that the light absorption by the perovskite films lay within a narrow band of the visible spectrum with bandgap of 2.9 eV. Scanning electron microscopy characterization of the surface morphology of the perovskite films revealed that addition of PVP to the ink chemistry assisted the IPL process in forming a fully covered surface with clearly defined grains. Functional devices with perovskite thin film processed by IPL under fully atmospheric conditions were demonstrated.

This is most often the case with thin film technologies, including perovskite cells, where the active layers are a few microns thick and can be sensitive to moisture, liquid water or both. When moisture or liquid water can ingress, a small amount of water can lead to corrosion and depending on the resulting reactions, a larger local detrimental effect is possible. To prevent moisture from contacting photovoltaic components, impermeable frontsheets and backsheets are used with a polyisobutylene (PIB)-based edge seal material around the perimeter. Here, we evaluate the ability of a PIB-based edge seal using a molecular sieve desiccant to keep moisture out for the expected module lifetime. Moisture ingress is evaluated using test coupons where the edge seal is placed between 2 pieces of glass, one of which has a metallic calcium film on it, and monitoring the moisture ingress distance as a function of time. We expose samples to different temperature and humidity conditions to create permeation models useful for extrapolation to field use. This extrapolation indicates that this PIB material is capable of keeping moisture out of a module for the desired lifetime.

In this paper, we investigate theoretically the effect of ferroelectricity on the redistribution of charge in a PCBM/perovskite device through the Poisson equation. The spontaneous polarization is set to be a hyperbolic tangent function of applied electrical field. The carriers in both the layers are assumed to be in quasi-equilibrium, and the (dark) current stems from the recombination at the PCBM/perovskite interface. The electrostatic potential profiles throughout the device and the current-bias (I - V) curves are obtained numerically. It is found that for the bias forward scan, larger potential drop will be on the PCBM layer, and for the bias reverse scan larger potential drop will be on the perovskite layer. The hysteresis of I - V curves is also obtained. These results shed new light on the effect of ferroelectricity in hybrid perovskite materials.

Oxygen-induced defects at the lead halide perovskite/graphene oxide interfaces	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							REDUCED GRAPHENE OXIDE; SOLAR-CELLS; HIGHLY EFFICIENT; PHOTOVOLTAIC EFFICIENCY; STABILITY ENHANCEMENT; CH3NH3PBI3 PEROVSKITE; ELECTRON EXTRACTION; IODIDE; REDUCTION; EVOLUTION	Graphene oxide or its reduced derivative (GO/RGO) replace metal oxides in perovskite photovoltaics to achieve energy band alignment for minimization of the energy barriers at the film interfaces allowing efficient charge transport, and eliminate stability issues. However, the power conversion efficiencies fall in a wide range (similar to 0.6-18%). Therefore, the perovskite growth and nucleation on GO/RGO require fundamental understanding to improve device function for controlled fabrication, which remain a major challenge. We analyze the surface morphology and crystallization of the lead halide perovskites (MAPbX(3)) at 20-300 degrees C on GO using X-ray diffraction and photoelectron spectroscopy. To determine defect mechanisms and their composition, we perform in situ transmission infrared and micro Raman spectroscopy, and the cross-sectional scanning microscopy that captures interfacial imperfections with the oxygen defects. We demonstrate the oxygen-induced defects at the MAPbX(3)/GO interfaces that initiate at room temperature, and occur through the nucleophilic substitution reactions. Unexpectedly, structural defects nucleate in GO forming chemically reduced GO, and modify the surface morphology that yield a poor perovskite growth. Our theoretical studies also reveal that energetically favorable, exothermic reactions between the halides of the perovskite precursors and the oxygen groups of GO generate acidic reaction by-products (i.e. HX), that confirm the formation of oxygen-induced defects.

However, poor film quality has limited device performance. In this work, we developed a solvent-engineering method and show that it is applicable to several bismuth-based compounds. Through this method, we obtained compact films of methylammonium bismuth iodide (MBI), cesium bismuth iodide (CBI), and formamidinium bismuth iodide (FBI). On the basis of film growth theory and experimental analyses, we propose a possible mechanism of film formation. Additionally, we demonstrate that the resultant compact MBI film is more suitable to fabricate efficient and stable photovoltaic devices compared to baseline MBI films with pinholes. We further employed a new hole-transporting material to reduce the valence-band offset with the MBI. The best-performing photovoltaic device exhibits an open-circuit voltage of 0.85 V, fill factor of 73%, and a power conversion efficiency of 0.71%, the highest reported values for MBI-based photovoltaic devices.

Such high performance can be attributed to the unique properties of perovskite materials, such as high absorption over the visible range and long diffusion length. Due to the different diffusion lengths of holes and electrons, electron transporting materials (ETMs) used in PSCs play a critical role in PSCs performance. As an alternative to TiO2 ETM, ZnO materials have similar physical properties to TiO2 but with much higher electron mobility. In addition, there are many simple and facile methods to fabricate ZnO nanomaterials with low cost and energy consumption. This review focuses on recent developments in the use of ZnO ETM for PSCs. The fabrication methods of ZnO materials are briefly introduced. The influence of different ZnO ETMs on performance of PSCs is then reviewed. The limitations of ZnO ETM-based PSCs and some solutions to these challenges are also discussed. The review provides a systematic and comprehensive understanding of the influence of different ZnO ETMs on PSCs performance and potentially motivates further development of PSCs by extending the knowledge of ZnO-based PSCs to TiO2-based PSCs.

However, continuous-wave (CW) lasing, necessary for many optoelectronic applications, has not been achieved to date. This is thought to be due to many-body screening, which reduces the excitonic resonance enhancement of the oscillator strength at high excitation densities necessary for population inversion. Here CW lasing in CsPbBr3 perovskite NWs is reported. Analysis of the cavity modes and their temperature dependence reveals that both CW and pulsed lasing originate from polariton modes near the bottleneck region on the lower polariton branch, with a vacuum Rabi splitting of 0.20 +/- 0.03 eV. These findings suggest that lead halide perovskite NWs may serve as low-power CW coherent light sources and as model systems for polaritonics in the strong-coupling regime.	[Evans, Tyler J.

Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by All-Crosslinked Charge-Transporting Layers	JOULE			English	Article							INDUCED ELECTRON-TRANSFER; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; STABILITY; POLYMER; DEGRADATION; PERFORMANCE; LINKING; DERIVATIVES; FULLERENES; REDUCTION	Despite the demonstrated high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PVSC), long-term stability of the device operated in humid environments under photo- and thermal stresses is still a serious concern prior to any commercialization. To provide possible solutions to overcome this hurdle, we have synthesized an n-type conjugated molecule, c-HATNA, that can be crosslinked as an electron-transporting layer (ETL) on top of the desired perovskites. By proper doping to increase its electron-transporting property, a high PCE of 18.21% can be obtained with respectable moisture and thermal stability without encapsulation. Moreover, this c-HATNA ETL can be used in conjunction with another crosslinkable hole-transporting layer, c-TCTA-BVP, to fabricate all-crosslinked charge-transporting layers (CTLs) for PVSCs and achieve 16.08% and 13.42% PCEs on rigid and flexible substrates, respectively. More importantly, the device with all-crosslinked CTLs showed impressive thermal stability in ambient environment: almost 70% of its initial PCE after being heated at 70 degrees C for 300 hr.

Crossing Up Charge Extraction Layers	JOULE			English	Article							EFFICIENT	Photovoltaics based on low-temperature processed thin films are a promising technology for inexpensive renewable energy. The efficiency of thin-film solar cells is greatly influenced by the design of the materials that extract charge from the light-absorbing layer. These charge extraction layers are additionally a critical determinant of device stability. In this issue of Joule, Zhu and colleagues have developed crosslinked molecular charge extraction layers that enhance the environmental, thermal, and photo-stability of thin-film perovskite photovoltaics.

The performance parameters of the PHJ-PSCs showed soaring enhancement after employing W-PEDOT: PSS or I-PEDOT: PSS instead of pristine PEDOT:PSS (P-PEDOT:PSS), resulting in an increase of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of W-PEDOT:PSS-based PHJ-PSCs to 15.60% from 11.95% for P-PEDOT: PSS-based PHJ-PSCs. The performance improvement results from two aspects. On the one hand, as compared to P-PEDOT:PSS, the occupied molecular orbital energy (HOMO) level of dilute PEDOT:PSS showed an impressive decrease and can well match the valence band of CH3NH3PbI3 film, resulting in less energy loss and a significant improvement in the open-circuit voltage (Voc). On the other hand, the dilute PEDOT:PSS could produce a thinner film as compared with the P-PEDOT: PSS, which also played an important role in the performance of the PHJ-PSCs. Furthermore, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results indicated that the interface between perovskite and PEDOT:PSS was greatly improved by employing W-PEDOT:PSS or I-PEDOT:PSS, leading to an obvious decrease in the series resistance (Rs) and an increase in the recombination resistance (Rrec). The research demonstrated that diluting PEDOT:PSS with a common solvent, such as H2O and IPA, is a feasible low-temperature way of achieving efficient PHJ-PSCs.

A transfer matrix model is used to separate electronic losses from optical losses in the form of parasitic absorption. It is reported that MAPbI(3-x)Cl(x) is the superior absorber due to increased crystallinity, but that the benefit from using the chloride-assisted formulation is negated when the absorber is deposited on a mesoporous substrate. It is also reported that some beneficial electronic and optical effects are associated with the mesoporous TiO2: decreased parasitic absorption at short wavelengths and possible enhancement of charge transfer; the overall use of the mesoporous scaffold typically seen in dye-sensitized solar cells is not appropriate for perovskite-sensitized solar cells, where it disrupts the formation of large perovskite grains. The analysis also provides important insight into the application of transfer matrix modeling in pseudoplanar systems such as the ubiquitous mesoporous solar cell architecture.

PSC devices using HTLs deposited on a hot substrate show improvement in the open-circuit voltage (V-oc) from 1.041 to 1.070 V and the PCE from 17.00% to 18.01%. The overall device performance is then further enhanced with the hot substrate deposition of ETLs as the V-oc and PCE reach 1.105 V and 19.16%, respectively. The improved performance can be explained by the decreased current leakage and series resistance, which are present in PSCs with rough and discontinuous HTLs and ETLs.

The Importance of Pendant Groups on Triphenylamine-Based Hole Transport Materials for Obtaining Perovskite Solar Cells with over 20% Efficiency	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						high efficiency; hole transport materials; perovskites; photovoltaic devices; solar cells	HIGHLY EFFICIENT; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; LOW-COST; RATIONAL DESIGN; SPIRO-OMETAD; THIN-FILM; CARBAZOLE; DERIVATIVES; TRIHALIDE; LAYERS	Tremendous progress has recently been achieved in the field of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as evidenced by impressive power conversion efficiencies (PCEs); but the high PCEs of >20% in PSCs has so far been mostly achieved by using the hole transport material (HTM) spiro-OMeTAD; however, the relatively low conductivity and high cost of spiro-OMeTAD significantly limit its potential use in large-scale applications. In this work, two new organic molecules with spiro[fluorene-9,9-xanthene] (SFX)-based pendant groups, X26 and X36, have been developed as HTMs. Both X26 and X36 present facile syntheses with high yields. It is found that the introduced SFX pendant groups in triphenylamine-based molecules show significant influence on the conductivity, energy levels, and thin-film surface morphology. The use of X26 as HTM in PSCs yields a remarkable PCE of 20.2%. In addition, the X26-based devices show impressive stability maintaining a high PCE of 18.8% after 5 months of aging in controlled (20%) humidity in the dark. We believe that X26 with high device PCEs of >20% and simple synthesis show a great promise for future application in PSCs, and that it represents a useful design platform for designing new charge transport materials for optoelectronic applications.

The data are consistent with a transition from cubic Pm (3) over barm (No. 221) to tetragonal P4/mbm (No. 127) for both materials upon cooling; this occurs for FAPbBr3 between 275 and 250 K, and for FASnI3 between 250 and 225 K. Upon further cooling, between 150 and 125 K, both materials undergo a transition to an orthorhombic Pnma (No. 62) structure. The transitions are confirmed by calorimetry and dielectric measurements. In the tetragonal regime, the coefficients of volumetric thermal expansion of FASnI(3) and FAPbBr(3) are among the highest recorded for any extended inorganic crystalline solid, reaching 219 ppm K-1 for FASnI(3) at 225 K. Atomic displacement parameters of all atoms for both materials suggest dynamic motion is occurring in the inorganic sublattice due to the flexibility of the inorganic network and dynamic lone pair stereochemical activity on the B-site. Unusual pseudocubic behavior is displayed in the tetragonal phase of the FAPbBr(3), similar to that previously observed in FAPbI(3).

Room-temperature fabrication of a delafossite CuCrO2 hole transport layer for perovskite solar cells	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							COPPER(I) CHROMIUM(III) OXIDE; TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; EFFICIENCY; DEGRADATION; PERFORMANCE; CHEMISTRY; MIGRATION; CUOX	Delafossite oxides are promising hole transport layer (HTL) candidates for perovskite solar cells, due to their wide band gap, favorable energy band alignment relative to the perovskite absorber and simplicity of processing. In this paper, we investigate the properties of CuCrO2 (CCO) delafossite films using an integration of experimental and computational techniques. Phase-pure CCO films are deposited at room temperature by spin-casting suspensions of hydrothermally-synthesized nanoparticles, for use in a glass/ITO/CCO/CH(3)NH(3)Pbl(3)/C-60/BCP/Ag device structure. Although density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict an elevated hole effective mass along certain crystallographic directions, the nearly isotropic shape and small size of the CCO nanoparticles preserves transport properties within the films by randomizing particle orientation, preventing these unfavorable directions from dominating the film conductivity. Experimental measurements confirm that the CCO films display appropriate optical and electrical properties for use as an HTL, in good agreement with the DFT calculations. Solar cells made using these films exhibit stabilized power conversion efficiencies exceeding 14%, with only minor hysteresis in the current-voltage characteristics.

One of the most plausible arguments for their high efficiency is the ability of organic cations to form ferroelectric (FE) domains. By using first-principles calculations to examine the rotational behavior of MA cations in MAPbI(3), here we show a relationship between the lattice structures and the FE dipole ordering of MA cations. It is FE found that the MA cations could form a spontaneous FE dipole ordering in tetragonal MAPbI(3) at room temperature. The tendency of the FE formation is strongly related to the ratio of lattice parameters of MAPbI(3). On the basis of the developed structure-ferroelectric-property relationship, we propose that a biaxial or uniaxial compressive strain and an anion doping with small halogen ions can finther enhance the FE dipole ordering. These findings are in good agreement with the experimental discoveries that high-performance solar cells always incorporate mixed halide hybrid perovskites involving Br or CI ions. This work may provide some guidelines for rational designs of highly efficient hybrid perovskite solar cells.

Modulation of Charge Recombination in CsPbBr3 Perovskite Films with Electrochemical Bias	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							LEAD HALIDE PEROVSKITE; ORGANOMETAL TRIHALIDE PEROVSKITE; BAND-EDGE ENERGIES; SOLAR-CELLS; NANOCRYSTALS; ELECTRON; DIFFUSION; EMISSION; IODIDE; SEGREGATION	The charging of a mesoscopic TiO2 layer in a metal halide perovskite solar cell can influence the overall power conversion efficiency. By employing CsPbBr3 films deposited on a mesoscopic TiO2 film, we have succeeded in probing the influence of electrochemical bias on the charge carrier recombination process. The transient absorption spectroscopy experiments conducted at different applied potentials indicate a decrease in the charge carrier lifetimes of CsPbBr3 as we increase the potential from -0.6 to +0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl. The charge carrier lifetime increased upon reversing the applied bias, thus indicating the reversibility of the photoresponse to charging effects. The ultrafast spectroelectrochemical experiments described here offer a convenient approach to probe the charging effects in perovskite solar cells.

Dopant-Free Tetrakis-Triphenylamine Hole Transporting Material for Efficient Tin-Based Perovskite Solar Cells	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							HALIDE PEROVSKITES; LAYER; FABRICATION; CATIONS	Developing dopant-free hole transporting layers (HTLs) is critical in achieving high-performance and robust state-of-the-art perovskite photovoltaics, especially for the air-sensitive tin-based perovskite systems. The commonly used HTLs require hygroscopic dopants and additives for optimal performance, which adds extra cost to manufacturing and limits long-term device stability. Here we demonstrate the use of a novel tetrakistriphenylamine (TPE) small molecule prepared by a facile synthetic route as a superior dopant-free HTL for lead-free tin-based perovskite solar cells. The best-performing tin iodide perovskite cells employing the novel mixed-cation ethylenediammonium/formamidinium with the dopant-free TPE HTL achieve a power conversion efficiency as high as 7.23%, ascribed to the HTL's suitable band alignment and excellent hole extraction/collection properties. This efficiency is one of the highest reported so far for tin halide perovskite systems, highlighting potential application of TPE HTL material in low-cost high-performance tin-based perovskite solar cells.

Pseudohalide-Induced Recrystallization Engineering for CH3NH3PbI3 Film and Its Application in Highly Efficient Inverted Planar Heterojunction Perovskite Solar Cells	ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS			English	Article						flexible solar cells; interfacial engineering; perovskite solar cells; pseudohalide; recrystallization	EFFECTIVE IONIC-RADII; PERFORMANCE; HYSTERESIS; DEPOSITION; CHEMISTRY	High crystallinity and compactness of the active layer is essential for metal-halide perovskite solar cells. Here, a simple pseudohalide-induced film retreatment technology is developed as the passivation for preformed perovskite film. It is found that the retreatment process yields a controllable decomposition-to-recrystallization evolution of the perovskite film. Corresponding, it remarkably enlarges the grain size of the film in all directions, as well as improving the crystallinity and hindering the trap density. Meanwhile, owing to an intermediate catalytic effect of the pseudohalide compound (NH4SCN), no crystal orientation changing and no impurity introduction in the modified film. By integrating the modified perovskite film into the planar heterojunction solar cells, a champion power conversion efficiency of 19.44% with a stabilized output efficiency of 19.02% under 1 sun illumination is obtained, exhibiting a negligible current density-voltage hysteresis. Moreover, such a facile and low-temperature film retreatment approach guarantees the application in flexible devices, showing a best power conversion efficiency of 17.04%.

Interestingly, AmbP3 also accepts hapalindole A, a halogenated C-10 epimer of hapalindole U, and catalyzes normal prenylation at its C-2 position. The comparison of the two ternary crystal structures, AmbP3-DMSPP/ hapalindoleU and AmbP3-DMSPP/hapalindole A, at 1.65-2.00 angstrom resolution revealed two distinct orientations for the substrate binding that define reverse or normal prenylation. The tolerance of the enzyme for these altered orientations is attributed to the hydrophobicity of the substrate binding pocket and the plasticity of the amino acids surrounding the allyl group of the prenyl donor. This is the first study to provide the intimate structural basis for the normal and reverse prenylations catalyzed by a single enzyme, and it offers novel insight into the engineered biosynthesis of prenylated natural products.

Understanding Film Formation Morphology and Orientation in High Member 2D Ruddlesden-Popper Perovskites for High-Efficiency Solar Cells	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						2D perovskites; microstructure; solar cells; thin films	HOLE EXTRACTION LAYERS; DEGRADATION; PERFORMANCE; STABILITY; STATE; CS	2D Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) perovskites have recently emerged as promising candidates for hybrid perovskite photovoltaic cells, realizing power-conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 10% with technologically relevant stability. To achieve solar cell performance comparable to the state-of-the-art 3D perovskite cells, it is highly desirable to increase the conductivity and lower the optical bandgap for enhanced near-IR region absorption by increasing the perovskite slab thickness. Here, the use of the 2D higher member (n = 5) RP perovskite (n-butyl-NH3)(2)(MeNH3)(4)Pb5I16 in depositing highly oriented thin films from dimethylformamide/dimethylsulfoxide mixtures using the hot-casting method is reported. In addition, they exhibit superior environmental stability over thin films of their 3D counterpart. These films are assembled into high-efficiency solar cells with an open-circuit voltage of approximate to 1 V and PCE of up to 10%. This is achieved by fine-tuning the solvent ratio, crystal growth orientation, and grain size in the thin films. The enhanced performance of the optimized devices is ascribed to the growth of micrometer-sized grains as opposed to more typically obtained nanometer grain size and highly crystalline, densely packed microstructures with the majority of the inorganic slabs preferentially aligned out of plane to the substrate, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction and grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering mapping.

Here, TiO2 shell coated CsPbBr3 core/shell NCs are synthesized through the encapsulation of colloidal CsPbBr3 NCs with titanium precursor, followed by calcination at 300 degrees C. The nearly monodispersed CsPbBr3/TiO2 core/shell NCs show excellent water stability for at least three months with the size, structure, morphology, and optical properties remaining identical, which represent the most water-stable inorganic shell passivated perovskite NCs reported to date. In addition, TiO2 shell coating can effectively suppress anion exchange and photodegradation, therefore dramatically improving the chemical stability and photostability of the core CsPbBr3 NCs. More importantly, photoluminescence and (photo)electrochemical characterizations exhibit increased charge separation efficiency due to the electrical conductivity of the TiO2 shell, hence leading to an improved photoelectric activity in water. This study opens new possibilities for optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications of perovskites-based NCs in aqueous phase.

We find that the volume scaling of the biexciton Auger rate in the hybrid perovskites, containing a polar organic A-site cation, is significantly shallower than in the fully inorganic Cs-based nanocrystals. As the nanocrystals become smaller, the Auger rate in the hybrid nanocrystals increases even less than expected, compared to the fully inorganic nanocrystals, which already show a shallower volume dependence than other material systems such as chalcogenide quantum dots. This finding suggests there may be differences in the strength of Coulombic interactions between the fully inorganic and hybrid perovskites, which may prove to be crucial in selecting materials to obtain the highest performing devices in the future, and hints that there could be something "special" about the hybrid materials.

Here, we show, through density functional theory calculations, that Tl-Bi and In-Bi bromide double perovskites exhibit significantly different semiconducting behaviors due to the different energy levels of the highest-occupied pseudoclosed s(2) orbitals of Tl(I) and In(I). While Tl-Bi double perovskites can exhibit semiconducting p-type properties, In-Bi bromide double perovskites exhibit metallic p-type ones regardless of the synthesis condition due to the extremely low formation energy of In vacancy. Such difference makes Tl-Bi bromide double perovskites suitable for optoelectronic applications, but not In-Bi bromide double perovskites. Furthermore, there is a high probability for In to substitute a Bi site, forming a local In-In bromide double perovskite structure with a lower local conduction band minimum, detrimentally affecting the open circuit voltage of In-Bi bromide double perovskite-based thin film solar cells.

Structures of a Complex Hydrazinium Lead Iodide, (N2H5)(15)Pb3I21, Possessing [Pb2I9](5-), [PbI6](4-), and I- Ions and alpha- and beta-(N2H5)PbI3	CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL			English	Article						hydrazinium; hydrogen bonding; lead; perovskite; structure elucidation	ORGANIC-INORGANIC PEROVSKITES; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; SOLAR-CELLS; EFFICIENCY; SPECTRUM	Photovoltaic perovskites, most notably methylammonium lead triiodide, (NH3Me)PbI3, have recently attracted considerable attention, and based upon the modified "Goldschmidt" as well as a "revised" tolerance factors, hydrazinium should be able to occupy the same cation site as methylammonium, and form a cubic unit cell. The reaction of N2H5+I- with PbI2 in dimethylformamide results in three types of yellow crystals; hexagonal, needle-like, and rod-like, the structures of which were determined at 100K. The hexagonal (P6(3)/m: a=10.8906(10)angstrom; b=37.845(5)angstrom) crystals possess isolated face-sharing octahedral [Pb2I9](5-), [PbI6](4-), and I- ions. IR spectroscopy indicates the presence of hydrogen-bonded N2H5+ and the composition was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, density measurements, combustion elemental analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis to be (N2H5)(15)Pb3I21, which is photoluminescent at 50K, but not at room temperature. The needle and rod crystals have an orthorhombic (Pnma: a=11.1385(7)angstrom; b=4.4806(3)angstrom; c=17.6241(11)angstrom) and hexagonal (P6(3)/mmc: a=8.7386(9)angstrom; b=8.2006(9)angstrom) unit cells, respectively, possessing the perovskite ABX(3) composition of (N2H5)PbI3, but neither exhibits the cubic Perovskite structure type. The structures of - and -(N2H5)PbI3 possess parallel ribbons of Pb2I4 and chains of PbI2, respectively. Strong inter-hydrazinium hydrogen bonding due to it possessing both hydrogen bonding donor and acceptor sites (unlike NH3Me+) appear to stabilize the observed extended ribbon motif for (N2H5)(15)Pb3I21 and -(N2H5)PbI3. (N2H5)(15)Pb3I21 has a band-gap-like absorption of 2.34eV, and both alpha- and beta-(N2H5)PbI3 have a 2.70 eV band-gap-like absorptions.

ON THE ORIGIN OF SPATIALLY DEPENDENT ELECTRONIC EXCITED-STATE DYNAMICS IN MIXED HYBRID PEROVSKITE THIN FILMS	LITHUANIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS			English	Article						transient absorption microscopy; ultrafast electronic excited-state dynamics; Auger recombination; metal halide perovskites	CHARGE-CARRIER DYNAMICS; AUGER RECOMBINATION; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; SOLAR-CELLS; MOBILITIES; SEPARATION; DIFFUSION; ENERGY	The fundamental photophysics underlying the remarkable performance of organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites in optoelectronic device applications has been increasingly studied using complementary spectroscopic techniques. However, the spatially heterogeneous polycrystalline morphology of the solution-processed thin films is often overlooked in conventional ensemble measurements and therefore the reported results are averaged over hundreds or even thousands of nano- and micro-crystalline grains. Here, we apply femtosecond transient absorption microscopy to spatially and temporally probe ultrafast electronic excited-state dynamics in chloride containing mixed lead halide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3-xClx) thin films. We found that the electronic excited-state relaxation kinetics are extremely sensitive to the spatial location probed, which was manifested by position-dependent transient absorption signal amplitude and decay behaviour, along with an obvious rise component at some positions. The analysis of transient absorption kinetics acquired at several distinct spatial positions enabled us to identify Auger recombination as the dominant mechanism underlying the initial portions of the spatially dependent dynamics with variable rate constants. The different rates observed suggest occurrence of distinct local electronic structures and variable contributions from impurities/defects and phonons in this nonlinear dynamical process.

Preliminary biological experiments show the potential activity of the compound containing a curcumin addend, which exhibits moderate anti-HIV-1 and radical scavenger properties, but no anti-cancer activity.

J	Cui, QH; Bazar, GC				Cui, Qiuhong; Bazar, Guillermo C.			Narrow Band Gap Conjugated Polyelectrolytes	ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH			English	Review							POLYMER SOLAR-CELLS; LIGHT-EMITTING-DIODES; CARBON NANOTUBE COMPOSITES; INDIUM-TIN-OXIDE; ELECTRONIC-PROPERTIES; CONDUCTING POLYMERS; CHARGE-TRANSPORT; EFFICIENCY; THERMOELECTRICS; PERFORMANCE	Two essential structural elements define a class of materials called conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs). The first is a polymer framework with an electronically delocalized, pi-conjugated structure. This component allows one to adjust desirable optical and electronic properties, for example the range of wavelengths absorbed, emission quantum yields, electron affinity, and ionization potential. The second-defining feature is the presence of ionic functionalities, which are usually linked via tethers that can modulate the distance of the charged groups relative to the backbone. These ionic groups render CPEs distinct relative to their neutral conjugated polymer counterparts. Solubility in polar solvents, including aqueous media, is an immediately obvious difference. This feature has enabled the development of optically amplified biosensor protocols and the fabrication of multilayer organic semiconductor devices through deposition techniques using solvents with orthogonal properties. Important but less obvious potential advantages must also be considered. For example, CPE layers have been used to introduce interfacial dipoles and thus modify the effective work function of adjacent electrodes. One can thereby modulate the barriers for charge injection into semiconductor layers and improve the device efficiencies of organic light-emitting diodes and solar cells. With a hydrophobic backbone and hydrophilic ionic sites, CPEs can also be used as dispersants for insoluble materials. Narrow band gap CPEs (NBGCPEs) have been studied only recently. They contain backbones that comprise electron-rich and electron-poor fragments, a combination that leads to intramolecular charge transfer excited states and enables facile oxidation and reduction. One particularly interesting combination is NBGCPEs with anionic sulfonate side groups, for which spontaneous self doping in aqueous media is observed. That no such doping is observed with cationic NBGCPEs indicates that the interplay between electrostatic forces and the redox chemistry of the organic semiconducting chain is essential for stabilizing the polaronic States and increasing the conductivity of the bulk. Capitalizing upon the properties of NBGCPEs has resulted in a range of new applications. When doped, they can be introduced as interlayers in organic and perovskite solar cells. Single-walled carbon nanotubes can be n- or p-doped with NBGCPEs, depending on whether the same backbone contains attached cationic or anionic side groups, respectively. The resulting dispersions can be used to fabricate flexible thermoelectric devices in which the n- and p-semiconductor legs are nearly identical in terms of chemical composition. Electrostatic interactions with negatively charged cell walls, in combination with the long-wavelength absorption and high photothermal efficiencies, have been used to create effective agents for photothermal killing of bacteria. Additionally, recent results have shown that cationic NBGCPEs can effectively n-dope graphene and that this doping is temperature-dependent. The preferential charge carriers can therefore be chosen to be electrons or holes depending on the applied temperature.

Most advances focus on the improvement of the heterojunction, in which nonperovskite materials are employed at the pertaining interfaces. Herein we demonstrate the modification of perovskite absorber by incorporation of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, which is congeneric to the absorber in terms of crystal structure and stoichiometry. It led to significant enhancement in photovoltaic performance in the corresponding devices, which was mainly attributed to the improved carrier dynamics over the resultant heterojunction. Therefore, a different strategy is suggested for further improvement of the perovskite heterojunction by using congeneric materials.

Intriguing aspects include sizable carrier diffusion lengths, large optical absorption coefficients, and certified power conversion efficiencies that now exceed 22%. Halide-composition-tunable band gaps also make MAPb(I1-x,Br-x)(3) systems ideal candidates for tandem solar cells. Unfortunately, preventing the effective integration of MAPb(I1-xBrx)(3) into working devices are intrinsic instabilities due to light-induced halide phase segregation. Namely, under illumination, mixed halide perovskites reversibly segregate into low-band-gap I-rich and high-band-gap Br-rich domains. Under electrical bias, halide migration has also been proposed as the source of undesirable charge injection barriers that degrade photovoltaic performance. In this Perspective, we review the origin of light-induced halide phase segregation, its effects on photovoltaic response, and ongoing research to suppress its influence on the optical and electronic response of mixed halide perovskites.

It is found that the VOX:yCs (where y is the mole ratio of Cs versus V and y = 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5) thin films possess better electrical conductivities than that of the pristine VOX thin film. As a result, the PSCs incorporated with the VOX: yCs HEL exhibit large fill factors and high short-circuit currents, with consequently high power conversion efficiencies, which is more than 30% enhancement as compared with pristine VOX HEL. Our studies provide a facial way to enhance the electrical conductivity of the hole extraction layer for boosting device performance of perovskite solar cells.

In the typical PSC device architecture, hole transport materials that can effectively extract and transmit holes from the active layer to the counter electrode (HTMs) are indispensable. The well-known small molecule 2,2',7,7'-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxy-phenyl amino)-9,9'-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) is the best choice for optimal perovskite device performance. Nevertheless, there is a consensus that spiro-OMeTAD by itself is not stable enough for long-term use in devices due to the sophisticated oxidation process associated with undesired ion migration/interactions. It has been found that spiro-OMeTAD can significantly contribute to the overall cost of materials required for the PSC manufacturing, thus its market price makes its use in large-scale production costly. Besides, another main drawback of spiro-OMeTAD is its poor reproducibility. To engineer HTMs that are considerably cheaper and more reproducible than spiro-OMeTAD, shorter reaction schemes with simple purification procedures are required. Furthermore, HTMs must possess a number of other qualities, including excellent charge transporting properties, good energy matching with the perovskite, transparency to solar radiation, a large Stokes shift, good solubility in organic solvents, morphologically stable film formation, and others. To date, hundreds of new organic semiconductor molecules have been synthesized for use as HTMs in perovskite solar cells. Successful examples include azomethine derivatives, branched methoxydiphenylamine-substituted fluorine derivatives, enamine derivatives, and many others. Some of these have been incorporated as HTMs in complete, functional PSCs capable of matching the performance of the best-performing PSCs prepared using spiro-OMeTAD while showing even better stability. In light of these results, we describe the advances made in the synthesis of HTMs that have been tested in perovskite solar cells, and give an overview of the molecular engineering of HTMs. Meanwhile, we highlight the effects of molecular structure on PCE and device stability of PSCs. This review is organized as follows. In the first part, we give a general introduction to the development of PSCs. In the second part, we focus on the introduction of the perovskite structure, device architecture, and relevant work principles in detail. In the third part, we discuss all kinds of molecular HTMs applied in PSCs. Special emphasis is placed on the relationship between HTM molecular structure and device function. Last but not least, we point out some existing challenges, suggest possible routes for further HTM design, and provide some conclusions.

Low-temperature, planar PSCs are of particularly interest for large-scale deployment due to their inherent suitability for flexible substrates and potential for silicon/perovskite tandems. So far, planar PSCs have been prone to large current-voltage hysteresis and low stabilized power output due to a number of issues associated with this kind of device configuration. We find that the suppression of the yellow-phase impurity (partial derivative-FAPbI(3)) present in formamidium-based perovskites, by RbI addition, contributes to low hysteresis, higher charge carrier mobility, long-lived carrier lifetimes and a champion stabilized power output of 20.3% using SnOx as the electron selective contact. We study the effects of these impurities on the transient behavior that defines hysteresis and its relation to ionic movement. In addition, we find that the formation of a RbPbI3 phase does not significantly affect the charge carrier lifetimes and consequently the performance of the devices. This brings new physical insights onto the role of different impurities in perovskite solar cells, which make these materials so remarkable.

Design and understanding of encapsulated perovskite solar cells to withstand temperature cycling	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							THERMAL-EXPANSION; ADHESION; DEGRADATION; TRANSITION	The performance of perovskite solar cells has rapidly increased above 22%, and their environmental stability is also progressing. However, the mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients and low fracture energy of layers in perovskite solar cells raise a concern as to whether devices can withstand mechanical stresses from temperature fluctuations. We measured the fracture energy of a perovskite film stack, which was shown to produce 23.6% efficiency when incorporated in a monolithic perovskite-silicon tandem. We found that the fracture energy increased by a factor of two after 250 standardized temperature cycles between -40 degrees C and 85 degrees C and a factor of four after laminating an encapsulant on top of the stack. In order to observe how the increased mechanical stability translated from film stacks to device performance and reliability, we carried out a comparative study of perovskite solar cells packaged between glass and two commonly used encapsulants with different elastic moduli. We demonstrated that solar cells encapsulated with a stiffer ionomer, Surlyn, severely decreased in performance with temperature cycling and delaminated. However, the solar cells encapsulated in softer ethylene vinyl acetate withstood temperature cycling and retained over 90% of their initial performance after 200 temperature cycles. This work demonstrates a need for an encapsulant with a low elastic modulus to enable mechanical stability and progress toward 25 year operating lifetime.

At the same time, they are suitable for high-throughput manufacturing characterized by a low energy input and abundant low-cost materials. However, a further optimization of their efficiency, stability and reliability demands a more detailed optoelectronic characterization and understanding of losses including their evolution with time. In this work, we analyze perovskite solar cells with different architectures (planar, mesoporous, HTL-free), employing temperature dependent measurements (current-voltage, light intensity, electroluminescence) of the ideality factor to identify dominating recombination processes that limit the open-circuit voltage (V-oc). We find that in thoroughly-optimized, high-V-oc (approximate to 1.2 V) devices recombination prevails through defects in the perovskite. On the other hand, irreversible degradation at elevated temperature is caused by the introduction of broad tail states originating from an external source (e.g. metal electrode). Light-soaking is another effect decreasing performance, though reversibly. Based on FTPS measurements, this degradation is attributed to the generation of surface defects becoming a new source of non-radiative recombination. We conclude that improving long-term stability needs to focus on adjacent layers, whereas a further optimization of efficiency of top-performing devices requires understanding of the defect physics of the nanocrystalline perovskite absorber. Finally, our work provides guidelines for the design of further dedicated studies to correctly interpret the diode ideality factor and decrease recombination losses.

In this work, Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) is utilized to characterize the surface potential (SP) distribution on the cross-sectional surface of planar PSCs. Devices with regular structure Indium Tin Oxide (ITO)/ZnO/perovskite/2,2',7,-7'-tetrakis(N, N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)- 9,9'-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD)/Au and inverted structure Fluorine doped Tin Oxide (FTO)/nickel oxide (NiOx)/perovskite/ZnO/Ag are studied. The analysis of KPFM measurement indicates that, while p-n junction forms at the perovskite/ZnO interface in regular planar PSCs, p-i-n junction exists in inverted planar PSCswith electric field peaks at perovskite/NiOx and perovskite/ZnO interfaces. In addition, charge injection barriers in planar PSCs are revealed with relative SP profiles obtained under different biases. In regular PSCs, charge injection barriers are only observed at the perovskite/ZnO interface and the contact between perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD is an ideal ohmic contact, while in inverted PSCs, charge injection barriers are observed at both perovskite/ZnO and perovskite/NiOx contacts. The appearance of additional charge injection barriers in inverted PSCs exacerbates the charge recombination in these devices and leads to their relatively low open-circuit voltages. Our result indicates that the inefficient charge extraction is a major problem affecting the performance of planar PSCs.

Herein we report a new solution-based synthesis of stabilized Cs4PbBr6 perovskite particles with high luminescence. This method requires only mild conditions and produces colloidal particles that are ideal for highly efficient solution-based device fabrications. The synthesized microstructures not only display outstanding luminescence quantum yield but also long term stability in atmospheric conditions. Partial halide substitutions were also demonstrated to extend photoluminescence spectra of the perovskite particles. This convenient synthesis and optical tunability of Cs4PbBr6 perovskite particles will be advantageous for future applications of optoelectronic advices.

Identification of Defect Levels in Copper Indium Diselenide (CuInSe2) Thin Films via Photoluminescence Studies	MRS ADVANCES			English	Article								Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy has been used to study the defect levels in thin film copper indium diselenide (CuInSe2, CIS) which we are developing as the absorber layer for the bottom cell of a monolithically grown perovskite/CuInSe2 tandem solar cell. Temperature and laser power dependent PL measurements of thin film CIS for two different Cu/In ratios (0.66 and 0.80) have been performed The CIS film with Cu/In = 0.80 shows a prominent donor-to-acceptor peak (DAP) involving a shallow acceptor of binding energy similar to 22 meV, with phonon replica at similar to 32 meV spacing. In contrast, PL measurement of CIS film for Cu In = 0.66 taken at 20 K exhibited an asymmetric and broad PL spectrum with peaks at 0.845 eV and 0.787 eV. Laser intensity dependent PL revealed that the observed peaks 0.845 eV and 0.787 eV shift towards higher energy (aka j-shift) at similar to 11. 7 meV/decade and similar to 8 meV/decade with increase in laser intensity respectively. The asymmetric and broad spectrum together with large j-shift suggests that the observed peaks at 0.845 eV and 0.787 eV were related to band-to-tail (BT) and band-to-impurity (BI) transition, respectively. Such a band-tail-related transition originates from the potential fluctuation of defect states at low temperature. The appearance of band related transition in CIS film with Cu/In = 0.66 is the indicator of the presence of large number of charged defect states.

Tailored interfaces of unencapsulated perovskite solar cells for > 1,000 hour operational stability	NATURE ENERGY			English	Article							ORGANOMETAL HALIDE PEROVSKITES; INDUCED DEGRADATION; HOLE COLLECTION; EFFICIENCY; DIFFUSION; MIGRATION; IODIDE; PERFORMANCE; MECHANISMS; EXTRACTION	Long-term device stability is the most pressing issue that impedes perovskite solar cell commercialization, given the achieved 22.7% efficiency. The perovskite absorber material itself has been heavily scrutinized for being prone to degradation by water, oxygen and ultraviolet light. To date, most reports characterize device stability in the absence of these extrinsic factors. Here we show that, even under the combined stresses of light (including ultraviolet light), oxygen and moisture, perovskite solar cells can retain 94% of peak efficiency despite 1,000 hours of continuous unencapsulated operation in ambient air conditions (relative humidity of 10-20%). Each interface and contact layer throughout the device stack plays an important role in the overall stability which, when appropriately modified, yields devices in which both the initial rapid decay (often termed burn-in) and the gradual slower decay are suppressed. This extensively modified device architecture and the understanding developed will lead towards durable long-term device performance.

The structural, optical and photoelectronic properties of the MAPbI(3) films varied with the Pb(OAc)(2)/MAI molar ratio. It was found that the Pb(OAc)(2)/MAI molar ratio greatly influenced the structure and morphology of the MAPbI(3) films. A suitable amount of excessive Pb(OAc)(2) (about 5 mol% excessive Pb) in the solution made the film smoother with improved film crystallinity. This resulted in enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, for films derived from solution with low Pb(OAc)(2)/MAI or high Pb(OAc)(2)/MAI ratio, defects such as pits or pinholes were easily formed with low crystallinity, and hence decreased the lifetime of the carriers and photoelectrical properties of the final solar cells. Using a solution with 5% excessive Pb, inverted structured CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells with PCE of nearly 14% were obtained.

Enhanced Grain Size and Crystallinity in CH3NH3PbI3 Perovskite Films by Metal Additives to the Single-Step Solution Fabrication Process	MRS ADVANCES			English	Article							EFFICIENCY	Methods of obtaining large grain size and high crystallinity in absorber materials play an important role in fabrication of high-performance methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)) perovskite solar cells. Here we study the effect of adding small concentrations of Cd2+, Zn2+, and Fe2+ salts to the perovskite precursor solution used in the single-step solution fabrication process. Enhanced grain size and crystallinity in MAPbI(3) films were obtained by using 0.1% of Cd2+ or Zn2+ in the precursor solution. Consequently, solar cells constructed with Cd-and Zn-doped perovskite films show a significant improvement in device performance. These results suggest that the process may be an effective and facile method to fabricate high-efficiency perovskite photovoltaic devices.

Optical design of perovskite solar cells for applications in monolithic tandem configuration with CuInSe2 bottom cells	MRS ADVANCES			English	Article							EFFICIENCY	Monolithic integrated thin film tandem solar cells consisting of a high bandgap perovskite top cell and a low bandgap thin film bottom cell are expected to reach higher power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) with lower manufacturing cost and environmental impacts than the market-dominant crystalline silicon photovoltaics. There have been several demonstrations of 4-terminal and 2-terminal perovskite tandem devices with CuInGaSe2 (CIGS) or CuInSe2 (CIS) and. similar to the other tandem structures. the optimization of this device relies on optimal choice for the perovskite bandgap and thickness. Therefore, further advancement will be enabled by tuning the perovskite absorber to maximize the photocurrent limited by the current match condition. Here, we systematically study the optical absorption and transmission of perovskite thin films with varying absorber bandgap. Based on these results, we model the photocurrent generations in both perovskite and CIS subcells and estimate the performances of projected tandem devices by considering the ideally functioning perovskite and CIS device. Our results show that for perovskite layers with 500 nm thickness the optimal bandgap is around 1.6 eV. With these configurations, PCEs above 20% could be achieved by monolithically integrated perovskite/CIS tandem solar cells. Also by modelling the absorption at every layer we calculate the quantum efficiency at each subcell in addition to tracking optical losses.

Solution-processed Nanocrystal Based Thin Films as Hole Transport Materials in Cadmium Telluride Photovoltaics	MRS ADVANCES			English	Article							IRON PYRITE; BACK CONTACT; CELLS; LAYER	The cadmium telluride (CdTe) photovoltaic (PV) comprise an efficient and cost-effective technology for harvesting solar energy. However. device efficiency remains limited in part by low-open circuit voltage (V-oc ) and fill factor (FF) due to inefficient transport of photo-generated charge carriers. Given the deep valence band of CdTe, the use of copper/gold (Cu/Au) as a back contact serves primarily to narrow the width of the inherent Schottky junction evident in CdTe solar cells (in our laboratory, Cu/Au has been used as a standard back contact). For efficient transport of carriers to and into the back contact, a hole transport layer (HTL) is desired with valence band edge comparable to that of Cdre (similar to -5.9 eV). Here, we report solution-processed nanocrystal (NCs) based thin films as HTLs in CdTe solar cells. The earth abundant materials we discuss include iron pyrite (FeS2), nickel-alloyed iron pyrite (NixFe1-xS2), zinc copper sulfide (ZnxCu1-xS) nanocomposites. and perovskite-based films. The FeS2 and NixFe1-xS2 NCs are synthesized by a hot-injection route, and thin films are fabricated by drop-casting, and spin-coating techniques using colloidal NCs. ZnxCu1-xS thin films are fabricated by chemical bath deposition. These NC-based thin films are applied and studied as the HrLs in CdTe devices. On using these materials, the device performance can be increased up to 10% compared to the standard Cu/Au back contact. Here, we discuss the benefits, challenges, and opportunities for these back contact materials in Cdre photovoltaics.

A compact thin film of electron transport materials (ETMs) plays a key role in these PSCs. However, the traditional ETMs of PSCs, TiO2 nanoparticulate films, suffer from low conductivity and high trap state density. Herein, we exploited TiO2 nanospindles as a compact ETM in planar PSCs for the first time, and achieved an efficient device with a PCE of 19.1%. By optimization with Nb doping into the TiO2 nanospindles, the PCE of the PSC was further improved up to 20.8%. The carrier transfer and collection efficiency were significantly improved after Nb5+ doping, revealed by Mott-Schottky (MS) analysis, space charge limited current (SCLC), photoluminence (PL), time-resolved photoluminence (TRPL) spectra, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and so forth. Moreover, the hysteresis behavior was effectively inhibited and the stability was significantly enhanced. This work may provide a new avenue towards the rational design of efficient ETMs for perovskite solar cells.

However, perovskite active layers in solar cells are frequently prepared with unoptimized processes that lead to layers of inferior quality. This is often the case when research focuses on other aspects of the solar cell device, such as device design and architecture, carrier transport layers, electrodes, interlayers, etc. In this study, a single-step spin-coating method was used to prepare semi-crystalline PbI2(DMSO) complex films via evaporation-induced self-assembly. These optimized intermediate films were then used to form homogeneous methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)) perovskite films of optimum thickness (ca. 400 nm) with uniform surface coverage, good crystallinity, high purity, and grain sizes up to one micron, by employing a sequential deposition process involving intramolecular exchange between the PbI2(DMSO) complex film and a methylammonium iodide (MAI) layer deposited on top of it. We found that for certain ranges of MAI concentration, the formation of optimal-quality perovskite active layers was independent of MAI concentration, so long as MAI deposition occurred at specific corresponding spin speeds. Planar p-i-n perovskite solar cells comprising the optimized active layers were fabricated, and they exhibited negligible hysteresis and a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.72%, without any additional compositional and interfacial engineering. The latter can be used in the future to further enhance the PCE. These findings demonstrate the importance of an optimized perovskite active layer for reproducibly fabricating high-efficiency planar p-i-n photovoltaic devices. Additionally, the simplicity of the PbI2(DMSO) complex film preparation and the versatility of the MAI deposition with this fabrication method further enhances the potential of this material for large-scale processing.

We observed that the tetragonal phase that presents under ambient pressure transformed to a ReO3-type cubic phase at 0.3 GPa, which further converted into a putative orthorhombic structure at 2.7 GPa. The sample was finally separated into crystalline and amorphous fractions beyond 4.7 GPa. During the decompression, the phase-mixed material restored the original structure in two distinct pathways depending on the peak pressures. Being monitored using a laser-excited photoluminescence technique under each applied pressure, it was determined that the bandgap reduced with an increase of the pressure till 0.3 GPa and then enlarged with an increase of the pressure up to 2.7 GPa. This work lays the foundation for understanding pressure-induced phase transitions and bandgap tuning of MAPbI(3), enriching potentially the toolkit for engineering perovskites related photovoltaic devices.

Electron Spin Resonance Investigations on Perovskite Solar Cell Materials Deposited on Glass Substrate	MRS ADVANCES			English	Article								In this article, we report low-temperature electron spin resonance (ESR) investigations carried out on solution processed three-layer inverted solar cell structures: PC61BM/CH3NH3PbI3/PEDOT:PSS/Glass, where PC61BM and PEDOT:PSS act as electron and hole transport layers, respectively. ESR measurements were conducted on ex-situ light (1 Sun) illuminated samples. We find two distinct ESR spectra. First ESR spectra resembles a typical powder pattern, associated with g(x) = g(y) = 4.2; g(z) = 9.2, found to be originated from Fe3+ extrinsic impurity located in the glass substrate. Second ESR spectra contains a broad (peak-to-peak line width similar to 10 G) and intense ESR signal appearing at g = 2.008; and a weak, partly overlapped, but much narrower (peak-to-peak line width similar to 4 G) ESR signal at g = 2.0022. Both sets of ESR spectra degrade in intensity upon light illumination. The latter two signals were found to stem from light-induced silicon dangling bonds and oxygen vacancies, respectively. Our controlled measurements confirm that these centers were generated during UV-ozone treatment of the glass substrate -a necessary step to be performed before PEDOT:PSS is spin coated. This work forms a significant step in understanding the light-induced-as well as extrinsic defects in perovskite solar cell materials.	[Saiz, C. L.; Martinez, L. M.; Singamaneni, S.

TiO2 nanotubes in ST-TNTAs vertically grew on the FTO substrate in single crystallized rutile phase, while SrTiO3 grains in cubic perovskite phase dispersed evenly on the surface of TiO2. The sandwich shaped all-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were assembled with TiO2 nanorods, nanotubes and ST-TNTAs as the photoanode, respectively. Once SrTiO3 deposited, the position of Fermi level of the composited semiconductor raised, resulting in the increase of open circuit voltage (Von). Meanwhile, both short-circuit current density (J(SC)) and photoelectrical conversion efficiency (n) increased first and then decreased with the amount of SrTiO3. In comparison to TiO2 nanorods and nanotubes, ST-TNTAs demonstrated the highest photoelectrical conversion efficiency (5.42%) under the irradiation of solar simulator and external quantum efficiency (EQE) at visible region, and also the lowest electron transfer resistance, which further proved that SrTiO3 acted as a good medium for electron transfer between TiO2 and photosensitizer. As a result, both the increased surface area of the nanotube relative to the nanorod and the matched bandgap structure in the composited structure of TiO2 and SrTiO3 improve the performance of the DSSCs.

So far, the high cost of the most commonly used hole selective material, 2,20,7,7'-Tetrakis (N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9'-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), for high-PCE PVSCs presents a significant obstacle for device cost reduction. In this work, the synthesis and characterization of a new spiro-OMeTAD derivative hole selective material, 2,6,14-tris(5'-(N, N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl) aminophenol-4-yl)-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophen-2-yl)-triptycene (TET) is reported. TET features a three-dimensional structure consisting of a triptycene core and triarylamine arms linked by 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene, facilitating efficient hole transport. Planar PVSCs using TET hole selective layers (HSLs) achieved high fill factors of over 81% and steady-state efficiencies of up to 18.6%, comparable with that (19.0%) of PVSC using spiro-OMeTAD HSL. Importantly, the hereby reported efficient PVSCs can be produced with very thin TET HSLs (about 30 nm). Considering the lower laboratory synthesis and purification cost ($123 vs. $500 g(-1)) and thinner HSL (30 vs. 200 nm), the cost for TET on a unit area of one device is 25 times lower than that for high-purity spiro-OMeTAD. The device with TET HSL shows good stability under continuous illumination. Therefore, this work makes a significant step forward toward the commercialization of the emerging PVSC technology.

The Impact of Graphene on the Fabrication of Thin Film Solar Cells: Current Status and Future Prospects	MATERIALS			English	Review						graphene; thin film solar cell; efficiency; top contacts; back contacts	HOLE-TRANSPORTING MATERIAL; CHEMICAL-VAPOR-DEPOSITION; EFFICIENT; OXIDE; LAYER; NANOGRAPHENE; TRANSPARENCY; ENHANCEMENT; EXTRACTION; ELECTRODE	Commercial solar cells have a power conversion efficiency (PCE) in the range of 10-22% with different light absorbers. Graphene, with demonstrated unique structural, physical, and electrical properties, is expected to bring the positive effects on the development of thin film solar cells. Investigations have been carried out to understand whether graphene can be used as a front and back contacts and active interfacial layer in solar cell fabrication. In this review, the current progress of this research is analyzed, starting from the graphene and graphene-based Schottky diode. Also, the discussion was focused on the progress of graphene-incorporated thin film solar cells that were fabricated with different light absorbers, in particular, the synthesis, fabrication, and characterization of devices. The effect of doping and layer thickness of graphene on PCE was also included. Currently, the PCE of graphene-incorporated bulk-heterojunction devices have enhanced in the range of 0.5-3%. However, device durability and cost-effectiveness are also the challenging factors for commercial production of graphene-incorporated solar cells. In addition to the application of graphene, graphene oxides have been also used in perovskite solar cells. The current needs and likely future investigations for graphene-incorporated solar cells are also discussed.

Perovskite solar cell for photocatalytic water splitting with a TiO2/Co-doped hematite electron transport bilayer	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							AQUEOUS-SOLUTION; PHOTOANODES; ALPHA-FE2O3; PHOTOELECTRODES; GENERATION; EFFICIENCY; COMPOSITE; PROGRESS; TIO2	Hydrogen production using a photoelectrochemical (PEC) route promises to be a clean and efficient way of storing solar energy for use in hydrogen-powered fuel cells. Iron oxide (alpha-Fe2O3) is best suited to be used as a photoelectrode in PEC cells for solar hydrogen production due to its favorable band gap of similar to 2.2 eV. Herein, chemical solution deposition was used for the preparation of a series of Co-doped Fe2O3 thin films on a titania buffer layer at different doping concentrations (3.0, 7.0 and 10.0 at%). The maximum anodic photocurrent reached up to 3.04 mA cm(-2) by optimizing the balance between the doping concentrations, enhanced donor density, light absorbance, and surface roughness. The optical properties show that the light absorbance tendency switches to the higher wavelength with the further increment of Co beyond 3.0%. Finally, synthesized photosensitive perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 materials were added as a surface treatment agent on the photoelectrode to enhance the photocurrent absolute value. This inorganic nanostructured perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI(3)) coated on the Co-doped hematite photoanode achieved an overall solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 2.46%. Due to its low temperature processing, stability, and enhance efficiency, this perovskite coated TiO2/Co-doped hematite multilayer thin film solar cell has high potential to be applied in industry for hydrogen production.

CH3NH3Pb1-xMgxI3 perovskites as environmentally friendly photovoltaic materials	AIP ADVANCES			English	Article							LEAD IODIDE PEROVSKITE; SOLAR-CELLS; RADIATIVE RECOMBINATION; LENGTHS; TIN	In an effort to reduce the toxicity of Pb in perovskite solar cells, the band structures, electron and hole effective masses, and electronic and optical properties of the novel perovskites CH3NH3Pb1-xMgxI3 were predicted using density functional theory with the scalar relativistic generalized gradient approximation. The calculation results indicated that the introduction of the Mg component caused the band gaps of the CH3NH3Pb1-xMgxI3 compounds to exceed that of CH3NH3PbI3. The calculated absorption coefficients of the CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3Pb1-xMgxI3 perovskites revealed that substituting 12.5 mol % of the Pb in CH3NH3PbI3 with Mg had little effect on the absorption ability. Surprisingly, it was also found that CH3NH3Pb0.75Mg0.25I3 retained up to 83% of the absorption performance relative to CH3NH3PbI3. This indicates that the amount of toxic Pb used in perovskite solar cells could be reduced by a quarter while retaining over 80% of the light-absorbing ability. In general, these novel CH3NH3Pb1-xMgxI3 (x <= 0.25) perovskites represent promising candidates for environmentally friendly light-harvesting materials for use in solar cells. (c) 2018 Author(s).

Impact of Ultrathin C-60 on Perovskite Photovoltaic Devices	ACS NANO			English	Article						ultrathin; fullerene; perovskite; photovoltaic; hysteresis	SOLAR-CELLS; ORGANIC PHOTOVOLTAICS; FILL-FACTOR; EFFICIENCY; CH3NH3PBI3; RECOMBINATION; PASSIVATION; HYSTERESIS; DEPOSITION; CONTACT	Halide perovskite solar cells have seen dramatic progress in performance over the past several years. Certified efficiencies of inverted structure (p-i-n) devices have now exceeded 20%. In these p-i-n devices, fullerene compounds are the most popular electron-transfer materials. However, the full function of fullerenes in perovskite solar cells is still under investigation, and the mechanism of photocurrent hysteresis suppression by fullerene remains unclear. In previous reports, thick fullerene layers (>20 nm) were necessary to fully cover the perovskite film surface to make good contact with perovskite film and avoid large leakage currents. In addition, the solution-processed fullerene layer has been broadly thought to infiltrate into the perovskite film to passivate traps on grain boundary surfaces, causing suppressed photocurrent hysteresis. In this work, we demonstrate an efficient perovskite photovoltaic device with only 1 nm C-60 deposited by vapor deposition as the electron-selective material. Utilizing a combination of fluorescence microscopy and impedance spectroscopy, we that the ultrathin C60 predominately acts to extract electrons from the perovskite film while concomitantly suppressing the photocurrent hysteresis by reducing space charge accumulation at the interface. This work ultimately helps to clarify the dominant role of fullerenes in perovskite solar cells while simplifying perovskite solar cell design to reduce manufacturing costs.

Though solvent-solute coordination plays a critical role in HOIP crystallization, the influence of solvent choice on such interactions is poorly understood. We demonstrate Gutmann's donor number, DN, as a parameter that indicates the coordinating ability of the processing solvent with the Pb2+ center of the lead halide precursor. Low DN solvents interact weakly with the Pb2+ center, favoring instead complexation between Pb2+ and iodide and subsequent crystallization of perovskite. High DN solvents coordinate more strongly with the Pb2+ center, which in turn inhibits iodide coordination and stalls perovskite crystallization. Varying the concentration of high-D-N additives in precursor solutions tunes the strength of lead solvent interactions, allowing finer control over the crystallization and the resulting morphology of HOIP active layers.

Aqueous-Containing Precursor Solutions for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells	ADVANCED SCIENCE			English	Article						air processing; aqueous-containing precursors; humidity; perovskites; solar cells	HIGH RELATIVE-HUMIDITY; PLANAR CH3NH3PBI3 PEROVSKITE; HOLE-CONDUCTOR-FREE; CRYSTAL-GROWTH; PERFORMANCE; STABILITY; DEGRADATION; FILMS; WATER; CRYSTALLIZATION	Perovskite semiconductors have emerged as competitive candidates for photovoltaic applications due to their exceptional optoelectronic properties. However, the impact of moisture instability on perovskite films is still a key challenge for perovskite devices. While substantial effort is focused on preventing moisture interaction during the fabrication process, it is demonstrated that low moisture sensitivity, enhanced crystallization, and high performance can actually be achieved by exposure to high water content (up to 25 vol%) during fabrication with an aqueous-containing perovskite precursor. The perovskite solar cells fabricated by this aqueous method show good reproducibility of high efficiency with average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.7% and champion PCE of 20.1% under solar simulation. This study shows that water-perovskite interactions do not necessarily negatively impact the perovskite film preparation process even at the highest efficiencies and that exposure to high contents of water can actually enable humidity tolerance during fabrication in air.

The influence of GBL SVPA on the microstructure of perovskite layers and performance of PSCs was studied. The short circuit current density (J(sc)) of the devices significantly increased, yielding a high efficiency of 16.58%, which was 27.05% higher than that of thermally annealed films. A model was derived to explain the effect of GBL SVPA on PSCs. The perovskite films prepared by this method present several advantages such as complete transformation of PbI2 to CH3NH3PbI3, high crystallinity, large grain size, and fewer grain boundaries than those prepared without GBL SVPA. This improvement is beneficial for charge dissociation and transport in hybrid photovoltaic devices.

Building upon previous work, in which we intentionally contaminated lead halide perovskite (LHP) solar cells with iron, we further examine the distribution and charge state of iron-induced defects in LHP films using synchrotron-based X-ray techniques. X-ray absorption measurements suggest that iron-rich regions, which form among iron feedstock concentrations that exceed 100 ppm, most closely resemble the chemistry of Fe2O3. Iron distributed within the bulk may form a mix of Fe2+ and Fe3+, the latter of which is not expected to be recombination active, potentially allowing LHPs to incorporate more iron than traditional semiconductors. X-ray beam induced current measurements show little correlation between the presence of iron-rich regions and charge collection, which further suggests low recombination activity at these sites. These results further elucidate the recombination behavior caused by iron incorporation in LHP films, revealing insight into how inhomogeneous incorporation of impurities may mitigate photovoltaic performance degradation.

However, their large-scale adoption requires a better understanding on the energy performance of these PVs. In this paper, the life-cycle energy consumptions of two-terminal tandem solar cells consisting of lead-based PK top cells prepared on bottom cells of copper indium gallium selenide, copper zinc tin selenide, and monocrystalline silicon are evaluated. The energy payback time (EPBT) and the energy return on invested (EROI) are the two use-fulmetrics for examining the energy generation performance of PV systems. EPBTs of the current state-of-the-art devices range from 7 months to 12 months, while the EROI of the cells is in the reverse order as the EPBT and ranged between 5.2 and 9.2. These two energy indicators of tandem devices are expected to improve as the tandem PV technologies mature, with an EBPT as low as similar to 27 day (0.9 month) and the EROI as high as 105 for high-efficiency long-lifetime devices.

This has led to a rapid growth in revenue and a corresponding drop in margins that has suppliers implementing solutions to further reduce the costs associated with manufacturing solar panels. Despite these improvements, solar energy derived from photovoltaics still has an energy pay-back time of at least one year with some of this is associated with heating processes. To further reduce costs, a new technology called intense pulsed light is being implemented to eliminate expensive high energy thermal processes and encourage higher throughput. The technology also includes opportunities for devices that contain thermally limited materials. The technique was originally explored when the photovoltaic industry was quite small, and has only recently begun to gather interest as the printed electronics industry realized gains. This review discusses the use of intense pulsed light in photovoltaic manufacturing, detailing the process from a photonic physics perspective, the relevant heat transfer mechanisms, as well as its impact on the major photovoltaic sectors. Demonstrations of generation 1: crystalline silicon solar cells, generation 2: thin film solar cells, and emerging technologies: hybrid organic solar cell applications are discussed. Lastly, future outlooks for intense pulsed light in the photovoltaic manufacturing sector are offered.

Films aged under solar intensities started to degrade above 75 degrees C, while films in the dark degraded at 95 degrees C. To investigate the temperature-induced degradation mechanism, spectroscopic techniques such as Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectroscopy, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS), and Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) were used. Results show that the films aged under light at 75 degrees C degraded to a mixture of PbI2 and metallic Pb. In contrast, films aged thermally in the dark, or with light and oxygen, degraded to PbI2 only. MAPbI(3) solar cells were aged to show the effect of the metallic lead on the charge transfer mechanism.
