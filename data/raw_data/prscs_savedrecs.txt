J	Kim, MR; Choi, HW; Bark, CW				Kim, Ma Ro; Choi, Hyung Wook; Bark, Chung Wung			Low-Temperature Thermally Evaporated SnO2 Based Electron Transporting Layer for Perovskite Solar Cells with Annealing Process	JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Perovskite Solar Cells; Tin Oxide; Thermal-Evaporation	EFFICIENT; INTERFACE; STABILITY; ALIGNMENT; TIO2; ZNO	Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) represent the third generation of solar cells that comprise a semiconductor electrode, a counter electrode, and an electrolyte. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been comprehensively researched and led to an impressive improvement in a short period of time as cheaper alternatives to silicon solar cells due to their high energy-conversion efficiency and low production cost. Tin oxide (SnO2) has attracted attention as a promising candidate for electron transport material of perovskite solar cells, because it can be easily processed by low annealing temperature and solution processing method. However, in the fabrication of SnO2 electron transfer layer (ETL) via the conventional solution method, it is greatly difficult to increase the size of the substrate by the solution treatment method or to commercialize it. In this work, we report the photovoltaic characteristics of SnO2 based electron transport layer for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) fabricated by the thermal-evaporation processing method. The deposited SnO2 layer with the thermal evaporator is known to be not crystallographically stable. To solve this problem, we performed the annealing process at relatively low temperature (below 200 degrees C). As a result, we could confirm the optimum annealing temperature and we could demonstrate PSCs with thermally deposited SnO2 as the compact electron transport layer through a low-temperature annealing process. It would contribute to new opportunities in commercialization and development of perovskite solar cells.

An organic cationic azo dye, methyl red was used as a p-type dopant for poly(3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) to realize highly conductive electrodes for organic light-emitting diode applications. By optimization of the dopant concentration, the doped PEDOT:PSS films exhibited electrical conductivities enhanced by three orders of magnitude compared to the pristine films. Ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy studies indicate that charge transfer complexes between PEDOT:PSS and the dopant were formed. It was found that the dye exhibits high tendency to oxidize the polymer in a single-blend system which is necessary for the efficient doping. Our research proposes a simple and low-cost doping agent to improve the conductivity and sheet resistance of PEDOT:PSS in order to apply it as a promising electrode material for various kinds of highly flexible organic electronic devices.

The effect of MPS2, 4, 6-TMA as interlayers on top of a hole-extraction layer of poly(bis(4-phenyl)-2,4,6-trimethylphenylamine (PTAA) is investigated in inverted perovskite solar cells (PeSCs). Owing to the improved wettability of perovskites on hydrophobic PTAA with the CPEs, the PeSCs with CPE interlayers demonstrate a significantly enhanced device performance, with negligible device-to-device dependence relative to the reference PeSC without CPEs. By increasing the ionic density in the MPS-TMA interlayers, the wetting, interfacial defect passivation, and crystal growth of the perovskites are significantly improved without increasing the series resistance of the PeSCs. In particular, the open-circuit voltage increases from 1.06 V for the PeSC with MPS2-TMA to 1.11 V for the PeSC with MPS6-TMA. The trap densities of the PeSCs with MPS2,4,6-TMA are further analyzed using frequency-dependent capacitance measurements. Finally, a large-area (1 cm(2)) PeSC is successfully fabricated with MPS6-TMA, showing a power conversion efficiency of 18.38% with negligible hysteresis and a stable power output under light soaking for 60 s.

Furthermore, structured HPs with periodic micro- or nanopatterns have recently attracted significant interest due to their potential to not only improve the efficiency of an individual device via the controlled arrangement of HP crystals into a confined geometry, but also to technologically pixelate the device into arrays suitable for future commercialization. However, micro- or nanopatterning of HPs is not usually compatible with conventional photolithography, which is detrimental to ionic HPs and requires special techniques. Herein, a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art technologies used to develop micro- and nanometer-scale HP patterns, with an emphasis on their controlled microstructures based on top-down and bottom-up approaches, and their potential for future applications, is provided. Top-down approaches include modified conventional lithographic techniques and soft-lithographic methods, while bottom-up approaches include template-assisted patterning of HPs based on lithographically defined prepatterns and self-assembly. HP patterning is shown here to not only improve device performance, but also to reveal the unprecedented functionality of HPs, leading to new research areas that utilize their novel photophysical properties.

A variety of organic halide salts are developed to passivate the traps and enhance the charge carrier transport. Here, the use of guanidinium iodide (GuaI) for interfacial modification of mixed-cation (Cs)(x)(FA)(1-)xPbI3 perovskite films, which results in the formation of a low-dimensional delta-FAPbI(3)-like phase on the 3D perovskite surface, is reported. The presence of this thin layer facilitates charge transfer at interfaces and reduces charge carrier recombination pathways as evidenced by enhanced carrier lifetimes and favorable interfacial band alignment. As a result, the power conversion efficiency of the control device is boosted from 19.22% to 20.07%, mainly due to improved open-circuit voltage (V-oc) and fill factor. Furthermore, the post-treatment with GuaI improves the moisture stability of perovskite polycrystalline films and ambient stability of PSCs.

Recently, both their performance and stability have been improved by compositional engineering or defect passivation strategies, due to the modulation of perovskite crystal size and reduction of crystal defects. Herein, a report on the thermally induced phase control (TIPC) strategy is provided, which enables efficient and photostable WBG PSCs without compositional engineering by exploring a thermal annealing process window (100-175 degrees C and 3-60 min) of the WBG perovskite films. Within this window, a key annealing regime is found that produces preferred crystal orientations of lead iodide and the WBG perovskite, suppressing phase segregation and reducing charge recombination in the perovskites. The WBG PSCs (composition of FA(0.75)MA(0.15)Cs(0.1)PbI(2)Br and E-g of 1.73 eV) optimized by TIPC exhibit an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.60% and improved operational stability, maintaining >90% of the maximum PCE (during maximum power point tracking) without encapsulation after 12 h of operation (air mass 1.5 global irradiation in ambient air conditions) or after 500 h of operation (white light-emitting diode irradiation (100 mW cm(-2)) in N-2 conditions).

Currently, a certified efficiency of 25.2% has been achieved for a solar cell using a polycrystalline thin film. This is the result of having reached 75% of the Shockley-Queisser limit for single-junction solar cells. However, for further improvements, new breakthrough technologies are required. This article reviews the impact of previous breakthrough technologies on the efficiency of halide perovskite solar cells, based on certified efficiencies. We clarify the current status of halide perovskite solar cells and introduce photon recycling as the next technological innovation for higher efficiencies. Photon recycling keeps the photon concentration inside the light-harvesting layer high, and consequently, leads to open-circuit voltages close to the theoretical value. Although photon recycling has not yet been implemented in real halide perovskite solar cells, three key technologies for implementing it are examined.

Although poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) has been conventionally employed as a hole extraction layer (HEL) in flexible organic or perovskite solar cells, the inherent stretchability of PEDOT:PSS has yet to be convinced. Here, we report a highly stretchable and mechanically stable PEDOT:PSS-based thin film and its application on flexible perovskite solar cells. We synthesized a chemically linked copolymer, P(SS-co-TFPMA), consisting of PSS and tetrafluoropropyl methacrylate (TFPMA) followed by graft copolymerization with poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA) to form a P(SS-co-TFPMA)-g-PEGMA dopant for the PEDOT HEL. The PEDOT:P(SS-co-TFPMA)-g-PEGMA (PEDOT:PTP) copolymer solution has excellent homogeneity and high phase stability, and its developed HEL film exhibits outstanding stretching capability. After stretching of 300%, PEDOT:PTP films sustain conductivity of over 80% of their original conductivity, whereas the conventional PEDOT:PSS films completely lose their conductivity after a strain of 300%. In addition, the PEDOT:PTP-incorporated flexible perovskite solar cells exhibited improved mechanical stability compared with the unassisted cells, retaining 92% of the initial power conversion efficiency after 1500 bending cycles at a 7 mm radius.

As one of the solutions, it is important to find a transport layer that can improve the stability and durability of the devices. Here, we first employ MoS2 for a hole transport layer (HTL) in high-performance flexible p-i-n-type perovskite photodiode (PD)/solar cell bifunctional devices (PPSBs) with co-doped graphene transparent conductive electrodes. The current of the PPSB increases by up to 10(6) times by illumination even at 0 V, meaning "self-powered". The PPSB exhibits high responsivity and on/off ratio in a broad spectral range of ultraviolet to visible light at a PD mode and good photovoltaic properties at a solar cell mode. The photoresponse shows only 38% degradation during 30 days, and the photo-stability is almost perfect under continuous light soaking for 100 h. Flexible PPSB exhibits excellent mechanical properties by maintaining similar to 57% of its initial photocurrent even after 3000 bending cycles at a curvature radius of 4 mm. These results suggest that MoS2 films can be successfully used as a HTL in perovskites-based rigid/flexible optoelectronic devices.

When those nanoscale MAPbI(x)Br(3-x) perovskites were incorporated as a photosensitizer in typical solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (ss-DSSCs), it could be verified clearly by the capacitance analysis that nano-particulate MAPbI(3) perovskites play the same role as that of a typical dye sensitizer (MK-2 molecule) although their size, composition, and structure are different.

By controlling the deposition rate of the WO3-x and Ag layers, we can control the interface structure between WO3-x and Ag and improve both the optical and electrical properties of the thermally evaporated WAW multilayer electrodes. At the optimized deposition rate of WO3-x (2.5 angstrom /sec) and Ag (10 angstrom /sec), the symmetric WAW multilayer exhibited a high optical transmittance of 92.16% at a 550nm wavelength and low sheet resistance of 3.78 Omega /square. During repeated bending, rolling, and twisting, there was no resistance change indicating the superior flexibility of WAW multilayer electrodes. As a promising application of the WAW multilayer electrodes, we suggested the transparent and flexible thin film heaters (TFHs) to substitute the high cost indium tin oxide-based TFHs. In comparison to the ITO-based TFHs, the WAW based TFHs showed higher convective heat transfer property and higher saturation temperatures are achieved at lower input voltages due to lower sheet resistance. This indicates that the WAW multilayer is suitable as the electrode for high performance transparent and flexible TFHs.

Here to overcome this challenge we apply the band gap tuning and surface passivation strategy for reducing the recombination losses at the interface between the TiO2 layer and perovskite absorber. The TiO2 surface was modified by SO42- anions and Cd2+ cations using a low-cost chemical solution technique. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis revealed that the chemical modification of the TiO2 surface leads to the downward shift of the valence band maximum pointing out the increased conduction electron density and resulting in minimizing the barrier losses at the interface. Electrochemical impedance measurements proved that the modification of the TiO2 surface significantly decreases the charge transfer resistance at the interface with perovskite light absorber. As a result, open circuit voltage and fill factor parameters of the PSCs were enhanced and the hysteresis is decreased. Moreover, the surface passivation significantly improves the air stability of PSCs indicating that the stability of the whole device critically depends on the TiO2/perovskite interface structure. Thus, our study provides valuable guideline toward the designing of hetero-interfaces to enhance both the power conversion efficiency and stability of PSCs.

The morphology and crystal structure of the films have a profound effect on the characteristics and performance of devices; however, the influence of underlying hole transport layers (HTLs) or electron transport layers (ETLs) and film thickness on the film morphology and electronic characteristics remains unclear. Herein, the characteristics of perovskite films with variable thickness are studied, including the morphological, crystal, optical properties and electronic band structure of these films using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and UV-vis absorption spectra. The corresponding performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) devices is correlated with the different thicknesses of perovskite films. In addition, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) results show that for the optimized perovskite thickness (310 nm) the interfacial dipole (Delta) formed at the interface with the substrate reaches its highest value of 0.23 eV. Therefore, this strong dipole compared with other thicknesses allows the carriers to be swept out efficiently.

In this work, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA), having both effective C-O and O-H functional groups, is introduced as a functional additive that suppress imperfections by to control the crystallization process and passivate them at the same time, and the role of each function groups have been systematically investigated. We have found that O-H functional groups of HEA strongly interacts with organic cations (i.e., MABr, FAI) to form more stable organic cation-HEA complex selectively, delaying the crystallization process of perovskite. As a result, HEA improves crystallinity and grain size of perovskite and reduces charge trapping density by passivation and/or suppression of defect states. HEA raises average cell-efficiency from 17.37% to 19.01% and the maximum efficiency is reached to 21.01% for the inverted planar PSC. In addition, large-area (1.08 cm(2)) PSCs show an excellent efficiency of 20.40%, which is the highest efficiency in large-area inverted planar PSCs to date. PSCs with HEA also show long-term stability and better moisture resistance capabilities in ambient air conditions.

These PSCs consist of four main interfaces between the conductive oxide such as fluorine-doped tin oxide and indium tin oxide, compact titanium dioxide electrode (cp-TiO2) layer, mesoporous titanium dioxide electrode (mp-TiO2) layer, perovskite layer, hole transporting layer, and metallic electrode. Among these interfaces, the electron transporting layer and perovskite layers such as cp-TiO2 and mp-TiO2 play a significant role in blocking holes and transporting electrons, which is important for realizing high power conversion efficiency (PCE). Various approaches have been employed to modify TiO2 to improve PCE. In this study, the effect of chemical surface activation on the TiO2 electrode via lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide treatment were investigated, and the performances of the PSCs were evaluated. The experimental results help understand the effect of surface activation on the PSCs.

We developed a stable perovskite solar cell with a bandgap of similar to 1.7 electron volts that retained more than 80% of its initial PCE of 20.7% after 1000 hours of continuous illumination. Anion engineering of phenethylammonium-based two-dimensional (2D) additives was critical for controlling the structural and electrical properties of the 2D passivation layers based on a lead iodide framework. The high PCE of 26.7% of a monolithic two-terminal wide-bandgap perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell was made possible by the ideal combination of spectral responses of the top and bottom cells.

As a result, PCE over 23% was recorded in 2018 and stability over 10 000 h was reported. Beyond photovoltaics, lead halide perovskite materials demonstrated superb properties when they were applied to flat-panel x-ray detectors and non-volatile resistive switching memory. In this review, the progress of the lead halide perovskite in photovoltaics, x-ray imaging and memristors is investigated. Pb-based PSCs and non-Pb-based PSCs are compared, where technologies of non-Pb-based PSCs are not matured for commercialization. Pb-based PSCs were found to be highly suitable for both terrestrial and space photovoltaics. Higher sensitivity under low dose rate observed from the lead halide perovskite suggests a bright future for perovskite x-ray imaging systems. Moreover, high on/off ratio and low energy consumption observed in resistive switching enables perovskite to be a promising candidate for high density memristors.

Here, a surface treatment approach is addressed for tungsten oxide-based transparent electrodes through slight modification of the tungsten oxide surface with niobium oxide. Incorporation of this transparent electrode technique to the protective buffer layer significantly recovers the fill factor from 70.4% to 80.3%, approaching fill factor values of conventional opaque devices, which results in power conversion efficiencies over 18% for the semitransparent perovskite solar cells. Application of this approach to a four-terminal tandem configuration with a silicon bottom cell is demonstrated.

Transition metal oxides in N-I-P structures have been widely used as electron-transporting materials but the need for a high-temperature sintering step is incompatible with flexible substrate materials and perovskite materials which cannot withstand elevated temperatures. In this work, novel metal oxides prepared by sputtering deposition were investigated as electron-transport layers in planar PSCs with the N-I-P structure. The incorporation of tungsten in the oxide layer led to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) increase from 8.23% to 16.05% due to the enhanced electron transfer and reduced back-recombination. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images reveal that relatively large grain sizes in the perovskite phase with small grain boundaries were formed when the perovskite was deposited on tungsten-doped films. This study demonstrates that novel metal oxides can be used as in perovskite devices as electron transfer layers to improve the efficiency.

Solution was aged at ambient conditions for 4 weeks, where two different precursor solutions were prepared by dissolving FM and PbI2 in DMSO/DMF solvent (precursor mixture solution) and the synthesized single crystalline alpha-FAPbI(3) in the same solvent (single crystal solution). Perovskite films were prepared by depositing fresh or aged solutions at weekly intervals. Photovoltaic parameters were hardly altered by aging the single crystal solution, while power conversion efficiency was gradually decreased with aging time for the precursor mixture solution mainly due to the decreased photocurrent density and fill factor. Solution pH was changed from basic to acidic due to HI formed by aging the precursor mixture solution, which prevents the formation of alpha-phase of FAPbI(3). For the single crystal solution, basic conditions remained unchanged by aging. In addition, the presence of delta-phase in the annealed perovskite films was found to have negative influence on the long-term stability. It is thus important to maintain the pH of the precursor solution to avoid aging effects and remove delta-phase in the annealed film for device stability.

J	Shin, SG; Kim, IT; Choi, HW				Shin, Seong Gwan; Kim, Ii Tae; Choi, Hyung Wook			A study of perovskite solar cell with a Fe3+/Ga3+ doped TiO2 layer	JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Solid State Devices and Materials (SSDM)	SEP 02-05, 2019	Nagoya Univ, Nagoya, JAPAN	Japan Soc Appl Phys	Nagoya Univ		TITANIUM-DIOXIDE; BLOCKING LAYERS; TEMPERATURE; DEPOSITION; EFFICIENCY; DIFFUSION; TRANSPORT; LENGTHS	Perovskite has a structure of a large number of solar cells, which is very promising for the rapid commercialization of large-scale, low-cost solar cells. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have many advantages, such as their simple processing techniques and inexpensive raw materials. The conduction band of TiO2 used in many PSCs coincides well with that of the perovskite active layer. In addition, TiO2 has excellent stability and conductivity and can be obtained by various low-cost deposition methods. However, TiO2 traps electrons in oxygen vacancies and Ti lattice sites; Fe3+ this leads to recombination, which in turn reduces the efficiency of the device. In this study, we investigated the effects of Fe3+ and Ga3+ ions on the efficiency of PSCs by doping them in a compact and mesoporous layer of TiO2. As a result, the perovskite solar cell using TiO2 doped with Fe3+ and Ga3+ shows an open-circuit voltage of 0.974 V, current density of 21.909 mA cm(-2), 66.646% fill factor, and 14.21% efficiency. Fe3+ and Ga3+ have a smaller atomic radius than Ti4+ and thus, can replace Ti cations. Furthermore, the Fe3+ and Ga3+ doping of TiO2 is considered to be superior for the photoelectric performance of PSCs.

Compared with conventional TiO2 nanoparticles, the spherical assemblies consisting of low-dimensional nanocrystallites present significant advantages in terms of structural isotropy, monodisperse nature, structural diversity on nano- and (sub)micro-scales, structural stability, light harvesting property, interconnected nanobuilding blocks with less grain boundary, and easy reclaim. Superior performances have been demonstrated in the fields of photoelectrocatalysis and photovoltaics. Research efforts have been devoted to the rational design of a synthetic strategy for the facile preparation of nanoporous TiO2 spheres. The last decade has witnessed rapid progress in developing a synthesis strategy of nanoporous TiO2 spheres for optimal photochemical applications. Both chemical and physical routes have been extensively developed aiming to ease control over the self-assembly of nanobuilding blocks and, thus, the resultant textural properties and physicochemical performances of the nanoporous TiO2 spheres. In this review, a comprehensive description of different synthetic strategies is first presented, with a special emphasis on the formation mechanism, in particular, the pathway followed by nanocrystallites to self-assemble into a spherical structure. Notable experimental parameters are also discussed for the reproducible and controllable preparation of nanoporous TiO2 spheres with well-defined hierarchical structure, tunable porous microstructure from assembled nanobuilding blocks, and optimal physicochemical properties. Important applications in environmental photocatalysis, solar fuel synthesis, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), and perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are summarized, and the synthesis-component-structure-property relationship in nanoporous TiO2 spheres is highlighted. Finally, perspectives in this rapidly developing field are offered.

Here, the universal benefits and common factors that influence both PeSCs and OSCs as a result of changes in Al-doped TiO2 properties are investigated. These common factors are identified in two separate mechanisms. The first involves surface smoothing of TiO2 films, which affects the formation of a high crystalline active layer and reduces recombination between the electron extraction and active layers. The second involves bandgap widening of TiO2, which reduces the activation energy and enhances the quenching efficiency of devices. These factors are demonstrated in various measurements. The results will help in understanding the fundamental benefits of Al-doped TiO2 in solution-processed thin-film solar cells.

Here a perovskite layer on textured silicon is formed through a dry two-step conversion process with lead oxide sputtering and direct contact with methyl ammonium iodide. The silicon surface texture significantly affects the current density and efficiency of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. However, only a few studies have explored fabricating perovskite on textured silicon and the effect of texture on perovskite films because of the limitations of solution processes. Here we produce conformal perovskite on textured silicon with a dry two-step conversion process that incorporates lead oxide sputtering and direct contact with methyl ammonium iodide. To separately analyze the influence of each texture structure on perovskite films, patterned texture, high-resolution photoluminescence (mu-PL), and light beam-induced current (mu-LBIC), 3D mapping is used.

Herein, planar p-i-n type perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with enhanced efficiency and long-term stability were developed by incorporating CQDs into a nickel oxide (NiO) hole transport layer (HTL). The incorporation of CQDs downshifts the band structure of NiO, leading to good alignment with the work-function of the tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) electrode and the band-edges of the perovskite. The efficient cascade charge transport achieved with the optimized incorporation ratio of CQDs resulted in an enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.02%, compared to that of the PSC fabricated with bare NiO (15.66%), even though they were fabricated in air. The suppressed charge recombination accompanied by restricted charge accumulation curtails the J-V hysteresis, with a reduction from 4.5% to less than 1%. Moreover, long-term stability under atmospheric conditions without any encapsulation was achieved with CQD-incorporated NiO. More than 70% of the initial PCE was retained over 190 h. This work suggests a novel strategy for fabricating solution-processible metal oxide interlayers with highly efficient charge migration for divergence energy conversion devices.

The anodized WO3 material was composed of two distinct layers; the T-WO3 NRs which functions as an active layer for the PEC reaction and another compact WO3 (C-WO3) barrier which acts as a blocking layer for the charge transport. From more resistance of thicker C-WO3 layer, to minimize the formation of the C-WO3 layer under constant applied voltage, we performed rapid-thermal annealing under air ambient as a postthermal treatment. As the post-annealing time increased, the thickness of T-WO3 NRs layer remained at approximately 680 nm, but the C-WO3 thickness gradually increased from about 91 nm at 1 min to 633 nm at 120 min. Unexpectedly, the anodic WO3 film having a compact layer thickness of about 475 nm exhibited the highest PEC performance, corresponding to a photocurrent density of 0.75 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode, subsequently followed by anodic WO3 films with less thick compact layers. This suggests that the C-WO3 layer promotes the charge separation/transfer events by formation of cascading band alignments between the T-WO3 NR and C-WO3 layers.

We provide a direct correlation between V-oc and the interfacial characteristics of perovskites tuned through stoichiometry engineering of precursor solutions and surface modification of the underlying poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) layer. Poor quality interfacial perovskite crystals were observed on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer, resulting in strong interfacial recombination and a low V-oc. In contrast, the growth of the interfacial perovskite crystals was significantly improved by the synergic effects of varying the precursor solution composition and covering the surface with a pH-neutral conjugated polyelectrolyte, poly[2,6-(4,4-bis (potassium butanylsulfonate)-4H-cyclopenta [2,1-b; 3,4-b']dithiophene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole) (CPE-K), which possesses potassium ions as counter ions. The influence of the energy-level alignment at the interface on V-oc was also discussed. Our findings highlight that improved perovskite crystallization at the interface can facilitate bulk growth of perovskite grains in the vertical direction and effectively suppress nonradiative surface charge recombination, thus enhancing the short-circuit current and V-oc.

The effective confinement of high-density plasma between InZnO and InSnO targets by directional magnet fields and negative bias applied simultaneously on both targets led to the successful sputtering of the amorphous IZTO top cathode on the semi-transparent PSCs without plasma damage or degradation of PSC performance. At an optimal sputtering condition of the IZTO top cathode, the semi-transparent PSC showed an open circuit voltage (1.056 V), short circuit current (16.79 mA/cm(2)), fill factor (51.19%), and power conversion efficiency (9.081%) comparable to those of reference PSC with an Ag metal top cathode. Based on synchrotron GIWAXS and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy examinations, we suggested a possible mechanism with which to explain the plasma damage effect on the performance of PCSs while sputtering IZTO top cathode on semi-transparent PSCs.

One-step P2 scribing of organometal halide perovskite solar cells by picosecond laser of visible wavelength	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Perovskite thin film solar cell; Laser scribing; Picosecond laser; P2 scribing	HOLE-TRANSPORTING MATERIAL; MODULES; LENGTHS; LIGHT; PHOTOVOLTAICS; PERFORMANCE; EFFICIENCY; LAYER	Perovskite solar cells (PSC) have attracted attention by their unprecedented rise in device efficiency. However, the PSCs were mostly tested for the unit cells of small area, and it is important to upscale to solar modules. Laser scribing has great potential to this end. However, the key challenge identified in one-step P2 laser scribing is to remove film stack including the hole block layer (HBL) without damaging transparent conducing oxide (TCO) based bottom contact and thus to provide interconnecting paths with minimized contact resistance. In this study, we evaluate one-step P2 scribing performance of picosecond laser of 532 nm wavelength for mesoscopic perovskite architecture with the c-TiO2 (compact TiO2) as the HBL and fluorine doped fin oxide (FTO) as bottom contact. Despite anticipated challenge of low absorption selectivity, c-TiO2 layer could be efficiently removed without FTO damage over wide processing window enabling a self-terminating mechanism. Detailed parametric studies elucidate relevant scribing mechanisms such as layer-by-layer ablation mechanism or lift-off mechanism depending laser illumination direction. It is also revealed that the removal of c-TiO2 is triggered by ablation of upper layers, in particular, the mesoporous TiO2. Module level test is under way in conjunction with investigation of further scribing mechanisms.

In this work, we study the role of a new ultrathin interface layer of titanium nitride (TiN) conformally deposited on a mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) scaffold using the atomic layer deposition method. Our characterization results revealed that the presence of TiN at the ETL/perovskite interface improves the charge collection as well as reduces the interface recombination. We find that the morphology (grain size) and optical properties of the perovskite film deposited on the optimized mp-TiO2/TiN ETL are improved drastically, leading to devices with a maximum PCE of 19.38% and a high open-circuit voltage (V-oc) of 1.148 V with negligible hysteresis and improved environmental (similar to 40% RH) and thermal (80 degrees C) stabilities.

J	Nguyen, TMH; Bark, CW				Thi My Huyen Nguyen; Bark, Chung Wung			Synthesis of Cobalt-Doped TiO2 Based on Metal-Organic Frameworks as an Effective Electron Transport Material in Perovskite Solar Cells	ACS OMEGA			English	Article							EFFICIENCY	In this study, Co-doped TiO2 was prepared successfully using a solvothermal method with trimesic acid (H3BTC) as an organic framework to form the Co-doped Ti metal-organic framework (Co-doped Ti-MOF). By thermally decomposing the Co-doped Ti-MOF in air, the framework template was removed, and porous Co-doped TiO2 was obtained. The crystal structure of the material was analyzed using X-ray diffraction. The morphology was examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and focused ion beam SEM. The large specific surface area was determined to be 135.95 m(2) g(-1) using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller theory. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy verified the presence of Ti-O-Ti and Co-O vibrations in the as-prepared sample. Furthermore, the results of UV-vis spectroscopy showed that doping with Co remarkably improved the absorption ability of Ti-MOF toward the visible-light region with a band gap energy of 2.38 eV (lambda = 502 nm). Steady-state photoluminescence and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were conducted to illustrate the improvement of electron transfer in the doped material further. The optimum power conversion efficiency of solar cells using 1 wt % Co-doped TiO2 as an electron transport layer was found to be 15.75%, while that of solar cells using commercial dyesol TiO2 is only 14.42%.

By using the density functional theory (DFT) method, the electronic structures of H or F edge functionalized armchair type GNRs on MAPbI(3)(001) are calculated. It is shown that the electronic structure of H- or F-passivated GNRs is almost undisrupted by the non-covalent interaction with the PbI2 surface layer of MAPbI(3)(001), thereby one can tune the width and edge chemistry of GNRs to enhance the carrier extraction or blocking. Especially all H-GNRs five to ten carbon atoms wide exhibit good matching for hole extraction, while F-GNRs require a specific width for electron extraction. Exploiting the unzipping synthesis of carbon nanotubes in the solution phase, our result provides a facile strategy for efficient carrier extraction.

A record solar cell efficiency of 9.50 % under 0.1 sun with an electrode spacing of 1.5 mu m is attained in lateral single-crystal perovskite materials. Moreover, successful integration for high-source-power-generation interdigitated electrode units patterned in series (1x4), parallel (4x1), and combination (4 seriesx4 parallel) configurations is devised and affords maximum efficiencies of 7.99, 8.19, and 7.96 %, respectively. Additionally, the cell performances under various illumination intensities (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 sun) to mimic daily sunshine angles and an indoor environment at 1000 lux are elucidated for which short-circuit current (J(SC)) values (19.60 mA cm(-2) and eta=7.43 %) under 1.0 sun and a significant efficiency of 8.13 % under indoor conditions are obtained. This work represents a significant step towards next-generation, efficient, lateral photovoltaics for possible module integration.

Here, we deposit a thin layer of ZnS as a buffer layer at the interface of the perovskite absorber and electron transporting layer (ETL) using the atomic layer deposition (ALD) process. The impact of the ZnS layer on the photovoltaic characteristics of PSCs was investigated by comparison of two mesoscopic configurations, in which the ZnS layer is grown on compact TiO2 and on mesoporous TiO2 surfaces. Our results revealed that the addition of an ultrathin ZnS layer between the perovskite and ETL drastically improves the charge extraction properties and reduces interface recombination. Moreover, we demonstrate that the deposition of an optimum ZnS layer (with a thickness of 1.8 nm) on top of the mesoporous TiO2 surface has the best effect on the improvement of the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, yielding a champion efficiency of 19.10% with negligible hysteresis. These results indicate that interface engineering with the ZnS film deposited by ALD is an effective approach toward highly efficient and reproducible PSCs.

J	Kim, S; Bark, CW				Kim, Sangmo; Bark, Chung Wung			Effect of Surface Treatment by Chemical-Mechanical Polishing for Transparent Electrode of Perovskite Solar Cells	ENERGIES			English	Article						perovskite; solar cell; CMP; surface; FTO	OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; TIO2 LAYER; THIN-FILM; PERFORMANCE	Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are usually fabricated by using the spin coating method. During the fabrication process, the surface status is very important for energy conversion between layers coated in the substrate. PSCs have multilayer-stacked structures, such as the transparent electrode layer, the perovskite layer, and a metal electrode. The efficiency and uniformity of all layers depend on the surface status of the transparent electrode coated on the glass substrate. Until now, etching methods by chemical processes have been introduced to make the substrate surface smooth and uniform by decreasing surface roughness. However, highly reactive chemical treatments can be harmful to the environment. In this study, we employed an eco-friendly chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) process to ensure the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate is treated with a smooth surface. Before the perovskite layer and electron transport layer (ETL) are applied, the TiO2 layer is coated with the FTO substrate, and the surface of the FTO substrate is polished using CMP. As a result, the CMP-treated surface of the FTO substrate showed a smooth surface, and the PSCs with CMP treatment did not require conventional TiCl4 treatment.

Here, we report on reproducibly efficient (>21%) PSCs based on the ambient-temperature-stable delta-phase FAPbI(3) powder, synthesized by reacting PbI2 (either homemade or low-grade commercial product with purity <99%) with formamidinium iodide (FAI) at room temperature (similar to 93% yield). X-ray diffraction patterns confirm that annealing the spin-coated film leads to phase purity of cubic alpha FAPbI(3). As compared to the conventional precursor mixture based on PbI2 (purity = 99.9985%), significantly reducing defects in the powder-based film is responsible for the stable and reproducible efficiency. In addition, the homogeneous light-intensity-dependent surface photo current contributes to the reproducibility of photovoltaic performance. The quasi-steady-state power conversion efficiency of 21.07% is certified for the device based on FAPbI(3) powder.

J	Lee, J; Singh, S; Kim, S; Baik, S				Lee, Jiyong; Singh, Swati; Kim, Seongkyun; Baik, Seunghyun			Graphene interfacial diffusion barrier between CuSCN and Au layers for stable perovskite solar cells	CARBON			English	Article							DEGRADATION; CH3NH3PBI3; EFFICIENT; FILMS; STABILITY; MIGRATION	Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly achieved a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, the inherent instability of components has impeded industrialization. Here we employed atomically-thin impermeable graphene (3 layers) as an interfacial barrier for moisture, I- ion, and Au diffusion. A new graphene transfer method was developed, and the position was carefully optimized between the CuSCN and Au electrode in a full cell considering the band alignment of cell components. There was a negligible change in maximum PCE (15.2-15.8%) with the incorporation of graphene due to the high hole mobility of graphene. The moisture intrusion was significantly reduced under 85% relative humidity (RH) for 3 weeks, suppressing PbI2 formation. The graphene barrier maintained >94% of initial PCE under 50% RH for 30 days. It mostly inhibited I- ion migration and perfectly blocked Au diffusion between the perovskite and Au electrode, allowing reversible recovery of electrical power during 3 continuous illumination/dark cycles (12 h each) with a positive bias.

The removal of liquid electrolyte has lead to improved efficiency and stability. Supported by high-quality perovskite films, the certified efficiency of Per-SCs has reached 25.2%. For Per-SCs assembled in a conventional structure (n-i-p), the hole transport layer (HTL) plays an extra role in preventing the perovskite layer from external stimuli. In summary, the successful design and fabrication of the HTL must meet various requirements in terms of solubility, hole transport, recombination prevention, stability, and reproducibility, to name but a few. Many research strategies are focused on the development of high-performance HTMs to meet such requirements. Such strategies for the development of HTMs employed in conventional n-i-p solar cells are reviewed herein. A vision of the future HTMs is proposed in this review based on the already proposed solutions and current trends.

Solar cells prepared via the Pe-PCBM BHS method exhibited a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18% than 11% from a device with a conventional planar heterojunction structure. The Pe-PCBM BHS can enhance device efficiency by improving electron transfer, shortening the electron transport length required for collection, and reducing the charge transfer resistance at the interface between the perovskite and PCBM through an increase of the perovskite crystal size and construction of a vertical perovskite-PCBM intermixing zone. To the best of our knowledge, the high PCE achieved by our Pe-PCBM BHS is the highest value to be reported in an inverted perovskite solar cell without buffer layers, such as metal oxides or low work function metals.

To achieve highly efficient SnO2-based PeSCs, it is necessary to control the oxygen vacancies in the SnO2 layer, since the electrical and optical properties vary depending on the oxidation state of Sn. This study demonstrates that the performance of PeSCs may be improved by using nitrogen-doped graphene oxide (NGO) as an oxidizing agent for SnO2. Since NGO changes the oxidation state of the Sn in SnO2 from Sn2+ to Sn4+, the oxygen vacancies in SnO2 can be reduced using NGO. Multiple devices are fabricated, and various techniques are used to assess their performance, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, dark current analysis, and the dependence of the open-circuit voltage on light intensity. Compared with the average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of control devices, PeSCs with SnO2:NGO composite layers exhibit greater PCEs with less deviation. Therefore, the introduction of NGO in a SnO2 layer can be regarded as an effective method of controlling the oxidation state of SnO2 to improve the performance of PeSCs.

The CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystal absorbs solar irradiation at wavelengths shorter than 520 nm and emits photons at a wavelength of 532 nm. These down-shifted photons pass the TCO layer without parasitic absorption and are absorbed in the CIGS absorber layer where they generate photocurrent. By minimizing the parasitic absorption in the TCO layer, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the CIGS solar cell with the CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystal layer is highly improved in the UV wavelength range between 300 and 390 nm. Additionally, in the wavelength range between 500 and 1100 nm, the EQE is improved since the surface reflectance of the CIGS device with the CsPbBr3 perovskite LDS layer was reduced. This is because the CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystal layer, which has an effective refractive index of 1.82 at a wavelength of 800 nm, reduces the large refractive index mismatch between air (n(air) = 1.00) and the TCO layer (n(ZnO) = 1.96 at a wavelength of 800 nm). Both the short circuit current density and power conversion efficiency of the flexible CIGS solar cell integrated with the CsPbBr3 perovskite are improved by 4.5% compared with the conventional CIGS solar cell without the CsPbBr3 perovskite LDS layer.

One challenge is improving the efficacy of the spatial confinement of excitons for higher luminescence efficiency. Here, we present a simple yet very effective strategy to form fine-grain-structured CsPbBr3 polycrystalline films prepared by thermal co-evaporation. The strategy involves controlling growth kinetics by adjusting the deposition rate, which, along with growth temperature, determines the nucleation rate and therefore the eventual grain structure. A correlation between deposition rate and average grain size was noted except for a very large deposition rate when there were large hillocks, which we attributed to the peculiar growth behavior of PbBr2 films. The growth conditions that produced a nanoscale grain structure and textured orientations without large hillocks also resulted in the highest luminescence efficiency as we anticipated. With the optimized CsPbBr3 light emitters, we demonstrate a green-light-emitting (at 524 nm) LED with a maximum current efficiency of 1.07 cd/A and an extremely narrow electroluminescence spectrum of 18 nm, a result that highlights the potential of vacuum-processed CsPbBr3 films for high-efficiency LEDs.

The low temperature and solution processed PEDOT:PSS/SrGO interlayer produced better power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.01% than other single layers. Comprehensive investigations reveal that the increased PCE is mostly due to the decreased recombination and the increased built in potential for better charge transport and extraction. In addition, the device with PEDOT:PSS/SrGO showed excellent long-term stability in ambient air conditions.

For efficient perovskite solar cells, a uniform and dense perovskite film should be fabricated. A popular method to obtain such film is anti-solvent dripping during the intermediate phase formation. This dripping should be performed at the certain delay time after the spin start. The change in delay time could impact defect formation, significantly varying the electronic structure. The electronic structure of a perovskite film plays a crucial role in the charge transport and recombination in the devices. Thus, the determination of the electronic structure is of major significance to analyze the device performance. In this study, we investigated the electronic structure of methylammonium lead triiodide films fabricated with the different delay time of diethyl ether (DE) dripping. The core level and the valence band were measured using X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. As the DE dripping delay time increases, the I/N ratio increases while the work function decreases. This would be attributed to the n-doping effect by the positively charged I-interstitial defect formation.

Here, we report the ultraviolet (UV) light-induced degradation mechanism at the interfaces between perovskite halide and conventional TiO2 ETL materials and provide a solution to overcome this drawback. UV-induced degradation is shown to be attributed to the formation of oxygen vacancies formed at the perovskite halide-ETL interface under UV light illumination, where the oxygen atoms released at the interface accelerate the decomposition of perovskite halide by inducing chemical reactions. Meanwhile, nanocrystalline SrTiO3 (STO) ETLs are revealed to be tunable in enabling high performance in PSCs under UV light illumination. Indeed, tuning the electronic structure of STO ETLs by Nb doping, in combination with the controllable removal of SrO phases segregated on the Nb-doped STO ETL surfaces, is exhibited to enable robust interface stability and stable high photovoltaic energy conversion efficiency for PSCs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that STO-based PSCs have no hysteresis due to low defect concentrations at the perovskite halide-STO ETL interfaces.

As OIH-PSC materials have hygroscopic organic cations that limit their thermal and long-term stability (i.e. operational lifetime of about 1 year, much shorter than commercial Si of 20-25 years), significant research efforts have been directed to the development of all-inorganic PSCs to overcome this limitation. These studies have demonstrated that cesium lead halide (CsPbX3) and Pb-free cesium tin halide (CsSnX3) perovskites are promising materials for the fabrication of thermally stable and efficient solar cells. This work reviews recent progress on versatile CsPbX3 and CsSnX3 inorganic PSCs. Remarkable PCE values over 17% and 4% have been achieved by employing CsPbX3 and CsSnX3 perovskites, respectively, in a short development time. In addition, we evaluate the materials engineering methods and film deposition techniques for producing such inorganic perovskite materials. Several strategies including surface and interfacial passivation are discussed to alleviate hysteresis and instability of inorganic PSCs. Furthermore, future research directions including device engineering using inorganic metal oxide charge transport layers are suggested to further reinforce this innovative advances in the inorganic PSCs.

However, their production is energy-demanding and relatively expensive. Therefore, photovoltaic cells based on organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites have attracted considerable attention owing to their high conversion efficiencies, simple preparation, and potentially low production costs. In this study, we investigated the effect of Fe3+ doped into a compact and mesoporous layer of TiO2 on the efficiency of the resultant perovskite solar cell (PSC). The efficiencies achieved for PSCs with Fe3+/TiO2 were higher than those for cells with pure TiO2 nanoparticles. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, and current-voltage measurements. The photoelectrode PSC exhibited a high light-to-electric-energy conversion efficiency under a simulated solar light irradiation of 100 mW/cm(2) (AM 1.5). Our results suggest that Fe3+ nanoparticles in the TiO2 layer may contribute to the performance improvement of the PSC.

The p-type ta-C film has several remarkable features, including ease of fabrication without the need for thermal annealing, reasonable electrical conductivity, optical transmittance, and a high work function. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy examinations show that the electrical properties (sp(3)/sp(2) hybridized bond) and work function of the ta-C HTL are appropriate for PSCs and QDLEDs. In addition, in order to correlate the performance of the devices, the optical, surface morphological, and structural properties of the FCVA-grown ta-C films with different thicknesses (5 similar to 20 nm) deposited on the ITO anode are investigated in detail. The optimized ta-C film with a thickness of 5 nm deposited on the ITO anode had a sheet resistance of 10.33 omega(-2), a resistivity of 1.34 x 10(-4) omega cm, and an optical transmittance of 88.97%. Compared to the reference PSC with p-NiO HTL, the PSC with 5 nm thick ta-C HTL yielded a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE, 10.53%) due to its improved fill factor. Further, the performance of QDLEDs with 5 nm thick ta-C hole injection layers (HIL) showed better than the performance of QDLEDs with different ta-C thicknesses. It is concluded that ta-C films have the potential to serve as HTL and HIL in next-generation PSCs and QDLEDs. [GRAPHICS] .

The thickness of graded GZO layer was controlled to optimize GZO-indium tin oxide (ITO) combined electrode for planar n-i-p PSCs. At optimized graded thickness of 15 nm, the GZO-ITO combined electrode showed an optical transmittance of 95%, a resistivity of 2.3 x 10(-4) Ohm cm, a sheet resistance of 15.6 Ohm/square, and work function of 4.23 eV, which is well matched with the 4.0-eV lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of [6,6]-phenyl-C-61-butyric acid methyl ester. Owing to enhanced extraction of electron by the graded GZO, the n-i-p PSC with GZO-ITO combined electrode showed higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.67% than the PCE (5.25%) of PSC with only ITO electrode without GZO-graded layer. In addition, the GZO integrated-ITO electrode acts as transparent electrode and electron extraction layer simultaneously due to graded mixing of the GZO at the surface region of ITO electrode.

J	Yi, A; Chae, S; Lee, H; Kim, HJ				Yi, Ahra; Chae, Sangmin; Lee, Hanbin; Kim, Hyo Jung			The synergistic effect of cooperating solvent vapor annealing for high-efficiency planar inverted perovskite solar cells	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							SPRAY DEPOSITION; THIN-FILMS; CH3NH3PBI3; MORPHOLOGY; SURFACE; GROWTH; PHASE; ORIENTATION; EVOLUTION; MOISTURE	Solvent vapor annealing (SVA) is an effective post-treatment process to improve the quality of crystals and grains in metal halide perovskite films. Whereas SVA has been successfully adopted for the fabrication of perovskite films via the conventional two-step method, its adaptation to the simple single-step perovskite film deposition method has been limited because of the rapid transition of the precursor to the perovskite structure. In the present study, we demonstrate highly efficient and stable single-stepbased inverted perovskite solar cells fabricated with perovskite films prepared using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and water as a combined solvent in SVA treatment. The treatment with DMSO alone resulted in the growth of large grains (similar to 900 nm) in the lateral direction at the surface region; however, voids and defects were observed in the vertical direction at the bottom interfacial region of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer, which resulted in poor device properties. Interestingly, the combined DMSO-water induced vertical growth of almost single grains and the healing effect of water improved the grain quality. As a result, we fabricated co-SVA CH3NH3PbI3 devices with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.52%. This PCE, which is much higher than that of pristine devices, was attributed to reduced nonradiative recombination. In addition, co-SVA solar cells displayed remarkable stability and their universality in various types of perovskite materials was demonstrated. We anticipate that our proposed process and mechanism will be widely used in the future development of perovskite-based devices.

Efforts to increase power conversion efficiency (PCE) have been continuously made. As a result, a record PCE of 25.2% was certified in 2019, which surpassed those achieved from the conventional solar cells based on CIGS and CdTe. The superb photovoltaic performance of PSC is related to the defect-tolerant property, the long carrier lifetime, the long diffusion length of photo-generated carriers, and the high absorption coefficient. In this review, materials and devices engineering are described for achieving stability and higher PCE in PSCs. From the practical point of view, key technologies for materials, coating, and device fabrication are described, which is expected to be helpful to achieve high efficiency PSCs. Moreover, interfacial engineering methodologies toward hysteresis-less and stable PSCs are also presented to give insight into better understanding ion migration and recombination in PSCs.

Hence, the challenge remains to enhance the PCE utilizing near infrared (NIR) light in the solar light spectrum. One of the easiest ways to utilize the NIR is to incorporate NIR active materials in PSCs such as up-conversion nanoparticles (UCNPs); however, such a stratergy is not simple to adopt in PSCs due to the inherent vurnerability of perovskite materials towards moisture. In this work, we present NIR-utilizing PSCs by locating UCNPs within the PSC structure by a simple dry transfer method. A maximum PCE of 15.56% was obtained in the case of PSC having the UCNPs located between the hole transport layer (HTL) and gold (Au) top electrode, which is an 8.4% enhancement compared to the cell without the UCNPs. This enhancement came from the combined effects of NIR light utilization and the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) phenomenon originating from the Au top electrode, which was interfacing the UCNPs.

However, the electrical properties of the 2D structure as a passivation layer on the 3D perovskite thin film and resistance to the penetration of moisture may vary depending on the length of the alkyl chain. In addition, the surface defects of the 2D itself on the 3D layer may also be affected by the correlation between the 2D structure and the hole conductive material. Therefore, systematic interfacial study with the alkyl chain length of long-chained alkylammonium iodide forming a 2D structure is necessary. Herein, the 2D interfacial layers formed are compared with butylammonium iodide (BAI), octylammonium iodide (OAI), and dodecylammonium iodide (DAI) iodide on a 3D (FAPbI(3))(0.95)(MAPbBr(3))(0.05) perovskite thin film in terms of the PCE and humidity stability. As the length of the alkyl chain increased from BA to OA to DA, the electron-blocking ability and humidity resistance increase significantly, but the difference between OA and DA is not large. The PSC post-treated with OAI has slightly higher PCE than those treated with BAI and DAI, achieving a certified stabilized efficiency of 22.9%.

To further increase their performance, a wider bandgap PV structure such as indium gallium phosphide (InGaP) has been integrated in two-terminal (2T) tandem configuration. However, it increases the overall fabrication cost, complicated tunnel-junction diode connecting subcells are inevitable, and materials are limited by lattice matching. Here, high-efficiency and stable wide-bandgap perovskite PVs having comparable bandgap to InGaP (1.8-1.9 eV) are developed, which can be stable low-cost add-on layers to further enhance the performance of GaAs PVs as tandem configurations by showing an efficiency improvement from 21.68% to 24.27% (2T configuration) and 25.19% (4T configuration). This approach is also feasible for thin-film GaAs PV, essential to reduce its fabrication cost for commercialization, with performance increasing from 21.85% to 24.32% and superior flexibility (1000 times bending) in a tandem configuration. Additionally, potential routes to over 30% stable perovskite/GaAs tandems, comparable to InGaP/GaAs with lower cost, are considered. This work can be an initial step to reach the objective of improving the usability of GaAs PV technology with enhanced performance for applications for which lightness and flexibility are crucial, without a significant additional cost increase.

On the other hand, inorganic HTL secures better stability, while it offers difficulties in the deposition and interfacial control to realize high performing devices. In this study, we demonstrate polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as an ideal polymeric interlayer which prevents interfacial degradation and improves both photovoltaic performance and stability of CuSCN-based PSC by its cross-linking behavior. Surprisingly, the PDMS polymers are identified to form chemical bonds with perovskite and CuSCN, as shown by Raman spectroscopy. This novel cross-linking interlayer of PDMS enhances the hole-transporting property at the interface and passivates the interfacial defects, realizing the PSC with high power-conversion efficiency over 19%. Furthermore, the utilization of the PDMS interlayer greatly improves the stability of solar cells against both humidity and heat by mitigating the interfacial defects and interdiffusion. The PDMS-interlayered PSCs retained over 90% of the initial efficiencies, both after 1000 h under ambient conditions (unencapsulated) and after 500 h under 85 degrees C/85% relative humidity (encapsulated).

J	Jung, MH				Jung, Mi-Hee			Stacking of Layered Halide Perovskite from Incorporating a Diammonium Cation into Three-Dimensional Perovskites	LANGMUIR			English	Article							FORMAMIDINIUM LEAD IODIDE; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; SOLAR; PERFORMANCE; TIN; TRIHALIDE; LENGTHS; GROWTH; CL	Quasi two-dimensional (2D) layered perovskites have been emerging as promising candidates for photovoltaic cells because they exhibit intrinsic stability and a higher tunability of optical properties compared to three-dimensional (3D) perovskites. However, since most 2D perovskites have bulkier groups as an organic space group, they will inevitably have a van der Waals gap between the inorganic layers and their crystal growth directions orient in a lateral direction. It also interrupts carrier transport across the conducting inorganic layer in the solar cell. Here, we presents the new homologous 2D layered perovskites, (HA)-(A)(n-1)PbnI3n+1, where HA stands for the histammonium ((C5N3H11)(2+)) as a diammonium cation and A stands for methylammonium (CH3NH3+) or formammonium (HC(NH2)(2)(+)). Since the ditopic HA has a diammoinium cation, it connects the inorganic slabs stacked in the vertical direction. The inorganic layer is stacked on the other layer to form a layered structure, which results in rigid and stable structures. These materials (1.64 eV for (HA)(FA)(n-1)PbnI3n+1 and 1.80 eV for (HA)(MA)(n-1)PbnI3n+1) have significantly lower band gaps than those of HAPbI(4) (2.20 eV). Compared to the pure 2D and 3D perovskites, these perovskites have a longer electron lifetime due to the vertical crystal structure and show improved environmental stability for perovskite solar cell application.

J	Mali, SS; Patil, JV; Hong, CK				Mali, Sawanta S.; Patil, Jyoti V.; Hong, Chang Kook			Simultaneous Improved Performance and Thermal Stability of Planar Metal Ion Incorporated CsPbI2Br All-Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells Based on MgZnO Nanocrystalline Electron Transporting Layer	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						degradation; MgZnO electron transporting layer; Mn2+ incorporated CsPbI2Br	HIGHLY EFFICIENT; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; SELECTIVE CONTACT; STABLE CSPBI3; QUANTUM DOTS; PHASE; FILMS; ALPHA-CSPBI3; INSTABILITY; DEPOSITION	The high thermal stability and facile synthesis of CsPbI2Br all-inorganic perovskite solar cells (AI-PSCs) have attracted tremendous attention. As far as electron-transporting layers (ETLs) are concerned, low temperature processing and reduced interfacial recombination centers through tunable energy levels determine the feasibility of the perovskite devices. Although the TiO2 is the most popular ETL used in PSCs, its processing temperature and moderate electron mobility hamper the performance and feasibility. Herein, the highly stable, low-temperature processed MgZnO nanocrystal-based ETLs for dynamic hot-air processed Mn2+ incorporated CsPbI2Br AI-PSCs are reported. By holding its regular planar "n-i-p" type device architecture, the MgZnO ETL and poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) hole transporting layer, 15.52% power conversion efficiency (PCE) is demonstrated. The thermal-stability analysis reveals that the conventional ZnO ETL-based AI-PSCs show a serious instability and poor efficiency than the Mg2+ modified MgZnO ETLs. The photovoltaic and stability analysis of this improved photovoltaic performance is attributed to the suitable wide-bandgap, low ETL/perovskite interface recombination, and interface stability by Mg2+ doping. Interestingly, the thermal stability analysis of the unencapsulated AI-PSCs maintains >95% of initial PCE more than 400 h at 85 degrees C for MgZnO ETL, revealing the suitability against thermal degradation than conventional ZnO ETL.

In recent years, Bi-based chalcohalides are being considered as potential alternative candidates, however, their current device efficiency remains unsatisfactory. Herein, a two-step solution method is developed and applied to the fabrication of BiSI films. The method consists of the formation of Bi2S3 (step I) and its conversion to BiSI (step II). The Bi2S3 was fabricated by a thiol-amine solution process and the BiSI conversion was achieved by chemical reaction between the as-formed Bi2S3 and BiI3. It was found that the formation of BiSI was highly dependent on the Bi:S molar ratio of the Bi2O3-thiourea solution and the number of times of step I. The as-fabricated BiSI film had an optical band gap of 1.61 eV and exhibited nanorod morphology. In addition, the electronic structure is explored and discussed for solar cells applications.

J	Chae, S; Yi, A; Kim, HJ				Chae, Sangmin; Yi, Ahra; Kim, Hyo Jung			Molecular engineering of a conjugated polymer as a hole transporting layer for versatile p-i-n perovskite solar cells	MATERIALS TODAY ENERGY			English	Article						Perovskite solar cell; Organic semiconductor; Conjugated polymer; Molecular engineering; Solvent process; Flexible device	HIGHLY EFFICIENT; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; STABILITY; EMERGENCE; FULLERENE	Along with the development of perovskite materials, which have enormous potential for optoelectronics such as solar cells and light-emitting diode devices, numerous organic semiconductor polymers, which have been critically adopted into the hole and electron transporting layers, have been synthesized and studied. In n-i-p-structured perovskite solar cells, various outstanding polymer materials have been successfully applied. However, in p-i-n-structured solar cells, the hydrophobic nature of the polymers makes the sequential deposition of a perovskite thin film difficult. Several destructive methods have been proposed; however, a more efficacious and fundamental method is urgently needed. Here, we present a nondestructive polymer hole-transporting layer (HTL) thin-film formation process based on molecular engineering via a simple solvent process. When we used various solvents with different volatilities, perovskite film formation was achieved on polymer thin films formed from highly volatile solvents. In addition, we elucidated the structure and orientation of the molecules in the films and revealed that the molecular structure of face-on orientation for the horizontally aligned hydrophobic alkyl groups induced a lower surface energy of the film, as determined by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements. Furthermore, the tilt angle of the molecules, which was calculated from the results of quantitative near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) analysis, was found to correlate with the surface energy. This result provides guidance for polymer-orientation and surface-energy studies, and perovskite solar cells fabricated using the polymer HTL demonstrated good durability and flexibility. We expect that our approach represents a new route for fabricating p-i-n-structured solar cells and that numerous valuable p-type conjugated polymers will be developed via our proposed molecular engineering process.

Here we report ternary diagrams of the phase, optical bandgap energy (E-g) and photoluminescence intensity of methylammonium lead halide (MAPbX(3), where X=I, Br and Cl) perovskites, with three vertices of MAPbl(3), MAPbBr(3) and MAPbCl(3). All the compositions were synthesized via a facile mechanochemical reaction at room temperature, to ensure the desired stoichiometries of the final products. Through structural study on MAPbX(3), the phase diagram comprising a single phase region and two multi-phase regions was obtained. In the single phase region, the a-axis lattice constant increases almost linearly with increasing the average size of the X site ions. Interestingly, Eg decreases almost linearly with increasing the average size of the X site ions, giving negligible deviation from Vegard's law. As the result, a certain bandgap value, in the range of 1.55 - 2.9 eV, can be easily designed with infinite numbers of compositions. For the last, the ternary diagram of the photoluminescence intensity reveals the effective compositions for red, green and blue light emission. The comprehensive structural and optical information reported in this study is useful for designing halide perovskites for various applications. In addition, our approach for compositional mapping various characteristics using a solid-state reaction is an efficient and robust way to studying halide perovskites. (C) 2019 Acta Materialia Inc.

Effective Preparation of Nanoscale CH3NH3PbI3 Perovskite Photosensitizers for Mesoporous TiO2-Based Solar Cells by Successive Precursor Layer Adsorption and Reaction Process	ENERGY TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						nanoscale perovskites; photosensitizers; solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells; successive adsorption and reaction	HALIDE PEROVSKITE; GAME-CHANGER; EFFICIENCY; FILMS; PBI2; RECOMBINATION; SENSITIZERS; STABILITY; PBS	Nanoscale CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite sensitizers are grown by delivering each precursor successively onto the surface of mesoporous (meso) TiO2 electrodes. Using Pb(NO3)(2) ions as a lead(II) source and CH3NH3I (MAI) for methylammonium and iodide sources, repetitive cycles of the two dipping steps are successful in growing few nanometer-sized MAPbI(3) gradually on the TiO2 surface inside the meso-TiO2 film. However, some aggregates are observed on the top surface of the meso-TiO2 film due to slight dissolution of PbI2 and its accumulation/reaction with MAI at the top surface of the meso-TiO2 film. To solve this inhomogeneity of the deposition, a nondestructive multiple deposition route for nanoscale MAPbI(3) is suggested as a successive precursor layer adsorption and reaction (SPLAR) process where, from the second cycle of deposition, PbI2 is delivered with the help of an ionic liquid compound dissolved in dichloromethane. With this new Pb precursor in less-polar solvents, nanoscale MAPbI(3) sensitizers are grown without dissolution of preformed perovskites or formation of some aggregates at the top surface. After the third cycle of SPLAR deposition, about 7.0 nm-sized MAPbI(3) sensitizers are prepared and display enhanced photovoltaic performance (7.18 +/- 0.31%) compared with devices obtained from only one cycle (5.74 +/- 0.30%).

By forming PEO-MAPbI(3) composites, we achieved controllability of the perovskite surface morphology. Furthermore, the PEO addition improved the electronic properties of the composites by suppressing the trap density of the MAPbI(3) perovskite. We observed a significant increase in the average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) from 0.24% to 7.25% using the proper PEO-perovskite composition ratio (1.5:1), based on their fabrication without any organic anti-solvent treatment. Moreover, the performance uniformity and outdoor stability were significantly enhanced by employing the composite. The proposed PEO-perovskite composite offers a promising pathway for the industrialization of PVSCs in terms of PCE, uniformity, stability, and feasibility-without involving current anti-solvent washing process.

Despite the high power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) using a TiO2 electron transport layer, the MAPI/TiO2 interface is believed as an electron accumulation position during device operation. To elucidate the cause of the electron accumulation, the energy level alignment at the MAPI/TiO2 interface should be understood. However, a buried MAPI/TiO2 interface forms after a thick MAPI layer deposition; thus, the electronic structure of the MAPI/TiO2 interface cannot be measured using surface-sensitive photoelectron spectroscopy in a conventional stack-up manner. In this study, we investigated the electronic structure of a buried MAPI/TiO2 interface by removing the MAPI and organic layers using solvent immersion. As a result, we reveal that a conduction band minimum (CBM) mismatch occurs owing to the Ti-O-Pb bonding on the TiO2 surface.

Herein, highly efficient and stable PSCs based on perovskite/Ag-reduced graphene oxide (Ag-rGO) and mesoporous Al2O3/graphene (mp-AG) composites are reported. The mp-AG composite is conductive with one-order of magnitude higher mobility than mp-TiO2 and used for electron transport layer (ETL). Compared to the mp-TiO2 ETL based cells, the champion device based on perovskite/Ag-rGO and SrTiO3/mp-AG composites shows overall a best performance (i.e., V-OC = 1.057 V, J(SC) = 25.75 mA cm(-2), fill factor (FF) = 75.63%, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) = 20.58%). More importantly, the champion device without encapsulation exhibits not only remarkable thermal- and photostability but also long-term stability, retaining 97-99% of the initial values of photovoltaic parameters and sustaining approximate to 93% of initial PCE over 300 d under ambient conditions.

As a result, a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.2% was recorded in 2019. Publications on PSCs have increased exponentially since 2012 and the total number of publications reached over 13200 as of August 2019. PCE has improved by developing device structures from mesoscopic sensitization to planar p-i-n (or n-i-p) junction and by changing composition from MAPbI(3) to FAPbI(3)-based mixed cations and/or mixed anion perovskites. Long-term stability has been significantly improved by interfacial engineering with hydrophobic materials or the 2D/3D concept. Although small area cells exhibit superb efficiency, scale-up technology is required toward commercialization. In this review, research direction toward large-area, stable, high efficiency PSCs is emphasized. For large-area perovskite coating, a precursor solution is equally important as coating methods. Precursor engineering and formulation of the precursor solution are described. For hysteresis-less, stable, and higher efficiency PSCs, interfacial engineering is one of the best ways as defects can be effectively passivated and thereby nonradiative recombination is efficiently reduced. Methodologies are introduced to minimize interfacial and grain boundary recombination.

Here, the causes of intrinsic and extrinsic instability of perovskite materials are reviewed considering their correlation with the unique chemical-bonding nature of perovskite materials. There are a number of key standardized stability tests established by the International Electrotechnical Commission for commercialized photovoltaic modules. Based on these procedures, the possible causes and related mechanisms of the material degradation that can arise during the test procedures are identified, which are discussed in terms of their chemical bonds. Based on the understanding of the critical causes, promising strategies for mitigating the causes to enhance the stability of perovskite solar cells are summarized. The stability of the state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells implies a need for the development of improved stability-testing protocols to move onto the next stage toward commercialization.

Despite rapid development in this field, further increasing their power conversion efficiency (PCE) remains a critical issue for the commercialization of PSCs. Herein, the application of Ag nanoparticle (NP) layers via vapor-phase deposition onto perovskite active layers is investigated. The formation of unique, crescent-shaped Ag NPs is confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which shows that the NPs self-assemble along the grain boundaries of perovskite, leading to their unique shape. The PCE for devices incorporating an optimized size of Ag NPs of 79 +/- 6 nm increase from 11.63% to 13.46% with an improvement factor of 15.74%. The increase in PCE is can be attributed to an increase in short-circuit current density (J(sc)) that is assigned to an increase in optical path length and absorption. NPs exhibit the ability to increase the optical path length of photons in the device due to the near-field and far-field enhancement (plasmonic scattering) and consequently may act to improve the photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (Delta IPCE) and PCE of PSCs. Moreover, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy reveals a decrease in hole injection barrier (phi(h)), which also contributes to enhanced performance.

We herein demonstrated a solution-processed spinel CuCo2O4 as a hole transport layer to use in high-performance perovskite solar cells. The solution-processed CuCo2O4 possessed high electrical conductivity, high optical transparency in UV-vis-NIR, well-matched energy levels to perovskite, and efficient hole transport capability to the perovskite layer. The optoelectronic properties of CuCo2O4 were finely controlled by optimizing the annealing temperature, leading to a 14.12% power conversion efficiency in planar perovskite solar cells. Another impressive advantage for the CuCo2O4-based hole transport layer is a negligible hysteresis of the device at very low scan rate, which brought about highly stable and reliable photovoltaic performance. All of the results studied in this work suggest a bright future for solution-processed CuCo2O4 as a novel hole transport layer in perovskite solar cells with high efficiency and good stability.

Herein, earth-abundant NiMoFe (NMF) and phosphorized NiMoFeP (NMFP) are synthesized as complementary overall water splitting (OWS) catalysts. First, NMF is tested as both the HER and OER promoter, which exhibits low overpotentials of 68 (HER) and 337 mV (OER). A quaternary NMFP is then prepared by simple phosphorization of NMF, which shows a much lower OER overpotential of 286 mV. The enhanced OER activity is attributed to the unique surface/core structure of NMFP. The surface phosphate acts as a proton transport mediator and expedites the rate-determining step. With the application of OER potential, the NMFP surface is composed of Ni(OH)(2) and FeOOH, active sites for OER, but the inner core consists of Ni, Mo, and Fe metals, serving as a conductive electron pathway. OWS with NMF-NMFP requires an applied voltage of 1.452 V to generate 10 mA cm(-2), which is one of the lowest values among OWS results with transition-metal-based electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the catalysts are combined with tandem perovskite solar cells for photovoltaic (PV)-electrolysis, producing a high solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 12.3%.

Although a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 22.7% is certified for perovskite solar cells (PSCs), it is still far from the theoretical Shockley-Queisser limit efficiency (30.5%). Obviously, trap-assisted nonradiative (also called Shockley-Read-Hall, SRH) recombination in perovskite films and interface recombination should be mainly responsible for the above efficiency distance. Here, recent research advancements in suppressing bulk SRH recombination and interface recombination are systematically investigated. For reducing SRH recombination in the films, engineering perovskite composition, additives, dimensionality, grain orientation, nonstoichiometric approach, precursor solution, and post-treatment are explored. The focus herein is on the recombination at perovskite/electron-transporting material and perovskite/hole-transporting material interfaces in normal or inverted PSCs. Strategies for suppressing bulk and interface recombination are described. Additionally, the effect of trap-assisted nonradiative recombination on hysteresis and stability of PSCs is discussed. Finally, possible solutions and reasonable prospects for suppressing recombination losses are presented.

Since the first development of MHP light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) in 2014, many researchers have tried to understand the properties of MHP emitters and the limitations to luminescence efficiency (LE) of PeLEDs, and have devoted efforts to increase the LE of MHP emitters and PeLEDs. Within three and half years, PeLEDs have shown rapidly increased LE from external quantum efficiency approximate to 0.1% to approximate to 14.36%. Herein, the factors that limit the LE of PeLEDs are reviewed; the factors are characterized into the following groups: i) photophysical properties of MHP crystals, ii) morphological factors of MHP layers, and iii) problems caused by device architectures. Then, the strategies to overcome those luminescence-limiting factors in MHP emitters and PeLEDs are critically evaluated. Finally, research directions to further increase the LE of MHP emitters and the potential of MHPs as a core component in next-generation displays and solid-state lightings are suggested.

Despite SnO2 is a commonly used electron transport materials for perovskite solar cells due to wide band gap and n-type semiconducting property, shallow conduction band edge and low electrical conductivity of pristine SnO2 limit the full potential for efficient electron extraction from perovskite absorber. To improve the electrical property of SnO2, we design and synthesize Zr-doped SnO2 nanoparticles, in which tailored electronic structure affords enhanced conductivity, adjusted energy levels and excellence in electron extraction capability. Consequently, the champion device employing Zr-doped SnO2 nanoparticles achieves a power conversion efficiency of 19.54%, while the pristine SnO2 nanoparticles yield 17.30% under 100mWcm(-2) illumination. The systematic device analyses confirm that Zr-doped SnO2 delivers reduced interfacial resistance, reduced current leakage and suppressed charge recombination, which leads to not only the enhanced power conversion efficiency but also reduced hysteresis for the planar perovskite solar cells.

Flexibility and semi-transparency of the perovskite solar cells are challenged to integrate with the flexible electronic devices since the perovskite solar cells have discovered. Herein, we provide the first report of transfer-free, large-scale monolayer graphene employed as a transparent and flexible bottom electrode. High-quality graphene without transfer process was directly synthesized at 150 degrees C on a polymer substrate via plasma assisted thermal chemical vapor deposition (PATCVD). Additionally, a highly transparent AZO/Ag/AZO (AAA) multilayer was utilized as a top counter electrode to create semi-transparent perovskite solar cells with a remarkable degree of mechanical flexibility. The 300 nm-thick perovskite solar cells with PATCVD-Graphene revealed a high transmittance of similar to 26% at a wavelength of 700 nm. The highest level of power conversion efficiency (PCE) (similar to 14.2%) was recorded by an illumination from the bottom graphene side. After 1000 bending cycles under a tensile strain of 1.5%, the graphene-based devices maintained a level of PCE that was more than 90% greater than the initial reading. This superior bending robustness highlights the potential for non-transfer, graphene-based, perovskite photovoltaic material to establish a tandem structure for a foldable solar cell.

ZnO has been recognized as the promising electron transport layer (ETL) that may overcome the limitations of the conventional TiO2. However, methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)) perovskite is prone to decomposition at the ZnO surface, which hinders the development of simple one-step deposition of perovskite, resulting in the limited photovoltaic performance. Herein, we report interlayer mediated efficient ETLs for viable flexible PSCs. The utilization of polyethyleneimine ethoxylated layer on ZnO prevents the direct contact between the perovskite and Ells, avoiding the photoactive layer decomposition. Thus, interlayer-mediated PSCs show higher efficiency with enhanced stability by decreasing the electron transport barrier. As a result, the PSC employing tailor-designed ETL interfaces exhibited average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.8%, which was superior by 25.4%	[Lim, Ju Won; Wang, Huan; Choi, Chi Hun; Chung, Kyungwha; Kim, Dong Ha] Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Chem & Nano Sci, 52 Ewhayeodae Gil, Seoul 03760, South Korea; [Lim, Ju Won] Univ Michigan, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Quan, Li Na] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Park, Won-Tae] Dongguk Univ, Dept Energy Mat & Engn, 30 Pildong Ro,1 Gil, Seoul 04620, South Korea; [Chung, Kyungwha] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Energy Sci, Suwon 16419, South Korea; [Wang, Huan] Northeast Petr Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Daqing 163318, Peoples R China; [Noh, Yong-Young] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Dept Chem Engn, 77 Cheongam Ro, Pohang 37673, South Korea[Lim, Ju Won; Wang, Huan; Choi, Chi Hun; Chung, Kyungwha; Kim, Dong Ha] Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Chem & Nano Sci, 52 Ewhayeodae Gil, Seoul 03760, South Korea; [Lim, Ju Won] Univ Michigan, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Quan, Li Na] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Park, Won-Tae] Dongguk Univ, Dept Energy Mat & Engn, 30 Pildong Ro,1 Gil, Seoul 04620, South Korea; [Chung, Kyungwha] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Energy Sci, Suwon 16419, South Korea; [Wang, Huan] Northeast Petr Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Daqing 163318, Peoples R China; [Noh, Yong-Young] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Dept Chem Engn, 77 Cheongam Ro, Pohang 37673, South Korea	Kim, DH (reprint author), Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Chem & Nano Sci, 52 Ewhayeodae Gil, Seoul 03760, South Korea.	dhkim@ewha.ac.krdhkim@ewha.ac.kr	Quan, Lina/AAE-7649-2019; Kim, Dong Ha/B-3778-2008	Quan, Lina/0000-0001-9301-3764; Kim, Dong Ha/0000-0003-0444-0479	National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean GovernmentNational Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government [2017R1A2A1A05022387, 2015M1A2A2058365]; Creative Materials Discovery Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT [2018M3D1A1058536]; Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) of the Republic of Korea [20173010013340]; Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE) of the Republic of Korea [20173010013340]	This work was supported by National Research Foundation of Korea Grants funded by the Korean Government (2017R1A2A1A05022387, 2015M1A2A2058365), by Creative Materials Discovery Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by Ministry of Science and ICT (2018M3D1A1058536) and by the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) and the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE) of the Republic of Korea (No. 20173010013340).		51	4	4	20	39	ELSEVIER	AMSTERDAM	RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS	0378-7753	1873-2755		J POWER SOURCES	J.

However, the electrical properties of the 2D structure as a passivation layer on the 3D perovskite thin film and resistance to the penetration of moisture may vary depending on the length of the alkyl chain. In addition, the surface defects of the 2D itself on the 3D layer may also be affected by the correlation between the 2D structure and the hole conductive material. Therefore, systematic interfacial study with the alkyl chain length of long-chained alkylammonium iodide forming a 2D structure is necessary. Herein, the 2D interfacial layers formed are compared with butylammonium iodide (BAI), octylammonium iodide (OAI), and dodecylammonium iodide (DAI) iodide on a 3D (FAPbI(3))(0.95)(MAPbBr(3))(0.05) perovskite thin film in terms of the PCE and humidity stability. As the length of the alkyl chain increased from BA to OA to DA, the electron-blocking ability and humidity resistance increase significantly, but the difference between OA and DA is not large. The PSC post-treated with OAI has slightly higher PCE than those treated with BAI and DAI, achieving a certified stabilized efficiency of 22.9%.

Impedance spectroscopy (IS) has been key to characterizing photovoltaic devices; however, its application to PSCs has generated misleading outputs. In this work, we control the precursor concentrations to fabricate a series of PSCs with different amounts of perovskite absorber. While lower concentration devices present the well-known dye-sensitized impedance pattern, the characteristic impedance spectrum of thin-film PSCs arises for higher concentrations. The capacitances' evolution is employed to identify the dominant physical processes in the spectrum and reveals that it is not possible to assign a single physical origin to each individual feature. On the contrary, their resistances present contributions from different physical processes, including charge transport and recombination. We provide an equivalent circuit to evaluate the IS of PSCs in terms of the processes directly affecting their performance, a tool for further development of perovskite photovoltaics.

The semi-transparent perovskite solar cells using an indium zinc tin oxide electrode as a novel top electrode achieves a power conversion efficiency of 12.85%, similar to that of an opaque electrode-based device of 13.48%. More importantly, by adjusting the perovskite thickness, a power conversion efficiency of 8.306% is obtained at an average visible transmittance of 33.9%, thus well supporting that the indium zinc tin oxide electrode can be considered to be an advanced and efficient semi-transparent top electrode for the fabrication of building integrated photovoltaics with high efficiency and good transparency.

Organic lead halide single crystals having a bandgap ranging from 2.16 to 1.45 eV were grown by inverse temperature crystallization. The shallow trap energy level of MAPbBr(2.5)I(0.5) was E-v + 0.06 eV. The deep level traps of MAPbBr(3) and MAPbI(3) were E-v + 1.24 and E-v + 0.84 eV, respectively. The deep level traps of organic lead halide may have decreased the reactivity between iodide and bromide ions in the crystal lattice. Varying the ratio of halides in the perovskite can change the defect species in the crystals and can increase the photoconversion efficiency by decreasing the density of deep level traps.

Furthermore, most of presented high efficiency PSCs utilize an antisolvent-strategy to assist perovskite crystal growth with large grain-size and excellent coverage. To solve such issues, we developed fullyambient-air and antisolvent-free processes for the fabrication of PSCs with perovskite-based composites (i.e., MAPbI(3-x)Cl(x)-Cu:NiO, MAPbI(3-x)Cl(x)-Cu:NiO-carbon-graphite and MAPbI(3-x)Cl(x)-Al2O3). Such perovskite composites based cells with interface engineering yielded high power-conversion-efficiency (PCE) of 18.6% and fill factor (FF) of 78.3% with excellent reproducibility. More importantly, the target cells showed hysteresis-free behavior and dramatic enhancement in air-, photo- and thermal-stability. Compared to the pristine cells, the target device showed remarkable long-term stability with retaining almost 100% of the initial values of V-oc and J(sc) and similar to 94% of FF and PCE over 280 days.

To elucidate the local environment of the cations, temperature-dependent chemical shifts and spin-lattice relaxation times are measured using H-1 magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) and C-13 cross-polarization/MAS NMR techniques. The chemical shifts of H-1 and C-13 decrease with increasing temperature, which indicates that the environment around H-1 and C-13 changes with temperature. Moreover, the H-1 and C-13 spin-lattice relaxation times T-1 rho increase significantly at high temperatures. These T-1 rho results reveal that the cations are subject to high mobility at high temperatures. A comparison of the molecular dynamics of (CH3NH3)(2)CuX4 (X=Br, Cl) crystals is made, together with a discussion of the effect of substituting Cl ions for the Br ions in the structure.

CF-Sp-BTh exhibited relatively high hole mobility and favorable HOMO level with respect to the valence band of CH3NH3PbI3. iPHSC using CF-Sp-BTh HTM and GO (0.5 wt%)-CH3NH3PbI3 achieved the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of similar to 14.28%, with open circuit voltage (V-OC) of similar to 1.07 V and a short circuit current density (J(SC)) of similar to 18.82 mA/cm(2). The photovoltaic performance of FTO/CF-Sp-BTh/GO- (0.5 wt%)-CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM/Au was higher compared to pristine CH3NH3PbI3 and other GO-CH3NH3PbI3 hybrid based devices. The photoluminescence decay and electrochemical impedance spectra confirmed an enhanced charge separation and retarded charge recombination of GO-CH3NH3PbI3 hybrid based iPHSCs.

Herein, high-quality Cs(x)FA(1-x)PbI(3) perovskite films with different compositions (x = 0, 5, 10, and 15) are achieved by controlling the amount of cesium chloride (CsCl) in the respective FAPbI(3) precursor solution. The effects of CsCl addition on the morphological and optoelectronic properties of the resulting perovskite films and on the performance of the corresponding devices are systematically studied. Introduction of CsCl into FAPbI(3) shows a great potential to stabilize the alpha-FAPbI(3) perovskite phase by forming Cs(x)FA(1-x)PbI(3) films with improved morphology and carrier lifetimes. With an optimal 10 mol% CsCl additive, the average power conversion efficiency (PCE) is increased from 16.83 +/- 0.30% for the reference FAPbI(3)-based PSCs to 18.87 +/- 0.25% (with a steady-state PCE of 18.89%). Moreover, the optimized device performance is more stable after 20 days than the controlled one under approximate to 40% humidity in air.

To overcome these limitations, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and C-60-encapsulated SWNTs (C-60@SVVNTs) are incorporated into the HTL in CQDPVs. SWNT-incorporated CQDPV demonstrates a significantly improved short-circuit current density (J(SC)), and C-60@SWNT-incorporated CQDPV exhibits an even higher J(SC) than that of pristine SWNT. Both result in improved power-conversion efficiencies. Hole-selective, photoinduced charge extraction with linearly increasing voltage measurements demonstrates that SWNT or C-60@SWNT incorporation improves hole-transporting behavior, rendering suppressed charge recombination and enhanced mobility of the HTL. The enhanced p-type characteristics and the improved hole diffusion lengths of SWNT- or C-60@SWNT-incorporated HTL bring improvement of the entire hole-transporting length and enable lossless hole collection, which results in the J(SC) enhancement of the CQDPVs.

Here, we demonstrate a facile but effective method for surface engineering of nickel oxide thin film, which enables improved film morphology with the optimal electronic states allowing substantial reduction of defects between the interface of perovskite and the hole transport layer. As a result, a substantial improvement in hole extraction, transport, and collection properties is achieved by the surface engineering of nickel oxide thin film, leading to the increased power conversion efficiency from 12.30% to 17.03% of the planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells. In addition, this work reveals that the improved surface properties suppress charge recombination at the interface of perovskite/nickel oxide, which is attributed to proper band alignment, superior hole extraction, and decreased resistance for charge transfer.

In this work, we introduce a ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) interlayer between phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and a metal electrode in order to reduce the interface loss due to charge recombination and device degradation, and also investigate the dependence of device performance on the thickness and morphology of the PCBM and PCBM/ZnO electron transport bilayer. After achieving optimized PCBM and ZnO thickness, the PCBM/ZnO bilayer-based devices reached an average power conversion efficiency of 15.63% (Max. 16.39%) with an open circuit voltage of 1.05 V, short circuit current density of 18.69 mA cm(-2), and fill factor of 79.95%. In addition, hysteresis behavior and atmospheric stability are significantly improved by the incorporation of a PCBM/ZnO bilayer. Therefore, the implementation of a PCBM/ZnO electron transport bilayer is a promising approach toward achieving a high-efficiency PSC with stable power output (low J-V hysteresis) and durability.

In this paper, a novel approach to synthesize nitrogen-and oxygen-doped GQDs (NO-GQDs) is presented. Nitrogen and oxygen are mainly bound at the GQD edges, resulting in high crystallinity and good electrical properties. A simple solvothermal reaction using N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), whose surface energy is similar to that of graphite as a raw material, can simultaneously exfoliate, cut, and finally transform the graphite into the GQDs with heteroatoms derived from the decomposed NMP solution. The synthesized NO-GQDs have a less defective and more selectively edge-functionalized structure compared to other reported GQDs. The electrical properties of NO-GQDs are investigated using them as the additive of hole-transporting materials (HTMs) in an optoelectronic device such as perovskite solar cells (PeSCs). Compared with PEDOT:PSS, a mixture of NO-GQDs and PEDOT:PSS shows a 36.2% increase in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) (maximum PCE: 11.47%) and good device stability. Therefore, it is believed that the improvement of photovoltaics is solely attributed from NO-GQDs which act as a positive role of faster hole transfer. We could confirm that the NO-GQDs facilitate hole-extraction from a photoactive layer and guarantee the more stable operation of PeSCs.

However, the high sintering temperature of TiO2 nanoparticles required to remove binders from the TiO2 paste limits PSC application to flexible electronics. In this study, a simple interface modification process involving ethanol rinsing is developed to enhance the photovoltaic characteristics of low-temperature processed PSCs. This easy and fast technique could enable remarkable performance by PSCs by significantly increasing the fill factor and current density, leading to a power conversion efficiency more than four times that of untreated solar cells.

The power conversion efficiency (PCE) is increased from 18.4 to 20.8% after introduction of (3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane (MPTS) containing a -SH group as a consequence of improved voltage and current density, while 3-cyanopropyltriethoxysilane (CPTS) containing a -CN group deteriorates the overall photovoltaic performance. Moreover, -SH in MPTS is found to passivate defects effectively through a Lewis acid-base interaction with PbI2, resulting in a larger grain size and a longer carrier lifetime. Owing to the formation of a cross-linking siloxane network as a protective layer on the grain boundary, the thermal and moisture stability of the device are improved remarkably. The present work provides a guideline for multifunctional additive engineering for the purpose of simultaneous achievement of a high PCE and long-term stability.

However, conventional spin-coating and solvent-engineering processes in a controlled inert atmosphere hamper the upscaling. In this study, we demonstrated a dynamic hot-air (DHA) casting process to control the morphology and stability of all-inorganic PSCs which is processed under ambient conditions and free from conventional harmful antisolvents. Furthermore, CsPbI2Br perovskite was doped with barium (Ba2+) alkaline earth metal cations (BaI2:CsPbI2Br). This DHA method facilitates the formation of uniform grain and controlled crystallization that makes stable all-inorganic PSCs which enables an intact black a-phase under ambient conditions. The DHA-processed BaI2:CsPbI2Br perovskite photovoltaics shows the champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.85% (reverse scan) for a small exposure area of 0.09 cm(2) and 13.78% for a large area of 1 X 1 cm(2) with excellent reproducibility. Interestingly, the hot-air-processed devices retain >92% of the initial efficiency after 300 h. This DHA method facilitates a wide processing window for upscaling the all-inorganic perovskite photovoltaics.

To overcome this critical hurdle, focusing on the grain boundary (GB) of OIHPs, which is the main humidity penetration channel, is crucial. Herein, pressure-induced crystallization of OIHP films prepared with controlled mold geometries is demonstrated as a GB-healing technique to obtain high moisture stability. When exposed to 85% RH at 30 degrees C, OIHP films fabricated by pressure-induced crystallization have enhanced moisture stability due to the enlarged OIHP grain size and low-angle GBs. The crystallographic and optical properties indicate the effect of applying pressure onto OIHP films in terms of moisture stability. The photovoltaic devices with pressure-induced crystallization exhibited dramatically stabilized performance and sustained over 0.95 normalized PCE after 200 h at 40% RH and 30 degrees C.

Despite the high PCEs, there are several unresolved issues on optimal interface states in the cell and device stabilities. Moreover, beyond the simple PV device issues, extended device or circuit applications have rarely been reported although it seems equally important to fully reveal the self-power energy harvesting functions of the perovskite cells to modern ubiquitous environment. Here, we integrate a realistic self-power circuit utilizing a few nm-thin molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2) field effect transistors (FETs) as well as perovskite PV cells. The PV cells intrinsically show more than 0.9 V of open circuit voltage (V-OC) under artificial sun (AM 1.5) or visible photon illumination, so we thus used a red-light emitting diode (LED) to simply generate similar to 1 V of photovoltage. Two modes for practical operation were consequently observed from the circuit, depending on the light intensity: self-power current/voltage source mode (high intensity) and photosensor mode (low intensity). We now conclude that our self-power circuit approaches integrating perovskite cells and 2D MoTe2 FET could attract much attention for future ubiquitous electronics and energy harvest applications.

However, the commonly used organic hole transport materials (HTMs) suffer from heat-, light-, and bias-induced degradation along with defect diffusion and hygroscopic properties. To resolve these issues in conventional HTMs, inorganic materials with superior chemical stability, high carrier mobility, and low cost have been developed, demonstrating improved stability under rigorous conditions such as high temperature and long-term illumination. Understanding the properties of alternative inorganic HTMs is of prominent importance to realize more stable and efficient PSCs. This review summarizes the recent progresses in inorganic HTMs adopted in various device architectures, with their remarkable achievements in efficiency and long-term stability. [GRAPHICS] .

As a universal method, potassium doping into bulk perovskite films to minimize or eliminate the hysteresis was proposed. Here, we report direct observation of moderately retarded ion migration in K+-doped (FAPbI(3))(0.875)(CsPbBr3)(0.125) perovskite by in situ photoluminescence (PL) imaging. However, more impressive is the effect on the kinetics for generation of the ionic double layer in the vicinity of the contacts as it is reduced by two orders of magnitude on the time scale when devices are doped with K+ as detected by impedance spectroscopy. A significantly reduced hysteresis in the K+-doped perovskite is responsible for more prolonged stability exhibiting similar to 96% of initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after 22 days than relatively short-lived perovskites undoped with K+ ions. This work highlights the clear correlation of ion migration and a fast generation of the double layer close to the contacts with severe hysteresis and long-term instability in PSCs and the importance of K+ ions in reducing the kinetics affecting the ionic attachment to the contact surface.

Often, these are considered entirely different branches of research; however, considering them simultaneously and holistically can provide several new opportunities. Recent advancements have highlighted the potential of hybrid perovskites for high-efficiency solar cells. The intrinsic polar properties of these materials, including the potential for ferroelectricity, provide additional possibilities for simultaneously exploiting several energy conversion mechanisms such as the piezoelectric, pyroelectric, and thermoelectric effect and electrical energy storage. The presence of these phenomena can support the performance of perovskite solar cells. The energy conversion using these effects (piezo-, pyro-, and thermoelectric effect) can also be enhanced by a change in the light intensity. Thus, there lies a range of possibilities for tuning the structural, electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of perovskites to simultaneously harvest energy using more than one mechanism to realize an improved efficiency. This requires a basic understanding of concepts, mechanisms, corresponding material properties, and the underlying physics involved with these effects.

Recently, PSCs with efficiency exceeding 22% have been fabricated using Li-doped mesoporous TiO2 as an electron transport layer (ETL). However, the use of Li can negatively influence device stability during the fabrication process under humid air because of its hydroscopic property. Here, we report a strategy for improving processing stability without sacrificing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) under a humid atmospheric environment by employing a mesoporous BaSnO3 as an ETL. Using the mesoporous BSO ETL, we achieved a certified efficiency of 21.3% and stabilized efficiency of 21.7%. Furthermore, the BSO-based PSCs also exhibited better processing stability than Li-doped TiO2-based PSCs under humid air. We believe that this strategy of introducing BSO into PSCs will accelerate the commercialization of PSCs.

However, the addition of Br inevitably leads to a bandgap that is too wide (1.93-2.03 eV) compared to that of CsPbI3 (1.73 eV). To avoid this, the present study focuses on developing stable alpha-CsPbI3-xBrx (x < 0.7) perovskite films with lower Br levels. Our dynamic CsBr treatment incorporates Br- into the CsPbI3 lattice, greatly enhancing the morphology, optical properties, stability, and photovoltaic performance of the resultant CsPbI3-xBrx (x < 0.7) perovskite films. At x = 0.66, the perovskite film with the relatively low bandgap of 1.84 eV contributes to achieving an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.08% and, after 1200 h storage under a nitrogen atmosphere without encapsulation, the PCE remains at around 70% of this initial level. This two-step growth using dynamic CsBr treatment opens up promising routes for the feasible fabrication of inorganic perovskite photovoltaics with exceptional stability.

We obtained the optical conductivity from the measured reflectance spectra of the single crystals at various temperatures using a Kramers-Kronig relation and measured their PL spectra at selected temperatures. We observed structural phase transitions and a mixed-structure phase from the infrared-active phonon modes in the measured optical data. In the mixed phase, we observed unsystematic temperature-dependent bandgap behavior in both optical and PI. spectra. The unsystematic bandgap behavior can be understood by taking into account both the contributions of thermal effect and structural phase to the size of the bandgap in the temperature region of the mixed structural phase or the structural phase transition. Interestingly, we also observed quantitative differences in those optical and PL properties between thin film and single crystal samples. We expect that our results will supply helpful information for further development of hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells.

Effective interface engineering in PSCs is reported via a multifunctional chemical linker of 4-imidazoleacetic acid hydrochloride (ImAcHCl) that can provide a chemical bridge between SnO2 and perovskite through an ester bond with SnO2 via esterification reaction and an electrostatic interaction with perovskite via imidazolium cation in ImAcHCl and iodide anion in perovskite. In addition, the chloride anion in ImAcHCl plays a role in the improvement of crystallinity of perovskite film crystallinity. The introduction of ImAcHCl onto SnO2 realigns the positions of the conduction and valence bands upwards, reduces nonradiative recombination, and improves carrier life time. As a consequence, average power conversion efficiency (PCE) is increased from 18.60% +/- 0.50% to 20.22% +/- 0.34% before and after surface modification, respectively, which mainly results from an enhanced voltage from 1.084 +/- 0.012 V to 1.143 +/- 0.009 V. The best PCE of 21% is achieved by 0.1 mg mL(-1) ImAcHCl treatment, along with negligible hysteresis. Moreover, an unencapsulated device with ImAcHCl-modified SnO2 shows much better thermal and moisture stability than unmodified SnO2.

In general, humidity and heat are the most well-known degradation sources for perovskites, requiring ideal design of perovskite chemistry to withstand them. Although triple-cation perovskite (Cs-0.05(FA(0.85)MA(0.15))(0.95)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)(3)) has been already introduced as the stable perovskite material, the high reactivity of methylammonium and formamidinium in the cation sites demands further modification. Herein, 1,2,4-triazole is suggested as an effective cation solute to improve the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells. 1,2,4-Triazole is an aromatic cation with low dipole moment that is stable under humidity and heat. It also possesses three nitrogen atoms, forming additional hydrogen bonds in the lattice, stabilizing the material. In this study, the solar cell utilizing 1,2,4-triazole alloying achieves a power conversion efficiency of 20.9% with superior stability under extreme condition (85 degrees C/85% of relative humidity (RH), encapsulated) for 700 h. The 1,2,4-triazole-alloyed perovskite exhibits reduced trap density and film roughness and enhanced carrier lifetime with electrical conductivity, suggesting an ideal perovskite structure for efficient and stable optoelectronic applications.

However, the perovskite composition and type of the electron transport layer (ETL) play a key role in improving their performance. Therefore, in the present investigation, high quality TiO2/SnO2 bilayer ETLs and thermally stable reduced methylammonium (MA) cation based triple-cation perovskite layers are used to fabricate thermally stable PSCs. By retaining their normal (n-i-p) device architecture, the influence of antisolvents on the perovskite layer has been investigated in detail. Systematic studies in this work reveal that the amorphous SnO2/TiO2 bilayer and the trifluorotoluene (TFT) processed perovskite layer significantly influence the current density and open circuit voltage (V-OC) and reduce the charge recombination of perovskite devices. The optimised devices having micrometer size grains exhibited >20.5 +/- 0.5% PCE for a thermally stable Rb-0.05(FAPbI(3))(0.95)(MAPbBr(3))(0.05) perovskite composition with a SnO2/TiO2 bilayer ETL. Furthermore, the SnO2:TiO2 bilayer ETL-containing PSCs are thermally stable for more than 200 hours at 80 degrees C.

Such a low-priced SAHF exhibited a superior antireflective ability with an average transmittance of 93.7% in the wavelength range of 350-800 nm. It also possesses a high diffuse transmittance and very high haze transmission values of approximately 84.3% and 89.8%, respectively. Resultantly, laminating the SAHF on the transparent side of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) remarkably enhances the light absorption into their active layer and also improves the light harvesting ability. Thus, the power conversion efficiency of PSC is enhanced from 17.07% to 20.34% by laminating the SAHF on the surface of the cell. In addition, the hydrophobicity and thermal resistance of SAHF is also exploited to stabilize (or maintain) the efficiency of PSCs for a long-term period under dark and solar irradiation conditions.

There have been significant efforts to enhance hot electron flux, and it has been found that a key factor affecting the hot electron flux is the lifetime of the hot electrons. Here, we report a combined study of hot electron flux and the lifetime of hot carriers using a perovskite-modified plasmonic nanodiode. We found that perovskite deposition on a plasmonic nanodiode can considerably improve hot electron generation induced by photon absorption. The perovskite plasmonic nanodiode consists of MAPbI(3) layers covering a plasmonic-Au/TiO2 Schottky junction that is composed of randomly connected Au nanoislands deposited on a TiO2 layer. The measured incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency and the short-circuit photocurrent show a significantly improved solar-to-electrical conversion performance of this nanodiode. Such an improvement is ascribed to the improved hot electron flux in MAPbI(3) caused by effective light absorption from near-field enhancement of plasmonic Au and the efficient capture of hot electrons from Au nanoislands via the formation of a three-dimensional Schottky interface. The relation between the lifetime and flux of hot electrons was confirmed by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy that showed considerably longer hot electron lifetimes in MAPbI(3) combined with the plasmonic Au structure. These findings can provide a fundamental understanding of hot electron generation and transport in perovskite, which can provide helpful guidance to designing efficient hot carrier photovoltaics.

Specifically, high optical transparency and excellent electrical properties are essential for optimized hole transport materials in inverted-type planar perovskite solar cells. In this study, we demonstrate that the molecular doping of copper thiocyanate (CuSCN) by 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) significantly enhances the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells. The incorporation of F4TCNQ into CuSCN leads to successful electron transfer from CuSCN to F4TCNQ, which affords more balanced energy level alignment at the interface of the perovskite layer for hole conduction. Device analyses reveal faster charge transport and less carrier recombination in the F4TCNQ-doped CuSCN-based devices, contributing to not only the improved efficiency but also the hysteresis elimination. At the optimized doping concentration, the doped CuSCN exhibited an similar to 35% increased efficiency as high as 15.01% in the inverted-type planar perovskite solar cells.

The performance of the perovskite solar cells was investigated through measurements of the current-voltage characteristics, impedance analysis, and photocurrent decay. A power conversion efficiency of 15.43% was measured under 1 sun condition; this level of efficiency is 27% higher than that of the device with a Zr-free TiOx layer. Additionally, the incorporation of Zr into the TiOx layer improved the carrier extraction as a result of the oxygen vacancy trap passivation.

The precursor solution is aged at different temperatures of 4, 25 (room temperature), and 65 degrees C. Power conversion efficiency (PCE) is found to depend on the aging condition. Average PCE increases with aging time, where optimal aging time for best the PCE decreases with aging temperature. Average PCE of 17.29% obtained from a 24 h aged solution at 4 degrees C is higher than that of 16.48% from a nonaged fresh solution. At 25 degrees C, a 2-4 h aged solution yields highest PCE of 17.41%. The aging effect is more accelerated at 65 degrees C, where the best PCE of around 17.10% is achieved from the solution aged for 1.5-2 h. It is commonly observed that photocurrent density is substantially influenced by aging time, while voltage is less affected. Fill factor declines with aging time regardless of aging temperature. Iodoplumbate PbI2S4 (S = solvent) formed in the precursor solution increases its concentration, as aging time increases at a given temperature, which is beneficial for improving photovoltaic performance. No aging effect is found for excess MAI or PbI2 due to initially formed sufficient iodoplumbate.

We analyzed the electrical and optical characteristics of indium tin oxide (ITO) films according to the various crystallization conditions and confirmed that the low-temperature crystallized ITO has a rhombohedral structure. The ultrathin ITO films were crystallized at a temperature of 250 degrees C, which is lower than the glass transition temperature of polyimide substrates, and a hybrid transparent electrode with a metal mesh was formed. Our hybrid transparent electrode had a high transmittance of 77.4% and a low sheet resistance of 6.3 U/sq. After 1000 bending cycles at a bending radius of 6 mm, the hybrid transparent electrode maintained a sheet resistance of 6.5 U/sq.

CH3NH3PbI3-xClx films were prepared on Au surfaces by spin casting with various concentrations to control the film thickness. Their morphology was examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM). CH3NH3PbI3-xClx films exhibited a maximum valence band edge of 5.91 eV. The energy levels shifted downward by 0.26 eV with a perovskite coverage of 116.3 nm, indicating that band bending occurs at the interface. The observed energy level shift indicates an interface dipole at the Au/CH3NH3PbI3-xClx junction. These findings contribute to the understanding of how perovskite materials function in electronic devices and aid in the design of new perovskite materials.

Herein, it is demonstrated that the long-term operational stability of mp-TiO2 based PSCs with PCE over 20% is achieved by isolating devices from oxygen and humidity. This achievement attributes to systematic understanding of the critical role of oxygen in the degradation of PSCs. PSCs exhibit fast degradation under controlled oxygen atmosphere and illumination, which is accompanied by iodine migration into the hole transport material (HTM). A diffusion barrier at the HTM/perovskite interface or encapsulation on top of the devices improves the stability against oxygen under light soaking. Notably, a mp-TiO2 based PSC with a solid encapsulation retains 20% efficiency after 1000 h of 1 sun (AM1.5G including UV) illumination in ambient air.

Photoluminescence of both perovskite films exhibits a peak shift to the higher emission energy as well as a slower decay of recombination by the MACl treatment, suggesting the passivation of defects in band tail states. Photovoltaic performance is further correlated with the change of deep electronic traps in the bandgap, which is characterized through capacitance analyses of solar cells. Degradation of MAPbI(3) cells by the MACl treatment is attributed to the additional deep-trap formation, and the improvement of photovoltaic parameters for triple-cation perovskites is correlated with the reduction of deep traps with trap-level shifts toward the band edge. The reactive characters of MAPbI(3) against post-treatment conditions seem to be responsible for the deep-trap formation as evidenced by the microstructural/morphological results, and consequently, the improved resistance to trap the formation of triple-cation perovskites provides viability for further performance enhancement by surface passivation.

This new series of NPEs with different counterions are capable of forming electric dipoles at NPE/metal electrode interfaces; as a consequence tuning of the energy levels, and work function (WF) of the electrodes is possible. Using this approach, the PCE of organic solar cells could be improved from 1.05% (without NPEs) to 6.77% (with NPEs) while the charge carrier mobility and on/off ratio of FET devices could be improved, showing the broad utility of this type of material. This study provides a novel approach towards investigating the influence of ions on interfacial dipoles and electrode WFs in solution-processed semiconducting devices.

Typical PSCs were fabricated with a perovskite absorber layer between the TiO2 electron-transport layer (ETL) and the 2,2 ',7,7 '-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9 '-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) hole-transport layer (HTL). We examined the influence of phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) on the PSC device. PSCs using the PCBM layer as an ETL were investigated, and the absorber layer was coated by dissolving PCBM in a methyl ammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)) precursor solution to examine the changes at the perovskite interface and inside the perovskite absorber layer. The PSCs fabricated by adding a small amount of PCBM to the MAPbI(3) solution exhibited a significantly higher maximum efficiency of 16.55% than conventional PSCs (14.34%). Fabricating the PCBM ETL and PCBM-MAPbI(3) hybrid solid is expected to be an efficient route for improving the photovoltaic performance.

The PSCs were fabricated with a glass/FTO/BL-TiO2/meso-TiO2 + GO/perovskite/HTL/Au electrode structure by adding various contents of GO (0.0, 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7 wt%) to the TiO2 layer. To analyze the photovoltaic characteristics and transmittance of the TiO2 layer of the PSCs according to the GO content, solar simulator and ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared spectroscopy were used, respectively. Atomic force microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscope were used to analyze the microstructures of both the TiO2 layer and the perovskite layer. The results of the photovoltaic characteristics indicated that energy conversion efficiency (ECE) was gradually increased to 12.70%, 13.13%, 14.19%, and 12.63% for 0.0, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 wt% GO contents, respectively. The highest ECE was observed at a GO content of 0.5 wt%, and a decrease in the ECE was confirmed at higher levels. The increase in ECE was confirmed by measuring short circuit current density (J(sc)) and shunt resistance which increased with the GO addition. However, when an excessive amount of GO content was added, a decrease in the ECE was observed, due to the decrease in J(sc) by the reduction in transmittance. In particular, an increase in the perovskite crystal size caused an increase in the ECE, due to the increased rms of TiO2 at 0.5 wt% GO. With the 0.7 wt% GO TiO2 layer, the perovskite grain size was decreased by the reduction in rms, and this resulted in a decrease in J(sc) and ECE. These results suggest that we might improve the efficiency of perovskite solar cells by adding the proper amount of GO to the TiO2 layer.

In PSCs, the hole transport layer (HTL) plays a significant role in achieving high efficiency by improving charge collection and reducing recombination losses at the interface of the HTL/perovskite. Herein, we present a detailed investigation of the photovoltaic performance of PSCs by employing Fe-doped NiOx nanoparticles (NPs) as HTL. A simple solution method is adopted to synthesize Fe-doped NiOx NPs and their corresponding films are deposited by spin coating using Fe-NiOx inks at room temperature without any post treatment. As the obtained Fe-doped NiOx films exhibited an improvement in conductivity and work function, they resulted in an improvement in hole extraction and charge collection, while suppressing the charge recombination. Consequently, Fe-NiOx-based devices provided a significant enhancement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.57% compared to pristine NiOx of 15.41%. Flexible PSCs also showed an improvement in PCE from 13.37% for pristine NiOx to 14.42% for Fe-NiOx NPs. This work demonstrates that Fe-doped NiOx can be a promising HTL for fabricating highly efficient and flexible PSC production in the future.	[Chandrasekhar, P.

These were then used as a hole transport layer in regular (n-i-p) type organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells. Morphology of the NiO QDs was observed with Field emission electron microscope (FESEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) that revealed a monodispersed particles of an average particle size of about 5.5 +/- 0.5 nm with distinct lattice fringes (spacing of 0.24 nm). A solar cell was fabricated on FTO glass by coating compact TiO2, methylammonium lead halide (MAPbI), NiO-QDs and gold electrode (FTO/c-TiO2/MAPbI/NiO/Au). With the fabricated cell, we were able to obtain photo-conversion efficiency of 6.2%, fill factor of 0. 56, J(sc) is 10.77 mA/cm2 and V-oc is 1.02 V, which is a reasonable value for such cells.

To demonstrate air-stable as well as efficient ITO-free semitransparent PeSCs, ultra thin Cu and Ni, which are well-known non-precious metals having sufficient electrical conductivity, are investigated as bottom transparent electrode and optimization of devices is systematically carried out. Semitransparent Ni/NiOx based PeSC exhibits the average visible transmittance (AVT) of 22% and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.20%. Considering required AVT for the application of power-generating window of similar to 25% and recent reports, this result is one of the best performances reported to date.

However, the working mechanism of the Li-TFSI dopant is a long-standing question. The hygroscopicity of Li-TFSI makes it difficult to isolate the exact doping mechanism. In this study, we unveil the role of Li-TFSI in the p-doping to the N,N'-di(1-naphthyl)-N,N'-diphenyl-(1,1'-biphenyl)-4,4'-diamine (NPB) HTL. A series of systematic in situ measurements using ultraviolet and inverse photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that electron transfer from NPB to Li-TFSI occurs due to the lower-lying negative polaronic level of Li-TFSI rather than the positive polaronic level of NPB. The hole injection barrier between NPB and indium tin oxide is significantly reduced with Li-TFSI doping, enhancing the device performance of hole-only devices and organic light-emitting diodes dramatically. With excessive dopants, however, the agglomerative property of Li-TFSI became dominant, decreasing the doping efficiency. These results provide robust guidelines for developing an efficient doping method for a molecular system with high conductivity.

J	Jung, MH				Jung, Mi-Hee			Hydrophobic perovskites based on an alkylamine compound for high efficiency solar cells with improved environmental stability	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							IODIDE PEROVSKITES; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; LEAD; METHYLAMMONIUM; CATIONS; HALIDES; LENGTHS; STATES	Hybrid quasi-two dimensional perovskites (2D) have attracted significant scientific interest, because they have been demonstrated to be excellent light absorbing materials in photovoltaic devices. However, quasi-2D perovskites still perform poorly in high humidity, even though they have exhibited greatly improved stability compared to their three-dimensional (3D) counterparts. This is the biggest obstacle for the practical implementation and commercial viability of perovskite solar cells. Herein, we used hexylamine (CH3(CH2)(4)CH2NH2, HA) for a quasi-2D, HA(CH3NH3)(n-1)PbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) perovskite, which had sufficiently long alkyl chains to maintain the chemical stability of the perovskite. As the number of layers of quasi 2D HA(CH3NH3)(n-1)PbnI3n+1 perovskites was increased, they exhibited an appropriate band gap as a light absorber to be applied in solar cells. The perovskite solar cell based on the 2D HA(CH3NH3)(n-1)PbnI3n+1 perovskites showed an excellent power conversion efficiency of 5.90% with a short circuit current density of 13.61 mA cm(-1), an open circuit voltage of 0.72 V, a fill factor of 60.10%, and stability in ambient air. The long alkyl chain of the hexylamine cation prevented the degradation of the solar cell in the atmosphere with passivation of the perovskite films due to their high hydrophobic properties. This investigation highlights the role of the organic cation in maintaining the quality of the perovskite film and provides a critical solution for the poor stability of perovskites in ambient air.

Herein, we report the fabrication of efficient planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells employing solution-processed NiCo2O4 as the hole transport layer. The spinel NiCo2O4 thin film obtained via a sol-gel process exhibits high optical transparency, well-matched energy bands, smooth film morphology and decent electrical conductivity, much better than NiO, a typical hole transport layer for perovskite solar cells. We herein demonstrated that due to excellent hole extraction, transport, and collection properties of the solution-processed NiCo2O4, the device efficiency of up to 18.16% was achieved for the planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells. More importantly, the devices with NiCo2O4 as the HTL exhibited hysteresis-free behavior regardless of the voltage scan rate, which out-performed NiO-based devices.

AbstractLarge-area polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films with variably sized moth-eye structures were fabricated to improve the efficiency of perovskite solar cells. An approach that incorporated photolithography, bilayer PDMS deposition and replication was used in the fabrication process. By simply attaching the moth-eye PDMS films to the transparent substrates of perovskite solar cells, the optical properties of the devices could be tuned by changing the size of the moth-eye structures. The device with 300-nm moth-eye PDMS films greatly enhanced power conversion efficiency of similar to 21% due to the antireflective effect of the moth-eye structure. Furthermore, beautiful coloration was observed on the 1000-nm moth-eye PDMS films through optical interference caused by the diffraction grating effect. Our results imply that moth-eye PDMS films can greatly enhance the efficiency of perovskite solar cells and building-integrated photovoltaics.

These problems could be tackled via different aspects which includes the synthesis of promising electron transport layers (ETLs) and HTLs, synthesis of mixed perovskites via combination of 3D and stable 2D perovskite, replacement of poor-stable methylammonium (MA) cation with MA free perovskite and capping inorganic materials will be the best choice toward highly efficient air-thermal-stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). This perspective focuses on the current strategies in PSCs for making the stable PSCs via low-cost, easily processed components and shared our views toward commercialization. (c) The Author(s) 2019.

J	Lee, D; Hwang, B; Lee, JS				Lee, Dongwoo; Hwang, Bohee; Lee, Jang-Sik			Impact of Grain Sizes on Programmable Memory Characteristics in Two-Dimensional Organic-Inorganic Hybrid Perovskite Memory	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						2D layered perovskite; resistive switching memory; vapor deposition; ion migration; grain size control	ORGANOMETAL TRIHALIDE PEROVSKITE; SOLAR-CELLS; MECHANISMS; EFFICIENCY; PROSPECTS; LASERS; ANION	Recently, organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) have been used in resistive switching memory applications because of current-voltage hysteresis that originated from ion migration in the perovskite film. As the density of the memory devices continues to increase, the size of the devices approaches that of the individual grains of the polycrystalline films. Thus, the effects of the grain boundary and the grain size will become important to investigate the influence on the switching behaviors. Here, we report the effects of grain sizes on the resistive switching property of (C4H9NH3)(2)PbBr4 (BA(2)PbBr(4)) films. The BA(2)PbBr(4) films were formed by using sequential vapor deposition. First, a lead bromide (PbBr2) film was deposited by thermal evaporation, and then the film was exposed to organic vapor to form BA(2)PbBr(4) films. The grain sizes were controlled by changing the transformation temperatures (T-T = 100, 150, and 200 degrees C). When the TT values were 100, 150, and 200 degrees C, the grain sizes of BA(2)PbBr(4) were similar to 180 nm, similar to 1, and similar to 30 mu m, respectively. In the memory device based on BA(2)PbBr(4), the off current decreased from similar to 10(-4) to similar to 10(-8) A as the grain size increased from similar to 180 nm to similar to 30 mu m. This method to synthesize BA(2)PbBr(4) films provides a simple way to control the grain sizes, and understanding of the effects of grain sizes on memory characteristics will provide an insight to improve the reliability of the OIHP-based memory as the electronic devices are scaled down to the sizes of grains.

A key issue in perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is the fabrication of an optimal charge transport layer (CTL), which has desirable energy levels for efficient charge injection while blocking opposite charges and enabling perovskite layer growth with reduced interfacial defects. Herein, two poly(fluorene-phenylene)-based anionic conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) with different counterions (K+ and tetramethylammonium (TMA(+))) are presented as multifunctional passivating and hole-transporting layers (HTLs). The crystal growth of MHPs grown on different HTLs is investigated through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and density functional theory calculation. The CPE bearing the TMA(+) counterions remarkably improves the growth of perovskites with suppressed interfacial defects, leading to significantly enhanced emission properties and device performance. The luminescent properties are further enhanced via aging and electrical stress application with effective rearrangement of the counterions on the interfacial defects in the perovskites. Finally, efficient formamidinium lead tribromide-based quasi-2D PeLEDs with an external quantum efficiency of 10.2% are fabricated. Using CPEs with varying counterions as a CTL can serve as an effective method for controlling the interfacial defects and improving perovskite-based optoelectronic device properties.

This manufacturing method is employed together with slot die coating to fabricate perovskite solar cells via a roll-to-roll process. The feasibility of the method is demonstrated after initial testing on a rigid substrate using a benchtop slot die coater in air. The fabricated solar cells exhibit power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 14.7%. A nonelectroactive polymer additive is used with the perovskite formulation and found to improve its humidity tolerance significantly. These deposition parameters are also used in the roll-to-roll setup. The perovskite layer and other solution-processed layers are slot die-coated, and the fabricated device shows PCEs up to 11.7%, which is the highest efficiency obtained from a fully roll-to-roll processed perovskite solar cell to date.

The bandgap of the mixed layer increased by 0.1 eV and the efficiency of perovskite solar cell increased by 0.5%. However, it acts as a resistive element and lowers the current. Since ZnGa2O4 emits absorbed ultraviolet rays in blue, a thin film is additionally formed on the glass substrate to convert ultraviolet rays into electric current in a perovskite solar cell.

In addition to existing empirical approaches, such as cyclic bending tests, in this study we report the tensile properties of the perovskite materials themselves. Measuring the tensile properties of free-standing perovskite materials is critical because (1) tensile properties represent the realistic mechanical properties of the film-type perovskite layer in the solar cells including the effects of various defects, and (2) deformation behavior of the perovskite layer at any deformed state of the solar cells can be analyzed using solid mechanics with the tensile properties as input. Critical bending radius of MAPbI(3)-based flexible solar cells is found to be between 0.5 and 1.0 mm by the decrease in power conversion efficiency during cyclic bending deformation. This finding agrees well with the critical bending radius of 0.66 mm determined based on the elastic deformation limit of 1.17% for MAPbI(3) found by in situ tensile testing. Scanning electron microscopy observations and hole-nanoindentation tests suggest that the formation of coarse cracks in the perovskite layers is the primary cause of the decrease in power conversion efficiency observed in flexible perovskite solar cells.

However, tandem cells require the use of textured Si substrates for efficient light harvesting, and conformal deposition of the perovskite absorption layer on textured Si substrates remains challenging. Here, we introduce a process to prepare a conformal methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)) film on the various substrates regardless of their morphologies via the electrodeposition followed by vapor reaction. First, PbO2 films were electrodeposited on the planar indium tin oxide/NiO substrates in aqueous electrolyte, with their thickness and grain size controlled by adjusting the potential and reaction time. XPS and XRD analyses confirmed that the PbO2 film was fully reduced to PbO by annealing under a reducing atmosphere. Finally, the PbO films were converted into conformal MAPbI(3) via MAI vapor reaction for 25 min at 180 degrees C. We also demonstrated that the PbO2 films could be evenly deposited on textured Si/ITO substrates using pulsed electrodeposition and were then converted into conformal MAPbI(3) using the same vapor reaction process. The proposed approach thus provides a novel route for the preparation of high-quality perovskite films on both planar and textured substrates.

Herein, we propose a facile and scalable approach for the size fractionation of GO flakes by manipulating the surface charge of GO with an organic solvent-mediated aqueous solution. Both the experimental and simulation results confirm that the dispersion of GO flakes is notably influenced by the bond strength with solvent, which is attributed by the charge amount of oxygen in solvent molecule. From the understanding of the dispersion mechanism, an optimal solvent for the size fractionation of GO flakes was determined and GO flakes were successfully sorted into various size groups with a narrow distribution. The effect of size fractionation on the material property and related application was confirmed through various analyses. Our results could bring significant advances in producing two-dimensional materials with reliable and reproducible material properties toward practical applications.

However, most hybrid tandem cell research is based on n-type heterojunction Si cells, which occupy only a small fraction of the total solar market. Here, we propose a new method for optimizing the design of low-cost and high-efficiency monolithic tandem cells based on p-type homojunction Si cells by realizing lossless current matching by simultaneously controlling the band gap energy and thickness of the perovskite film. In addition, systematic studies have been conducted to determine the optimal hole transport layer applicable to the tandem cell from the viewpoint of band alignment and process compatibility, in order to reduce the open-circuit voltage loss. Optimized tandem cells, which were fabricated with a 310 nm thick perovskite layer of (FAPbI(3))(0.8)(MAPbBr(3))(0.2) and a hole transport layer of poly(triaryl amine), had a significantly increased efficiency of 21.19% compared to semi-transparent stand-alone perovskite (13.4%) and Si cells (12.8%). Our tandem cell represented the highest efficiency increment among all monolithic perovskite/Si tandem cells as well as the highest efficiency among monolithic perovskite/Si tandem cells based on p-type homojunction Si cells with Al back-surface fields. The design rules suggested in this study could also be applicable to different types of perovskite/Si tandem cells.

However, a fundamental limitation of MHPs is their low exciton binding energy, which results in a low radiative recombination rate and the dependence of PLQY on the excitation intensity. Under the operating conditions of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), the injected current densities are typically lower than the trap density, leading to a low actual PLQY. Moreover, the defects not only initiate the decomposition of MHPs caused by extrinsic factors, but also intrinsically stimulate ion migration across the interface and lead to the corrosion of electrodes due to interaction between those electrodes, even under inert conditions. The passivation of defects has proven to be effective for mitigating the effects of defects in MHPs. Herein, the origins and theoretical calculations of the defect tolerance in MHPs and the impact of defects on both the performance and stability of perovskite LEDs are reviewed. The passivation methods and materials for MHP bulk films and nanocrystals are discussed in detail. Based on the currently reported advances, specific requirements and future research directions for display applications are suggested.

Using a chemical compound as an additive to the precursor solution has recently been established as a promising method to control the morphology of the perovskite film. In this study, we propose a new method to achieve an improved morphology of the methylammonium lead iodide perovskite film by simultaneous addition of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and methoxyammonium salt (MeO) (dual additives). We demonstrated that an appropriate amount of the MeO additive helps the precursors form a stable intermediated PbI2-DMSO adduct during film formation and enlarges the perovskite grains by retarding the kinetics of conversion of the adduct to the perovskite. Furthermore, we experimentally observed that the optical band gaps and crystal structures of perovskite films are reasonably unaffected by the MeO additive because MeO is almost eliminated during annealing. By optimizing the amount of MeO, we achieved improved device performances of the PSCs with a high power conversion efficiency of 19.71% that is similar to 15% higher than that obtained for the control device (17.15%).

Hence, interfacial modifiers between the cathode and the photoactive layer play a significant role in OSCs and PvSCs, as they provide suitable energy-level alignment, leading to desirable charge carrier selectivity and suppressing charge carrier et recombinations at the interfaces. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the energy-level mapping between a transparent electrode and photoactive layers to enhance the electron-transport ability by introducing amine-based interfacial modifiers (ABIMs). Among the ABIMs, polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE) incorporating inverted OSCs shows enhanced power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) from 0.32 to 9.83% due to large interfacial dipole moments, leading to a well-aligned energy level between the cathode and the photoactive layer. Furthermore, we explore the versatility of the PEIE ABIM by employing different photoactive layers with fullerene derivatives, a nonfullerene acceptor, and a perovskite layer. Promisingly, inverted nonfullerene OSCs and planar n-i-p PvSCs with PEIE ABIM show outstanding PCEs of 11.88 and 17.15%, respectively.

Thus, proper modification of the interfaces between perovskite and charge-transport layers is an efficient method to increase the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs. In this work, we explore the effect of a nonionic surfactant, that is, Triton X-100 (TX) additive, in the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hole-transport layer. The electronic structure of TX-modified PEDOT:PSS is investigated with ultraviolet/X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy with various TX concentrations. The surface of the TX-modified PEDOT:PSS layer showed high TX content, and thus the semimetallic properties of PEDOT:PSS were suppressed conspicuously by its insulating nature. With the TX-modified PEDOT:PSS, the PCE of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)) PSCs increased significantly. To elucidate the origin of the improved device performance, the electrical properties and photoluminescence were investigated comprehensively. Consequently, it was found that the TX additive inhibits interface recombination between PEDOT:PSS and MAPbI(3), which is caused by the suppression of semimetallic properties of the PEDOT:PSS surface. Hence, we fabricated flexible PSCs successfully using a graphene electrode and TX-modified PEDOT:PSS.

J	Mali, SS; Patil, JV; Hong, CK				Mali, Sawanta S.; Patil, Jyoti V.; Hong, Chang Kook			A 'Smart-Bottle' humidifier-assisted air-processed CuSCN inorganic hole extraction layer towards highly-efficient, large-area and thermally-stable perovskite solar cells	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							TRANSPORTING MATERIAL; DEPOSITION METHOD; SPRAY DEPOSITION; CONDUCTOR; DEGRADATION; MANAGEMENT; STABILITY; FILMS; CU2O	A long-term thermally stable, inexpensively produced, inorganic-hole extraction layer (i-HEL) is the best choice for the commercialization of air-thermo-stable, low-cost, highly-efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Low-cost, thermally-stable inorganic copper(I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) i-HEL is the best choice. However, it has unique solubility in polar diethyl sulfide solvent and the conventional spin-coating method damages the perovskite layer, hampering large-area fabrication. In the present investigation we have developed a novel, simple smart-bottle-humidifier-assisted (SBHA) method for p-type CuSCN i-HEL deposition towards air-thermally stable low-cost PSCs. The developed method is very simple, ambient-air processed, cheap and could be suitable for large-area deposition. The best efficiency based on CuSCN i-HEL devices exhibited was 18.78% with >95% and >85% thermal stability over 1000 hours, respectively at 65 +/- 1 and 85 +/- 1 degrees C. Interestingly, CuSCN i-HEL-based devices show >2000 hours of air-stability and are much more stable than conventional expensive additive-doped spiro-MeOTAD-based PSCs. We also explored this technique for large-area (similar to 1.04 cm(2)) fabrication and it exhibited 18.34% PCE with >85% thermal stability at 85 +/- 1 degrees C over 1000 hours, revealing that the developed method is also suitable for large-area perovskite fabrication.

J	Yi, M; Jang, W; Wang, DH				Yi, Minji; Jang, Woongsik; Wang, Dong Hwan			Controlled pH of PEDOT:PSS for Reproducible Efficiency in Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells: Independent of Active Area and Humidity	ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING			English	Article						Photovoltaic devices; Controlled pH; Charge transport; Conducting polymers; Stability	HIGH-PERFORMANCE; TRANSPORT LAYER; LOW-COST; CONDUCTIVITY; MORPHOLOGY; IMIDAZOLE; IODIDE; OXIDE	Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) show great promise, but the acidity of the hole transport layer (HTL) often leads to poor perovskite crystallinity, which limits their performance and introduces inconsistency into the measurement of device parameters. In this research, inverted MAPbI(3) perovskite photovoltaics are fabricated using a pH-controlled HTL. The pH of the PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)) HTL is adjusted using imidazole, and devices with acid, neutral, and base pH HTLs are compared. The neutral HTL device exhibits improved nonwettability of the HTL surface, reduced perovskite roughness, and MAPbI(3) passivation, which improve the perovskite crystallinity. The neutral HTL improves the power conversion efficiency from 12.58% to 14.25% with an active area of 11.8 mm(2) by improving the external and internal quantum efficiency and inducing excellent charge generation and extraction. Additionally, enhanced performance is also observed using active areas of 6.9 and 15.0 mm(2). The neutral-HTL-based device exhibits very consistent performance for various active area sizes, as the uniformity of the perovskite crystals minimizes dependence on the photon absorption area. The enhanced stability of the pH-controlled HTL-based PSCs, including preventing degradation by strong acid because of its reduced acidity, allows the device to retain its power conversion efficiency (PCE) value by maintaining its fill factor even at 80% humidity.

SnO2 layer presents advantages of low-temperature processability and high power-conversion efficiency, and understanding the correlations between the SnO2 properties and device performance will provide a key to realize more efficient perovskite solar cells. Herein, uniform electron-transport layer using SnO2 nanoparticles is fabricated, and the effect of annealing on the solar-cell performance is discussed. Solar cells with low-temperature processed SnO2-nanoparticle layer (below 120 degrees C or even at room temperature) exhibit desirable short-circuit current, open-circuit voltage, and fill factor with the highest efficiency of 19.0%. Using atomic force microscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, both great surface uniformity and favorable band alignment of low-temperature processed SnO2 layer have been observed, which are responsible for the device performance. Furthermore, deep electronic-trap states at the SnO2/perovskite interface are investigated via impedance analysis. Compared to the cells processed over 160 degrees C, low-temperature processed cells exhibit trap states shifting toward the bandedge and reduced trap density, verifying that controlling the interfacial trap states holds a dominance on the open-circuit voltage and is a critical requisite to enable efficient perovskite solar cells. These less-defective solar cells fabricated below 120 degrees C show high thermal stability, suggesting further commercial applications.

Conventional solutions for spin-coating on small areas usually contain polar aprotic solvents with high boiling point, which is difficult to adopt for large-area bar coating because of the uncontrollable and slow drying process due to the strong interaction between polar aprotic solvent and Lewis acidic PbI2 or perovskite. Thus, the precursor solution plays a vital role in the success of large-area coating. Here we report a coating solution suitable for large-area perovskite films. The coating solutions prepared via gas-mediated solid-liquid conversion contain preformed perovskite clusters as confirmed by rotational mode of methylammonium cation in the PbI3- framework from Raman spectroscopy. CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI(3)) films formed by D-bar coating within 20 s on the area over 100 cm(2) exhibit tetragonal/cubic superlattice structure with highly preferred orientation in the entire film, which results in average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.01% and best PCE of 17.82%.

Aside from better morphologies, a lower work function of ETLs, and an efficient charge extraction, along with a much lower transport resistance at the interfaces are found for iOSCs using SnO2/Cs2CO3 rather than devices based on the SnO2 only. The iOSC devices with P3HT:PC60BM as an active layer, using SnO2/Cs-2 CO3 (0.5 mg/ml) as dual ETLs, achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.75%, which is > 36% higher than that of only the based SnO2 (2.75%). Moreover, their PCEs remained at similar to 94% of the initial values after storage for 4 weeks in ambient air without any encapsulations, thus demonstrating the excellent long-term device stability. Notably, for the PTB7-Th:PC70BM systems, we also achieved an impressive champion PCE of 7.78% with using SnO2/Cs2CO3 (0.5 mg/ml) as dual ETLs, meanwhile devices based on SnO2 only exhibited a humble PCE of 4.08%. We believe that SnO2/Cs2CO3 dual ETLs concept can also be applied to other optoelectronic devices such as perovskite solar cells or light-emitting diodes, where an ETL is required to ensure high efficiency.

Polythiophenes are a promising class of hole-transport layer (HTL) materials that could satisfy these requirements. However, PSCs fabricated using conventional poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) HTLs show limited efficiencies of < 16% owing to the shallow highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level and poor charge extraction ability of P3HT. Herein, we demonstrate that the fluorinated polythiophene derivative FEH is a suitable replacement for P3HT and a promising HTL material for perovskite solar cells. The FEH was found to have a deeper HOMO and exhibit more efficient charge-extraction ability at the perovskite/HTL interface than P3HT. This is attributed to the electron withdrawing nature of the fluorine atoms in FEH and its ability to form more uniform films on the perovskite layer. Thus, when FEH was employed as the HTL, the corresponding PSC showed an improved efficiency of 18.0% and an enhancement of all device parameters compared with control devices fabricated using P3HT (10.8%) and Spiro-OMeTAD (17.0%) HTLs. Moreover, fluorination on the conjugated backbone of the polymer increases its hydrophobicity, and the resulting hydrophobic surface of the FEH HTL prevents the ingress of water, resulting in an improvement of the long-term stability of the corresponding PSCs under air exposure.

Optical-electrochemical correlation and density functional theory studies reveal that dicyanovinylene acceptor in SGT-421 downshifted the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level (-5.41 eV), which is more proximal to the valence band (-5.43 eV) of the perovskite, whereas N-methyl rhodanine in SGT-420 and 1,3-indanedione (IND) in SGT-422 destabilized the HOMO, leading to an increased interfacial energy-level offset. SGT-421 exhibits superior properties in terms of a sufficiently low-lying HOMO level and favorable energy-level alignment, intrinsic hole mobility, interfacial hole transfer, hydrophobicity, and trap passivation ability over spiro-OMeTAD as a benchmark small-molecule HTM. As envisaged in the design concept, SGT-421-based PrSC not only yields a comparable efficiency of 17.3% to the state-of-art of spiro-OMeTAD (18%), but also demonstrates the enhanced long-term stability compared to the spiro-OMeTAD because of its multifunctional features. More importantly, the synthetic cost of SGT-421 is estimated to be 2.15 times lower than that of spiro-OMeTAD. The proposed design strategy and the study of acceptor-property relationship of HTMs would provide valuable insights into and guidelines for the development of new low-cost and efficient multifunctional HTMs toward the realization of efficient and long-term stable PrSCs.

Their broader absorption, relatively high stability with low fabrication cost compared to conventional single phase ABX(3) perovskites (where A: organic cation; B: divalent metal ion; and X: halide anion) are key properties of mixed-halide mixed-cation perovskites. However, the controlling reaction rate and formation of extremely dense, textured, smooth, and large grains of perovskite layer is a crucial task in order to achieve highly efficient PSCs. Herein, a new simple dual-retarded reaction processing (DRP) method is developed to synthesize a high-quality mixed-cation (FAPbI(3))(0.85)(MAPbBr(3))(0.15) (where MAPbBr(3) stands for methylammonium lead bromide and FAPbI(3) stands for formamidinium lead iodide) perovskite thin film via intermediate phase and incorporation of nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO). The reaction rate is retarded via two steps: first the formation of intermediate phase and second the interaction of the nitrogen groups on N-rGO with hydrogen atoms from formamidinium cations. This DRP process allows for the fabrication of PSCs with maximum conversion efficiency higher than 20.3%.

In usual solution-based methods such as 2-step solution and antisolvent, we observed the relatively weak two main absorption peaks at 0.95 and 1.87 THz. The measured absorption spectrum is analyzed by density-functional theory calculations. The modes at 0.95 and 1.87 THz are assigned to the Pb-I vibrations of the inorganic components in the tetragonal phase. By contrast, the origin of the 1.58 THz absorption is due to the structural deformation of Pb-I bonding at the grain boundary incorporated with a CH3NH2 molecular defect.

The development of scalable deposition processes is crucial to realize R2R production of flexible PSCs. Gravure printing is a promising candidate with the benefit of direct printing of the desired layer with arbitrary shape and size by using the R2R process. Here, flexible PSCs are fabricated by gravure printing. Printing inks and processing parameters are optimized to obtain smooth and uniform films. SnO2 nanoparticles are uniformly printed by reducing surface tension. Perovskite layers are successfully formed by optimizing the printing parameters and subsequent antisolvent bathing. 2,2',7,7'-Tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9'-spirobifluorene is also successfully printed. The all-gravure-printed device exhibits 17.2% champion efficiency, with 15.5% maximum power point tracking efficiency for 1000 s. Gravure-printed flexible PSCs based on a two-step deposition of perovskite layer are also demonstrated. Furthermore, a R2R process based on the gravure printing is demonstrated. The champion efficiency of 9.7% is achieved for partly R2R-processed PSCs based on a two-step fabrication of the perovskite layer.

J	Zhao, X; Chen, J; Park, NG				Zhao, Xing; Chen, Jiangzhao; Park, Nam-Gyu			Importance of Oxygen Partial Pressure in Annealing NiO Film for High Efficiency Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells	SOLAR RRL			English	Article						annealing atmosphere; inverted; NiO; oxygen partial pressure; perovskite solar cell	NICKEL-OXIDE; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; SELECTIVE CONTACTS; LOW-TEMPERATURE; THIN-FILM; LAYER; STABILITY; IMPACT; METAL	The effect of annealing atmosphere and importance of oxygen partial pressure upon annealing NiO film for achieving high efficiency inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is reported. The solution-process NiO films are deposited on an FTO (fluorine-doped tin oxide) substrate and annealed at 400 degrees C under different atmospheres of air, O-2, N-2, and Ar. The devices using air- and O-2-annealed NiO films show better photovoltaic performance than the N-2- and Ar-annealed ones, mostly due to large difference in photocurrent density (J(sc)) of approximate to 20mAcm(-2) for air and O-2 vs approximate to 15mAcm(-2) for N-2 and Ar. Oxygen-excess condition leads to more p-type characteristics along with better electrical and interfacial properties, leading to higher photovoltaic performance. When comparing air and O-2 condition, the air-annealed NiO film shows slightly better power conversion efficiency (PCE) (15.68% for air vs. 14.93% for O-2), being indicative of importance of oxygen partial pressure. By carefully modifying oxygen content, the best photovoltaic performance is achieved from the NiO film annealed at the O-2/(O-2+N-2) ratio of 30%, delivering a PCE of 16.32%.

A two-step annealing process, which changes the temperature and time in the annealing process of the perovskite film, is important to obtain a more efficient solar cell. The perovskite synthesis proceeds rapidly, but a significant amount of lead iodide residue remains. Additional annealing is needed to reduce the lead iodide residue that causes degradation in efficiency. A solar cell with an average efficiency of 14.3% and a maximum efficiency of 14.58% was fabricated when it was annealed at 150 degrees C for 10 min and further annealed at 120 degrees C for 40 min. In addition, when the TiO2 layer was irradiated with UV light at 185 and 254 nm for 20 min, a perovskite solar cell with an average efficiency of 14.8% and a maximum efficiency of 15.04% was obtained.

Effective removal of the Ag nanoparticles embedded in the surface of the ITO electrodes result in a nanoporous structure without changing the ITO's sheet resistance (10.17 Omega/square) and optical transmittance (89.08%) at a 550 nm wavelength. Examinations with a scanning electron microscope, a transmission electron microscope, and two-dimensional porous mapping show that the nanoporous ITO surface has an increased contact area with the electron transport layer, which enhanced the carrier extraction efficiency of the perovskite solar cells. Compare to perovskite solar cells fabricated on typical ITO with a flat surface morphology, the perovskite solar cells fabricated on the nanoporous-surface ITO show a higher fill factor of 81.1% and a power conversion efficiency of 20.1%. These results indicate that modified ITO surfaces with nano-scale porosity provide a simple and efficient method to improve the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells without a complicated process.

Satisfying the fundamental electrical and optical properties as HTMs of p-i-n planar PSCs, their energy levels can be further tuned by the number of methoxy units for better alignment with those of perovskite, leading to efficient hole extraction. Moreover, when they are introduced between perovskite photoabsorber and low-temperature solution-processed NiOx interlayer, widely featured as an inorganic HTM but known to be vulnerable to interfacial defect generation and poor contact formation with perovskite, nitrogen and oxygen atoms in those organic molecules are found to work as Lewis bases that can passivate undercoordinated ion-induced defects in the perovskite and NiOx layers inducing carrier recombination, and the improved interfaces are also beneficial to enhance the crystallinity of perovskite. The formation of Lewis adducts is directly observed by IR, Raman, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and improved charge extraction and reduced recombination kinetics are confirmed by time-resolved photoluminescence and transient photovoltage experiments. Moreover, UV-blocking ability of the organic HTMs, the ameliorated interfacial property, and the improved crystallinity of perovskite significantly enhance the stability of PSCs under constant UV illumination in air without encapsulation.

Herein, we synthesized MAPbI(3)(Cl) perovskite films by using excess MACl-containing precursors, which exhibited approximately an order of magnitude larger grain size with higher <110>-preferred orientation compared with that from stoichiometric precursors. Comprehensive mechanisms for the large grain evolution by Cl incorporation were elucidated in detail by correlating the changes in grain orientation, distribution of grain size, and the remaining Cl in the perovskite during thermal annealing. In the presence of Cl, <110>-and <001>-oriented grains grew faster than other grains at the initial stage of annealing. Further annealing led to the dissipation of Cl, resulting in the shrinkage of <001> grains while <110> grains continuously grew, as analyzed by x-ray rocking curve and diffraction. As a result of reduced grain boundaries and enhanced <110> texture, the trap density of perovskite solar cells diminished by similar to 10% by incorporating MACl in the precursor, resulting in a fill factor more than 80%.

Here, we report a simple and effective method for crystal growth and defect passivation via additive engineering. It is found that bidentate ligand 2,2-bipyridine (Bpy) and tridentate ligand 2,2:6,2-terpyridine (Tpy) show a positive effect on the power conversion efficiency (PCE) while a negative effect is observed for monodentate pyridine (Py). Bpy or Tpy additives increase the grain size and carrier lifetimes, which indicates that the degree of interaction between Lewis acid species in the precursor solution and pyridine derivatives plays a critical role in modulating grain growth and passivating defects. Moreover, device stability is improved upon introduction of Bpy or Tpy additives, which is mainly ascribed to suppressed trap-assisted non-radiative recombination as a consequence of reduced defect density. This work highlights the importance of rational engineering of additives for the purpose of simultaneous realization of morphological improvement and defect passivation in efficient and stable PSCs.

Charge transport layers play a significant role in improving the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, we investigated the p-type doping effect of the poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) layer on the performance of PSCs by using three dopants. We observe that doping copper(I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) into PTAA led to a higher performance improvement for the PSCs than the use of copper(I) iodide (CuI) or lithium salt (Li-TFSI) as the dopant. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSCs significantly improved from 14.22% to 18.16% upon doping 2.0 wt % CuSCN with simultaneously enhanced open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current density, and fill factor. The long-term stability of the PSCs was also improved with significantly reduced PCE degradation (from 79% to 25%) after 200 h. Our results provide a simple method to improve the performance of planar PSCs by adding dopants into PTAA.

Although the most efficient DSSCs and PSCs have been fabricated using TiO2 as the ETL, TiO2 exhibits inherently low electron mobility with difficulty controlling the energy levels (i.e., conduction and valence bands) as it possesses a single phase of two components. Here, we report the synthesis of Sr-substituted BaSnO3 (BSSO) by a low-temperature solution process as a new alternative to TiO2 for both PSCs and DSSCs. The energy-level tailoring by Sr incorporation into BaSnO3 minimizes the open-circuit voltage (V-OC) loss at the interfaces of ETL/perovskite and ETL/electrolyte in the PSCs and DSSCs, thereby leading to an improved V-OC from 0.65 to 0.72 V in DSSC and 1.07 to 1.13 V in PSCs. Additionally, the BSSO ETL-based PSC shows improved photostability compared to the TiO2 analog. Our results show that energy-level tuned BSSO can be applied as a universal ETL for improving efficiency in both PSCs and DSSCs.

One of the various approaches to increase the efficiency of PSCs is to change the material or structure of the carrier transport layer. Here, optically long and electrically short structural concept is proposed to enhance the characteristics of a PSC by employing selectively grown single crystalline TiO2 nanorods. The approach has the merit of increasing the electron-hole separation effectively and enables a thicker active layer to be coated without electrical loss by using TiO2 nanorods as an electron pathway. Moreover, selectively grown TiO2 nanorods increase the optical path of the incident light via scattering effects and enable a smooth coating of the active layer. Nanoimprint lithography and hydrothermal growth were employed to fabricate selectively grown TiO2 nanorod substrates. The fabricated solar cell exhibits an efficiency of 19.86% with a current density, open-circuit voltage, and fill factor of 23.13 mA/cm(2), 1.120 V, and 76.69%, respectively. Time-resolved photoluminescence, ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, and the incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) analysis were conducted to understand the factors responsible for the improvement in characteristics of the fabricated PSCs.

Apart from the impressive photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications, the applications for OMHPs have recently diverged towards mechanical energy harvesting applications owing to high levels of dielectric and piezoelectric properties that are relatively analogous to those of inorganic piezoelectric materials. Despite these assets, a fundamental understanding of physical behaviors such as ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties remains a key challenge that hampers the development of OMHP-based piezoelectric energy harvesters. This review updates the progress in nanogenerators for mechanical energy harvesting based on OMHPs and includes materials classifications and structural properties, as well as an overview of dielectric, ferroelectric, and piezoelectric properties based on the available literature. In addition, the numerous methods used to synthesize high-quality perovskite films and crystals are also addressed. In the overview of piezoelectric generators (PEGs), various approaches to PEGs based on OMHPs and flexible polymer composites are introduced. For flexible PEGs, fabrication, structural design, factors determining output, and applications are reviewed. Finally, some essential experimental features, perspectives, and issues in this exciting field are discussed and suggested.	[Jella, Venkatraju; Ippili, Swathi; Eom, Ji-Ho; Pammi, S. V.

The phase transition of MASnI3 from tetragonal to cubic is first observed at similar to 30 degrees C. Polycrystalline MASnI(3) films reveal a high dielectric constant of similar to 65 at 100 kHz, a low-leakage current density of 7x10(-7) A cm(-2) at 50 kV cm(-1), well-developed P-E hysteresis loops, and a high piezoelectric coefficient (d(33)) of 20.8 pm V-1. The MASnI(3) piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG) shows an output voltage of similar to 3.8 V and an output current density of 0.35 mu A cm(-2). To enhance the piezoelectric output performance, the MASnI(3) films are composited with an environmentally friendly PVDF polymer that had a porous structure. The PVDF-MASnI(3) composite based-PENG reveals a maximum output voltage of similar to 12.0 V and current density of similar to 4.0 mu A cm(-2). A green light-emitting diode (LED) using the PVDF-MASnI(3) PENGs is instantly lighted without need of a storage device, and long-term stability of the composite PENGs is validated for 90 days.

This is because direct contact between the FTO glass substrate and the perovskite layer should be blocked to suppress electron recombination and to collect electrons. In the present study, PSCs were fabricated using sputtered TiO2 compact layers prepared at different deposition times. The structure, morphology, and electrical properties of the sputter deposited TiO2 compact layer were compared to those of a spin coated TiO2 film. The TiO2 compact layer prepared by the sputtering process was very smooth and inhibited electron recombination at the FTO interface, resulting in a higher open circuit voltage and a higher short circuit current density. A photoelectric conversion efficiency of 13.37% was obtained using the TiO2 compact layer deposited for 30 min.

The YAG:Ce3+ nanophosphor acts as a light down-converting material to absorb high energy photons and emit lower energy photons that match well with the absorption of the perovskite layer, yielding more excited photo-generated electron-hole pairs. Therefore, the incident solar light can be harvested more effectively. We used 8 mg/ml of TiO2 mixed with YAG: Ce3+ in the PSCs and realized a light-to-electric energy conversion efficiency of 13.34%, a short circuit current density of 21.23 mA/cm(2), an open circuit voltage of 0.97 V, and a FF of 55.96%. Higher efficiencies were achieved for PSCs with phosphor-mixed TiO2 than for cells with pure TiO2 nanoparticles. The samples were characterized by XRD, SEM, UV-vis, PL, and IV-curves. Photoelectrode DSSC with light-to-electric energy conversion efficiency was achieved under a simulated solar light irradiation of 100 mW/cm(2) (AM 1.5).

These unique semiconducting materials as absorbers demonstrate a remarkably improved power conversion efficiency of over 20% and now with a certified efficiency of 23.3%. Considering the Shockley-Queisser limit and their bandgaps, there is still much room to increase the efficiency. Stable devices with reproducibility and long-term use are essential for their commercialization. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a powerful technique to deposit high-quality thin films with excellent thickness accuracy and conformality, as well as with no pin-holes in a large area at low temperatures. ALD could be an ideal tool for efficient and stable perovskite solar cells. In particular, ALD will emerge for the production of tandem as well as flexible solar cells. This review contains the following recent research topics; underlying charge transport layers onto transparent conducting oxides (TCO), interfacial layers, overlying electron transport layers (ETLs), and encapsulation techniques utilized by ALD. Several extended understandings by recent studies and challenges toward further enhancing the efficiency and stability will be addressed.

Namely, MAPbI(3), (FA(0.83)MA(0.17))Pb(I0.83Br0.17)(3), and (Cs(0.10)FA(0.75)MA(0.15))Pb(I0.85Br0.15)(3) perovskites (abbreviated as MA, FAMA, and CsFAMA, respectively) are examined with a grain growth control through thermal annealing. FAMA- and CsFAMA-based cells result in stable photovoltaic performance, while MA cells are sensitively dependent on the perovskite grain size dominated by annealing time. Micro-/nanoscopic features are comprehensively analyzed to unravel the origin that is directly correlated to the cell performance with the applications of electronic-trap characterizations such as photoconductive noise microscopy and capacitance analyses. It is revealed that CsFAMA has a lower trap density compared to MA and FAMA through the analyses of 1/f noises and trapping/detrapping capacitances. Also, an open-circuit voltage (V-oc) change is correlated to the variation of trap states during the shelf-life test: FAMA and CsFAMA cells with the negligible change of V-oc over weeks exhibit trap states shifting toward the band edge, although the power-conversion efficiencies are clearly reduced. The origins that critically affect the solar cell performance through the characterizations of shallow/deep traps with additional mobile defects in the perovskite and interfaces are discussed.

First, the energy release rate of the mold film is controlled successfully for an efficient transfer process, which was confirmed by contact angle measurements compared to the normal PUA. The transfer-printed PEDOT:PSS layer exhibits comparable smoothness, and also induces the favorable crystallinity of perovskite related to the spin-coated layer, which shows similar J(sc) and PCE (spin-coated compared to transfer printing: 12.85% compared to 12.33%), and improved V-oc. The effects of the device electrical parameters are analyzed in detail by PL mapping, charge carrier mobility, and impedance response. Furthermore, the stability of the device with transfer-printed PEDOT:PSS achieved 90% retention for approximately 40 days, which was affected by the preserved crystallinity of perovskite, and the inhibition of the degradation of ITO from XRD and XPS analyses, respectively. Consequently, the transfer-printed hole extraction layer through the interface control between PUA and PEDOT:PSS using the improved hydrophobicity contributes to maintaining the surface morphologies and device electrical properties; this correlates with the stable operation of perovskite photovoltaics.

Although such additive engineering yields high-quality films, the inherent insulating property of the chemical additives prevents the efficient transport and extraction of charge carriers, thereby limiting the applicability of this approach. Here, it is shown that organic conjugated molecules having rhodanine moieties (i.e., SA-1 and SA-2) can be used as semiconducting chemical additives that simultaneously yield large-sized perovskite grains and improve the charge extraction. Using this strategy, a high power conversion efficiency of 20.3% as well as significantly improved long-term stability under humid air conditions is achieved. It is believed that this approach can provide a new pathway to designing chemical additives for further improving the efficiency and stability of PeSCs.

The insertion of the CdSe TP layer between the titanium oxide (TiO2) and perovskite film facilitates electron transfer at the TiO2/perovskite interface, as indicated by the significantly quenched steady-state photoluminescence of the perovskite film. Furthermore, we observed a conductivity enhancement of the perovskite film by introducing the CdSe TP layer. The combination of both effects induced by the TPs leads to enhancement in the carrier extraction as well as decreased recombination losses in the perovskite solar cells. As a result, an efficiency of 13.5% (1 sun condition) is achieved in the perovskite solar cells that incorporate the CdSe TP layer, which is 10% higher than that of the device without the CdSe TP layer.

In recent years, there has been huge interest in designing innovative TCEs to replace the conventional indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes, which suffer from complex fabrication issues and are incompatible with flexible, wearable electronic devices. In this regard, TCEs based on metal meshes are considered to be the best candidates because of their inherently high electrical conductivity, optical transparency, mechanical robustness and, more importantly, cost-competitiveness. In this review, we describe the technology developments of metal mesh-based transparent conductors and their applications in organic optoelectronic devices, including organic and perovskite solar cells, organic light emitting diodes, supercapacitors, electrochromic devices etc. Specifically, we discuss the fundamental features, optoelectronic properties, fabrication techniques and device applications of metal mesh TCEs. We also highlight the important criteria for evaluating the performance of metal mesh electrodes and propose some new research directions in this emerging field.

J	Hong, J; Kim, H; Hwang, I				Hong, Jungyun; Kim, Hyebin; Hwang, Inchan			Aging-induced light-soaking effects and open-circuit voltage hysteretic behavior of inverted perovskite solar cells incorporating a hole transport metal halide layer via morphology-dependent inflow of iodide ions	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							PROCESSED COPPER IODIDE; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; EFFICIENT; MIGRATION; CONDUCTOR; RECOMBINATION; ORIGIN; IMPACT; TIO2	Light soaking and current density-voltage (J-V) hysteretic effects represent instability in the power output of organic-inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells that exhibit promising potential in applications in the field of energy conversion. Ion migration/ accumulation is known to be a key factor causing those effects, but the mechanisms to determine which accumulation region makes a more significant contribution need to be further elucidated. Copper iodide (CuI) has been diversely utilized as a hole-transport layer in solutionprocessed photovoltaic devices. In this work, for the first time, the power output instability that occurs seemingly at random with an incorporation of CuI in methylammonium lead triiodide perovskite solar cells is found to be, in fact, strongly aging-and CuI morphology-dependent. Light-soaking effects and hysteretic behavior particularly in the open-circuit voltage (V-oc) appear differently for the fresh and aged devices. Device investigations with the aging time scale, electrical preconditioning, light intensity-dependent V-oc, and scan rates demonstrate that the accumulation of iodide ions at the interface with an electron transport layer (PCBM) by the diffusive migration from the interface with CuI during aging is responsible for light soaking and hysteresis phenomena. Our study reveals which ion accumulation region may more significantly contribute to light soaking and hysteretic phenomena.

Sheet resistance, optical transmittance, surface morphology, and microstructure of the ITO films on SiO2/invar substrate are investigated as a function of the thickness from 50 to 200 nm. The optimized ITO film exhibits a low sheet resistance of 50.21 Ohm/square and high optical transmittance of up to 94.31% even though it is prepared at room temperature. In particular, high reflectance of invar metal substrate could enhance the power conversion efficiency of curved perovskite solar cell fabricated on the ITO/SiO2/invar substrate. In addition, critical bending radius of the 150 nm-thick ITO film is determined by lab-designed outer and inner bending tests to show feasibility as flexible electrode. Furthermore, dynamic fatigue test is carried out to show flexibility of the ITO film on invar metal substrate. This suggests that the ITO/SiO2/invar substrate can be applied as flexible electrodes and substrates for curved perovskite solar cells.

Exploring wide bandgap metal oxides for perovskite solar cells	APL MATERIALS			English	Article							ELECTRON-TRANSPORT LAYERS; NB-DOPED TIO2; DIFFUSION LENGTHS; HIGHLY EFFICIENT; THIN-FILMS; PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; CARBON-MONOXIDE; CH3NH3PBI3; STABILITY	The heterojunction formed when wide bandgap oxides come into contact with perovskite solar cells is essential for high efficiency as it minimizes charge leakage along with charge separation and charge transfer. Therefore, the electrical and optical properties of wide bandgap oxides, including the bandgap, charge mobility, and energy level, directly determine the efficiency of perovskite solar cells. In addition, the surface properties of the wide bandgap oxide act as an important factor that determines the efficiency through the wettability and penetration of the precursor solution during perovskite layer deposition and long-term stability through the intimate interfacial bonding with the perovskite. Although a great variety of wide bandgap oxides are known, the number that can be used for perovskite solar cells is considerably reduced in view of the limitations that the light absorber (here, perovskite) for solar cells is fixed, and the oxides must be uniformly coated at low temperature onto the substrate. Herein, a review of the results from several broad bandgap oxides used in perovskite solar cells is presented, and a direction for discovering new photoelectrodes is proposed. (C) 2018 Author(s).

Moreover, integrating 2D OIPs with the 2D materials including graphene, transition metal dichalcogenide, and other OIPs gives opportunities for various options in constructing new types of heterojunctions with novel functionalities such as enhanced charge transport properties or chemical stability. Here, a sequential vapor deposition method is presented to fabricate 2D OIP lateral heterostructure films (C4H9NH3)(2)PbI4 (BA(2)PbI(4))-(C4H9NH3)(2)(CH3NH3)Pb2I7 (BA(2)MAPb(2)I(7)) for photodetector applications. The lateral heterostructure is realized using thermal evaporation to deposit lead iodide (PbI2) films, then exploiting vapor transport of organic vapor to form BA(2)PbI(4), BA(2)MAPb(2)I(7), and self-aligned lateral heterostructure. A photodetector based on the lateral structure (BA(2)PbI(4)-BA(2)MAPb(2)I(7)) shows larger photocurrent and higher on/off ratio (>10(2)) than those of single material-based devices (BA(2)PbI(4), BA(2)MAPb(2)I(7)). This method to fabricate 2D OIP lateral heterostructure suggests a simple way to synthesize 2D perovskite heterostructure and may open the possibility of 2D OIP perovskites to be integrated in emerging optoelectronic devices.

Inspired by light-assisted dopamine-facilitated synaptic activity, which achieves rapid learning and adaptation by lowering the threshold of the synaptic plasticity, a two-terminal organolead halide perovskite (OHP)-based photonic synapse is fabricated and designed in which the synaptic plasticity is modified by both electrical pulses and light illumination. Owing to the accelerated migration of the iodine vacancy inherently existing in the coated OHP film under light illumination, the OHP synaptic device exhibits light-tunable synaptic functionalities with very low programming inputs (approximate to 0.1 V). It is also demonstrated that the threshold of the long-term potentiation decreases and synaptic weight further modulates when light illuminates the device, which is phenomenologically analogous to the dopamine-assisted synaptic process. Notably, under light exposure, the OHP synaptic device achieves rapid pattern recognition with approximate to 81.8% accuracy after only 2000 learning phases (60 000 learning phases = one epoch) with a low-power consumption (4.82 nW/the initial update for potentiation), which is approximate to 2.6 x 10(3) times lower than when the synaptic weights are updated by only high electrical pulses.

Despite nickel oxide is a promising hole transport material in perovskite solar cells, electrical conductivity and surface properties of pristine nickel oxide are not satisfactory for achieving high efficiency perovskite solar cells. Here, we demonstrate that cobalt doping significantly improves not only the electrical conductivity but also the interfaces of nickel oxide hole transport layer. As a result, the hole extraction, transport and collection properties are significantly improved in the device using cobalt-doped nickel oxide as a hole transport layer. Also, it reveals that cobalt-doped nickel oxide reduces the trap-sites of interfaces of perovskite/hole transport layer, leading to suppressed charge recombination in the devices. As a result, the devices using cobalt-doped nickel oxide achieve as high as 17.52% without severe hysteresis, which is attributed to better band alignment, superior hole extraction and decreased resistance, as compared to pristine nickel oxide-based devices.

However, this remains a challenge for electron transport layers that exhibit excellent optical/electrical properties while being a thin film of simple morphology. Here we demonstrate the PSC of a 2D photonic crystal nanodisk (ND) array ETL that is compact, but greatly enhances light harvesting. The ND array is fabricated by nanosphere lithography using a monolayer of self-assembled polymer spheres as a physical mask. We fabricate ND arrays of various lattice constants simply by controlling the size of the polymer spheres. Optimal ND arrays exhibit strong forward scattering and optical confinement effects, greatly improving light harvesting in the perovskite layer. We also observe that the ND array improves charge transport by reducing contact resistance with the perovskite layer. ND array ETL PSCs reach 19% maximum power conversion efficiency, with low photocurrent-voltage hysteresis and stable photocurrent output.

It was estimated that using focused E-beam make possible to etch the perovskite film. Etching took place due to formation of lead-organic volatile compounds. The etching process was strongly depended on grazing angle of incident beam. It was estimated that etching effectively take place when grazing angle was close to 45 degrees C. Next key factor was an accelerating voltage. Structure changes take place when E-beam accelerating voltage exceeds 1 kV. Change of structure was tracked by X-ray diffractometry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. The surface evaluation was monitored by atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy methods. Bulk composition was estimated by energy dispersive spectrometer.

J	Kim, HS; Hagfeldt, A; Park, NG				Kim, Hui-Seon; Hagfeldt, Anders; Park, Nam-Gyu			Morphological and compositional progress in halide perovskite solar cells	CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS			English	Review							P-I-N; 2-STEP DEPOSITION; HIGHLY EFFICIENT; BASE ADDUCT; LARGE-AREA; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; TRANSPORT; CATIONS; LAYERS	Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) reached a certified 23.7% efficiency in 2018 by boosting their surprisingly high open-circuit voltage (V-OC) and photocurrent. The suppressed recombination in PSCs significantly cut down the voltage loss between the bandgap energy and V-OC, which encouraged the V-OC to reach closer to the bandgap. In addition, the photocurrent is considerably closer to the theoretical value at a given bandgap, leaving almost no room for further improvement. This remarkable development in the performance of PSCs is mainly ascribed to high-quality perovskite material being consistently tailored in the progress of technology. At the beginning of the progress, the morphology of the perovskite was a major target for improvement to enhance the crystal quality. The need for compositional engineering of the perovskite was raised in later stages of the progress by considering the benefits from different compositions of perovskites and their structural stability. Here we review the overall progress in perovskite materials from two perspectives: morphological progress and compositional progress.

This study aims to demonstrate ultralight and flexible perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with orthogonal silver nanowire (AgNW) transparent electrodes fabricated on 1.3 mu m-thick polyethylene naphthalate foils. The smooth surface morphologies of the orthogonal AgNW transparent electrodes help prevent nonconducting silver halide formation generated by chemical reaction between the AgNWs and iodine in the active layer. The resultant PSCs with orthogonal AgNW transparent electrodes exhibit substantially improved device performance, achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.18%, over PSCs with random AgNW network electrodes (10.43% PCE). Moreover, ultralight and flexible PSCs with the orthogonal AgNW electrodes exhibit an excellent power-per-weight of 29.4 W g(-1), which is the highest value reported for a lightweight solar cell device. These lightweight energy harvesting platforms can be further expanded for various wearable optoelectronic devices.

J	Yeo, JS; Seo, YH; Jung, CH; Na, SI				Yeo, Jun-Seok; Seo, You-Hyun; Jung, Chan-Hee; Na, Seok-In			Structural design considerations of solution-processable graphenes as interfacial materials via a controllable synthesis method for the achievement of highly efficient, stable, and printable planar perovskite solar cells	NANOSCALE			English	Article							HOLE-EXTRACTION; WORK-FUNCTION; OXIDE; POLYMER; HYBRID; CRYSTALLIZATION; PERFORMANCE; ELECTRODES; CONTACT; CRYSTAL	Solution-processable graphenes (represented by reduced graphene oxides, rGOs) have shown promising abilities as HTLs in perovskite solar cells (PeSCs). However, there has been no attempt to systematically tailor the characteristics of rGOs to the specifications of PeSCs. Furthermore, the applications of rGO HTLs have been limited to the spin-coating system, which is incompatible with roll-to-roll manufacturing. Here, with the aid of a polymer-graphene hybrid structure and a controllable synthesis method, we successfully developed a much more feasible rGO HTL and demonstrated highly efficient, stable, and printable p-i-n planar PeSCs with facile one-step processing. The characteristics of the developed polyacrylonitrile- grafted rGOs (PRGOs) were optimized by varying the synthesis conditions including the.-radiation intensity (200, 400, and 600 kGy) and the concentration of the acrylonitrile (AN) precursor (2, 4, and 6 wt%). It is revealed that the PRGO synthesized with a lower AN concentration and a higher irradiation intensity (PRGO_2-600) is the most suitable one for PeSC HTL. PRGO_2-600 effectively raises the average power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PeSCs by similar to 36% compared to those of conventional PeSCs using PEDOT: PSS HTL. The comprehensive investigations confirm that the enhanced device efficiency stems from (1) the favorable interlayer characteristics of the PRGO itself and (2) the well-crystallized perovskite layer grown on the PRGO. In addition to the PCE, thechemically inert PRGOs can also maintain their electrical properties over time and retard the decomposition of perovskite films, thereby prolonging the operation time of PeSCs in the atmosphere. More importantly, the applicability of the PRGO HTL is clearly verified even in the roll-to-roll compatible slot-die coating system, exhibiting comparable performances to those of the spin-coating system.

Tin(IV) oxide is one of the most well-known electron transport materials for perovskite solar cells. Despite tin(IV) oxide serves low hysteresis, low defect concentration and low fabrication temperature of perovskite solar cells, low conduction band edge of tin(IV) oxide limits built-in potential of the solar cell device. Here, we design an organic-inorganic double electron transporting layer by coating a 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)- dithieno[2,3-d: 2',3'-d']-s-indaceno[1,2-b: 5,6-b'] dithiophene on tin(IV) oxide to improve the electron transporting properties perovskite solar cells.

However, the charge transfer kinetics mediated by its surface state remains unclear. Here, the charge transfer mechanism of Cs2SnI6 is reported and the role of its surface state in the presence of a redox mediator is clarified. Specifically, charge transfer through the surface state of Cs2SnI6 and its subsequent surface state charging are demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry and Mott-Schottky measurements, respectively. Because it is expected that the surface state of Cs2SnI6 is capable of regenerating oxidized organic dyes, a Cs2SnI6-based regenerator is developed for a dye-sensitized solar cell composed of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/dyed mesoporous TiO2/regenerator/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/FTO. As expected, the performance of the Cs2SnI6-based regenerator is strongly dependent on the highest occupied molecular orbital of the dyes. Consequently, Cs2SnI6 shows efficient charge transfer with a thermodynamically favorable charge acceptor level, achieving a 79% enhancement in the photocurrent density (14.1 mA cm(-2)) compared with that of a conventional liquid electrolyte (7.9 mA cm(-2)). The results suggest that the surface state of Cs2SnI6 is the main charge transfer pathway in the presence of a redox mediator and should be considered in future designs of Cs2SnI6-based devices.

To overcome these limitations, modification of the perovskite material should be addressed. Herein, imidazole (C3H4N2) is demonstrated as an A-site solute for the conventional methyl-ammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3). As an aromatic hydrocarbon and diamine species with a small ionic radius, imidazole is appropriately alloyed and the bond interactions within the ABX(3) lattice are increased. Also, the nature of delocalized pi bonding and the unique structure of imidazole allow the formation of an unprecedented kind of hybrid perovskite exhibiting favorable band alignment and optical propertie with high electrical conductivity. Optimal content of imidazole incorporated into CH3NH3PbI3 with architectural optimization of the device leads to improved PCEs approaching 20.2% (reverse) with small hysteresis (forward PCE = 19.0%). Furthermore, properly alloyed imidazole into the A-site of CH3NH3PbI3 leads to extra stability against air, light, and heat. Lastly, devices with a large active area of 2 cm(2) exhibit PCEs as high as 16.8%, further addressing the effect of imidazole on the formation of high quality nanostructured perovskite and devices.

Thermally activated, light-induced electron-spin-resonance spin density reflected by photocurrents in a perovskite solar cell	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							TEMPERATURE; EFFICIENCY; INTERFACE; STATE; GAP	Light-induced electron-spin-resonance (LESR) spin density in a perovskite solar cell (PSC) is ascribed to photo-induced charges accumulated at the interface of the perovskite and the hole transport layer (HTL). The LESR spin density was observed to he decreased as the temperature was lowered from room temperature to 170 K in a PSC; below similar to 170 K, no LESR was found. Meanwhile, the photocurrent showed only an similar to 25% decrease between room temperature and 170 K. The comparison of LESR in temperature-dependence with transient or steady photocurrents suggested that the decrease in photocurrent at the low temperatures stems mainly from trapping of delocalized holes at the interface of perovskite and HTL.

Among the various factors to be considered for high power conversion efficiency (PCE) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), increasing the grain size of perovskite is most important. However, it is difficult to obtain a highly crystalline perovskite film with large grain size by using the conventional hot-plate annealing method because heat is transferred unidirectionally from the bottom to the top. In this work, we presented radiative thermal annealing (RTA) to improve the structural and electrical properties of perovskite films. Owing to the omnidirectional heat transfer, swift and uniform nuclei formation was possible within the perovskite film. An average grain size of 500 nm was obtained, which is 5 times larger than that of the perovskite film annealed on a hot-plate. This perovskite film led to an enhancement of photovoltaic performance of PSCs. Both short-circuit current density and PCE of the PSCs prepared by RTA were improved by 10%, compared to those of PSCs prepared by hot-plate annealing.

However, the full realization of highly efficient, flexible PSCs is largely prevented by technical difficulties in simultaneously attaining a transparent electrode with efficient charge transport to meet the specifications of PSCs. In this study, an effective strategy for resolving this technical issue has been devised by proposing a simple but highly effective technique to fabricate an efficient, multilayer TiO2/Ag-(O)/ZnO (TAOZ) configuration. This configuration displays low losses in optical transmittance and electrical conductivity owing to its completely continuous, ultrathin metallic Ag-(O) transparent electrode, and any notable current leakage is suppressed by its pinhole-free TiO2 electron transport layer. These features are a direct consequence of the rapid evolution of Ag-(O) and TiO2 into ultrathin, completely continuous, pinhole-free layers owing to the dramatically improved wetting of metallic Ag-(O) with a minimal dose of oxygen (ca. 3 at%) during sputtering. The TAOZ configuration exhibits an average transmittance of 88.5% in the spectral range of 400-800 nm and a sheet resistance of 8.4 sq(-1) while demonstrating superior mechanical flexibility to that of the conventional TiO2 on ITO configuration. The photocurrent conversion efficiency of flexible PSCs is significantly improved by up to 11.2% thanks to an optimum combination of optoelectrical performance and pinhole-free morphologies in the TAOZ configuration.

This method also allows for printing (patterning) of the perovskite on a desired area. The pre-annealed MAPbI(3) and -phase FAPbI(3) films were prepared by spin-coating DMSO and a polar aprotic solvent admixed precursor solution at 65 degrees C and 100 degrees C for about 1 min, respectively, to form adduct films containing DMSO. Two films were sandwiched without pressure by a method called bifacial stamping, and annealed at 100 degrees C for 9 min, which resulted in complete phase transition of FAPbI(3) and led to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.34%. The stamped MAPbI(3) demonstrated a PCE of 20.18% that was much higher than the conventionally annealed MAPbI(3) (approximate to 17.4%) mainly due to a much higher fill factor and open-circuit voltage. Optical and structural studies revealed that DMSO-mediated ion exchange plays a vital role in the phase transition of FAPbI(3) and the surface modification of MAPbI(3). Theoretical calculation results further support the role of DMSO in the phase transition at low temperature. Stamping was applied to EAPbI(3) (EA = ethylammonium), where photoinactive yellow EAPbI(3) changed to photoactive EAPbI(3) with a PCE of 13.02% after stamping with MAPbI(3). The DMSO-mediated EA/MA ion exchange reaction during the stamping process created a new layer having a gradient solid solution of EAPbI(3) and MAPbI(3), which was responsible for the abnormally high PCE of the EAPbI(3) based perovskite solar cell. Facilitated ion transport by a Lewis base (such as DMSO) reservoir in the perovskite adduct film is suggested to be involved in the bifacial stamping procedure.

The roles of the LGC-D013 HTM on PeSC-performances were examined using filed-emission scanning electron microscope, atomic force microscope, photoluminescence, hole mobility, energy-level diagram, and device-resistances. The LGC-D013 based device produced a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.22%, which was 22% enhancement compared to the reference poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P313T) based device with a PCE of 9.53%.

J	Lyu, M; Chen, JZ; Park, NG				Lyu, Mei; Chen, Jiangzhao; Park, Nam-Gyu			Improvement of efficiency and stability of CuSCN-based inverted perovskite solar cells by post-treatment with potassium thiocyanate	JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Perovskite; Solar cell; Inverted; CuSCN; Thiocyanate; KSCN	CONTACT; LAYERS	We report an inverted perovskite solar cell (PSC) based on a solution-processed CuSCN thin film for hole transporting layer. Methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)) perovskite film is formed on the CuSCN layer, which shows hysteresis-less current-voltage characteristics. Post-treatment of the CuSCN film with KSCN improves power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 11.9% to 14.9% due to main increment of photocurrent density from 16.71 to 19.20 mA/cm(2). From the test with various salts of KX (X = SCN, I and Br) and MSCN (M = K and Na), we have found that thiocyanate anion plays more critical role in improving photovoltaic parameters. Photoluminescence (PL) is more quenched and PL decay time is faster after post-treatment with KSCN, which is indicative of better charge separation and responsible for the improved photocurrent density. In addition interface recombination, estimated by impedance spectroscopy, is suppressed by the post-treatment with KSCN, which is related to the improved open-circuit voltage. PSCs with KSCN-treated CuSCN demonstrates better photo- and humidity-stability as compared to those with untreated CuSCN, which is likely to correlate with improved interface.

The work function of the PEDOT:PSS was tuned from - 5.08 to - 4.05 eV by using polyethylenimine, improving the electron collection. Using PCBM improved the electron transport and suppressed the charge recombination of the PSCs. The power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of the rigid PSCs (on glass substrates) was significantly improved from 12.5% to 13.9%, and the open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current density, and fill factor were improved simultaneously. The long-term stability of the PSCs was also improved: the PCE degradation of the PSCs without encapsulation decreased from 18.4% to 13.0% after 114 h. Using a 37-nm PCBM layer, the flexible PSCs on polyethylene naphthalate substrates exhibited a high PCE of 11.4% with good bendability. Our results indicate that using PCBM as an electron transport layer in metal-oxide-free PSCs is a feasible method for the large-scale roll-to-roll production of PSCs.

Four distinct phases are identified and a morphological phase map is constructed. The formation of these phases is attributed to a delicate balance between the degree and rate of supersaturation and the flux of solution supply to the meniscus line, which dictates the nucleation and the crystal growth process. An optimal phase window is identified and the photovoltaic device under the chosen conditions exhibits a power conversion efficiency over 15%, which is comparable to that of a reference device prepared by the conventional spin-coating process. Furthermore, a large area perovskite film of 57 cm(2) is prepared. Small-area devices from different locations within the large-area film show uniform efficiencies with a deviation coefficient of 4.2%, demonstrating the high uniformity of the thin-film.

The room-temperature photoluminescence, the electron-only devices, and the impedance studies altogether suggested the interfacial properties of the alkali carbonates-modified SnO2 ETLs, which were much better than those based on the SnO2 only, provided efficient charge transport, and reduced the charge recombination rates for iOSCs. The iOSCs using the polymer donor poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b']dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl] and the fullerene acceptor phenyl-C-70-butyric acid methyl ester as the active layer showed the average power-conversion efficiencies (PCEs) based on ten devices of 6.70, 6.85, and 7.35% with Li2CO3-, K2CO3-, and Rb2CO3-modified SnO2 as ETLs, respectively; these are more than 22, 24, and 33% higher than those based on the SnO2 only (5.49%). Moreover, these iOSC devices exhibited long-term stabilities, with over 90% PCEs remaining after the devices were stored in ambient air for 6 weeks without encapsulations. We believe that alkali carbonates-modified SnO2 approaches are an effective way to achieve stable and highly efficient iOSCs and might also be suitable for other optoelectronic devices where an ETL is needed, such as perovskite solar cells or organic light-emitting diodes.

The effects of metal nanoparticles on MAPbI(3) perovskite were systematically studied using UV-Vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) measurements. As a result, the 20-nm-sized Au NPs-embedded MAPbI(3) film exhibited a 4.15% higher absorbance than the bare MAPbI(3) film. Moreover, the average PL intensity of the Au NPs-embedded MAPbI(3) film increased by about 75.25% over the bare MAPbI(3) film. Therefore, we have confirmed that addition of the Au NPs has a positive effect on the optical properties of MAPbI(3), and we believe that this study will provide a basic insight into the metal nanoparticles-embedded perovskite thin films for the future optoelectronic applications.

Although significant developments have been made through intensive studies, the stability issue is still challenging. Passivation of perovskite solar cells with a transparent polymer provides better stability; however, there are a few disadvantages of organic polymer such as low thermal stability, weak adhesion and the lack of water retention ability. In this work, we prepared a dual Parylene-F/C layer with 3- methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, A-174, to combine the advantages of organic and inorganic materials. As a result, A-174 treated dual Parylene-F/C layer demonstrated improved passivation effects compared to a single Parylene layer due to the strong binding of Parylene and the water retention ability by SiO2 formed from A-174. This synergetic effects can be expanded to the combination of other organic materials and organosilane compounds.

Even at room temperature deposition, the ion-plated ITO film showed a low sheet resistance of 15.75 Ohm per square, a high average optical transmittance of 85.88% and a small outer bending radius of 5 mm because energetic ITO ions accelerated to the substrate led to better crystallinity and adhesion than sputtered ITO films. In addition, the ion-plated ITO films showed atomically flat and smooth surfaces due to different growth mechanisms and the absence of resputtering effects during the ion plating process. Flexible perovskite solar cells fabricated on the ion-plated ITO electrodes showed a higher power conversion efficiency of 16.8% than the sputtered ITO-based perovskite solar cell, indicating the potential of ion plated ITO films as promising flexible and transparent electrodes for perovskite solar cells.

Since the first report of MHP lightemitting diodes (PeLEDs) in 2014, many researchers have devoted efforts to increase the luminescence efficiencies of MHPs in various crystal forms, and achieved dramatically improved photoluminescence quantum efficiency of > 90% in MHP emitters and external quantum efficiency of approximate to 14.36% in PeLEDs. Here, the recent progress regarding PeLEDs is reviewed by categorizing MHPs into three types: polycrystalline bulk films, colloidal nanocrystals, and single crystals. The main focus is on photophysical properties, crystallization methods, and mechanisms of various crystal formation, and applications to PeLEDs. Future research directions are also suggested and an outlook for MHP emitters and PeLEDs is given.

This study describes the fabrication of hierarchical methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)) nanoribbon (NR) arrays with controlled internal nanorod structures by simple spin-coating with solvent treatment process and investigates the suitability of these arrays for high-performance and multifunctional photodetectors. In the UV-to-800-nm range, photodetectors based on the hierarchical MAPbI(3) NR arrays exhibit specific detectivities 18.1-23.7 times higher than those of photodetectors based on MAPbI(3) films due to the effective photon management and reduced charge trap states in the hierarchical MAPbI(3) NR arrays. The solution-processed hierarchical MAPbI(3) NRs can be fabricated on various substrates including ultrathin polyimide, which facilitates the development of flexible photodetectors with highly stable photoresponse under bending strain. Furthermore, the ferroelectricity and the highly anisotropic alignment of MAPbI(3) NR arrays allow multifunctional photodetectors capable of self-powered and polarization-sensitive light detection, respectively. The strategy used to fabricate hierarchical organic-inorganic perovskite NR arrays is believed to be applicable to other types of perovskites and can probably be used to construct various optoelectronic devices based on hierarchical nanostructures.

The electrical characterization is performed with a four-point probe and a multi tester. The microstructure characterization shows that an electrode with excellent attachment to the substrate and no surface cracks at weight ratios above 0.5. The electrical characterization results show that the sheet resistance is <70 Omega/sq and the interface resistance is <70 Omega at weight ratios of 0.5 and 0.7.

However, the low exciton binding energy in MHPs leads to a competition between the trap-mediated nonradiative recombination and the bimolecular radiative recombination. Here, efficient and stable green emissive perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with an external quantum efficiency of 14.6% are demonstrated through compositional, dimensional, and interfacial modulations of MHPs. The interfacial energetics and optoelectronic properties of the perovskite layer grown on a nickel oxide (NiOx) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate hole injection interfaces are investigated. The better interface formed between the NiOx/perovskite layers in terms of lower density of traps/defects, as well as more balanced charge carriers in the perovskite layer leading to high recombination yield of carriers are the main reasons for significantly improved device efficiency, photostability of perovskite, and operational stability of PeLEDs.

The completely amorphous structure with low resistivity of 1.29 x 10-3 Omega-cm, work function of 4.69 eV, and high optical transmittance of 83.78 % was produced by addition of Ti and N structural stabilizers in the In2O3 matrix, making amorphous InTiON (a-ITON) films suitable for use as transparent anodes in PSCs. In addition, the a-ITON films exhibited good mechanical flexibility under substrate bending due to their stable amorphous structure. Compared to amorphous ITO-based PSC, which exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.07 %, the PSC with a-ITON showed a higher PCE of 13.74 % due to higher optical transmittance inducing a higher photocurrent. The suitability of an a-ITON electrode suggests it as a potential candidate to substitute for conventional oxide electrodes.

Nevertheless, necessity of reducing Pb contents in the perovskite materials is increasing due to the toxicity of Pb. Recently, tin-lead mixed perovskite materials have been studied intensively, by dissolving Sn and Pb sources simultaneously in one precursor solution. Here, for the first time, we report a two-step method to synthesize MASnI(3) and MASn(x)Pb((1-x))I(3) films. The films were prepared via spin-coating MAI or MASnI(3 )precursors on as-prepared SnS thin films. Crystal structures, phases, surface chemical states, and morphologies of the MASnI(3) and MASn(x)Pb((1-x))I(3) films were investigated. Our two-step method is expected to be used not only for Sn based perovskites but also for diverse compositions of perovskite materials.

Particularly, owing to their ability to form highly crystalline and homogeneous films utilizing low-temperature solution processes (<150 degrees C), perovskites have become promising photoactive materials for realizing high-performance flexible solar cells. However, the current use of mesoporous TiO2 scaffolds, which require high-temperature sintering processes (>400 degrees C), has limited the fabrication of perovskite solar cells on flexible substrates. Therefore, the development of a low-temperature processable charge-transporting layer has emerged as an urgent task for achieving flexible perovskite solar cells. This review summarizes the recent progress in low-temperature processable electron- and hole-transporting layer materials, which contribute to improved device performance in flexible perovskite solar cells.

In this work, we fabricated inverted 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) using a non-fullerene acceptor as electron transport material. Employing a 55-nm thick 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(5-hexylthienyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2',3' d'] s indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-bldithiophene (ITIC-Th) as electron transport layer, an average PCE of 8.4% was achieved for the 2D PSCs, which was comparable to that of 2D PSCs based on phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). However, the long-term stability of the 2D PSCs was improved as the degradation of PCE was reduced from 19.8 to 14.6% following a 15-day duration, which can be attributed to the strong hydrophobic property of the ITIC-Th. The best sample based on the 55-nm thick ITIC-Th exhibited a high PCE of 8.9% with a stable power output and negligible hysteresis, indicating the superior electron transport property of ITIC-Th. Our results demonstrate that ITIC-Th is an effective alternative to PCBM to fabricate highly efficient and stable 2D PSCs.

A two-step spin process produced a mixed halide perovskite of CH3NH3PbI3-xClx and a mixture of PbCl2 and PbI2 was deposited on CdS, followed by a sub-sequential reaction with MAI (CH3NH3I). The added PbCl2 to PbI2 in the first spin-step affected the structure, orientation, and shape of lead halides, which varied depending on the content of Cl. A small amount of Cl enhanced the surface morphology and the preferred orientation of PbI2, which led to large and uniform grains of perovskite thin films. In contrast, the high content of Cl produces a new phase PbICl in addition to PbI2, which leads to the small and highly uniform grains of perovskites. An improved surface coverage of perovskite films with the large and uniform grains maximized the performance of perovskite solar cells at 0.1 molar ratio of PbCl2 to PbI2. The depth profiling of elements in both lead halide films and mixed halide perovskite films were measured by Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy, revealing the distribution of chlorine along with the thickness, and providing the basis for the mechanism for enhanced preferred orientation of lead halide and the microstructure of perovskites.

Therefore, photo-excited state of organic HTM could become important during the solar cell operation, but this feature has not usually been considered for the HTM design. Here, we prove that enhancing their property at their photo-excited states, especially their transition dipole moments, can be a methodology to develop high efficiency p-i-n perovskite solar cells. The organic HTMs are designed to have high transition dipole moments at the excited states and simultaneously to preserve those property during the solar cell operation by their extended lifetimes through the excited-state intramolecular proton transfer process, consequently reducing the charge recombination and improving extraction properties of devices. Their UV-filtering ability is also beneficial to enhance the photostability of devices.

The PeLED consisting of ITO/ZnO/MAPbI(3) (CH3NH3PbI3)/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag structures shows a peak emission wavelength of 766nm, turn-on voltage of 1.7V, reverse breakdown voltage of -5.4V, current efficiency of 1.5x10(-4)cdA(-1), maximum luminance of 0.1 cdm(-2), and an external quantum efficiency of 0.2% at bias voltage of 3V (or a current density of 617mAcm(-2)). The PeLED also shows a significant output drop at higher bias voltage. According to the analyses of forward J-V curves and structural studies, this could be associated with the anomalously large ideality factor of 12.8 and the high series resistance of 2.8cm(2), that is, the leakage current through parasitic shunt path (possibly through pinholes in the perovskite) and accelerated Joule-heating result in a significant output degradation.

Since it is revealed that the transport of photocarriers and the migration of ionic species are affected not only by each other but also by the inhomogeneous character, which is a consequence of the route selected to deposit OHPs, understanding the nanostructural evolution during OHP deposition, in terms of the resultant structural defects, electronic traps, and nanoscopic charge behaviors, will be valuable. Investigation of the film-growth mechanisms and strategies adopted to realize OHP films with less-defective large grains is of central importance, considering that single-crystalline OHPs have exhibited the most beneficial properties, including carrier lifetimes. Critical factors governing the behavior of photocarriers, mobile ionic species, and nanoscale optoelectronic properties resulting from either or all of them are further summarized, which may potentially limit or broaden the optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications of OHPs. Through inspection of the recent advances, a comprehensive picture and future perspective of OHPs are provided.

However, those dopants can introduce undesired charge traps that hinder charge transport through TiO2, so the improvement in the V-oc is often accompanied by an undesired photocurrent density-voltage (J-V) hysteresis problem. Herein, it is demonstrated that the use of a rapid flame doping process (40 s) to introduce cobalt dopant into TiO2 not only solves the J-V hysteresis problem but also increases the V-oc and power conversion efficiency of both mesoscopic and planar PSCs. The reasons for the simultaneous improvements are two fold. First, the flame-doped Co-TiO2 film forms Co-O-v (cobalt dopant-oxygen vacancy) pairs and hence reduces the number density of Ti3+ trap states. Second, Co doping upshifts the band structure of TiO2, facilitating efficient charge extraction. As a result, for planar PSCs, the flame doping of Co increases the efficiency from 17.1% to 18.0% while reducing the hysteresis from 16.0% to 1.7%. Similarly, for mesoscopic PSCs, the flame doping of Co increases the efficiency from 18.5% to 20.0% while reducing the hysteresis from 7.0% to 0.1%.

Herein, quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) tin-based perovskite solar cells are fabricated with significantly improved performance and stability, by introducing an additional formamidinium thiocyanate (FASCN) additive into quasi-2D tin-based perovskites. The incorporation of the FASCN additive greatly prevents quasi-2D tin-based perovskites from oxidation during film formation, through strong chemical interactions with the tin component (Sn2+). Moreover, it results in a coarser perovskite grain and a higher degree of crystallinity in the out-of-plane direction, leading to enhanced optoelectronic performance of quasi-2D tin-based perovskites. The best-performing tin-based perovskite solar cell shows an efficiency of 8.17% under reverse scan with a steady-state efficiency of 7.84% at a maximum power point (MPP), while retaining over 90% of its initial efficiency after 1000 hours in a glovebox filled with nitrogen. These results demonstrate a versatile, yet simple methodology that can be applied to other lead-free perovskites suffering from poor oxidative stability.

A FA(0.88)Cs(0.12)PbI(3) formamidinium (FA) perovskite layer is first prepared, then FAPF(6) solution with different concentrations is spin-coated on top of the perovskite film, which leads to a partial substitution of iodide by PF6- ion. The second phase with nominal composition of FA(0.88)Cs(0.12)PbI(3-x)(PF6)(x) is grown at the grain boundary, which has island morphology and its size depends on the FAPF(6) solution concentration. The lattice is expanded and bandgap is reduced due to inclusion of larger PF6- ions. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) is significantly enhanced from 17.8% to 19.3% as a consequence of improved fill factor and open-circuit voltage (V-oc). In addition, current-voltage hysteresis is reduced. Post-treatment with FAPF(6) reduces defect density and enhances carrier lifetime, which is responsible for the improved photovoltaic performance and reduced hysteresis. The unencapsulated device with post-treated perovskite film demonstrates better stability than the pristine perovskite, where the initial PCE retains over 80% after 528 h exposure under relative humidity of around 50-70% in the dark and 92% after 360 h under one sun illumination.

In spite of the room temperature ion plating process, the APIP-grown IWO film showed a low sheet resistance of 37.14 Ohm/square, a high optical transmittance of 96.0%, high near IR transmittance, and a small bending radius of 5 mm. In addition, the IWO film shows an atomically smooth surface with a root mean square roughness of 0.83 nm due to the absence of the resputtering effect during the ion plating process. The FPSC with the ion-plated IWO electrode showed comparable performances to a commercial amorphous ITO electrode in an FPSC with an open circuit voltage (0.837 V), short circuit current (18.67 mA/cm(2)), fill factor (72.54%), and power conversion efficiency (11.33%). Moreover, the microstructure and interfacial structure of the APIP-grown IWO film employed in a FPSC were examined by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and the sheet resistance of the IWO films was correlated to the FPSC performance.

The exclusive properties of MAPbI(3) enable to use as a fusion energy conversion material for harvesting of ambient energy such as the thermal, mechanical and solar energy. Many researchers have focused on each of these topics separately. This paper demonstrates a flexible single structured TPS-fusion energy device comprising of interdigitated electrodes (IDEs) and MAPbI(3) to harvest thermal, mechanical and solar energy. A TPS-device is individually operated as a thermoelectric, piezoelectric, and solar (TPS)-energy harvester by independently applying a thermal gradient, mechanical force and solar energy. The TPS-device as a thermoelectric generator is exhibited the higher thermoelectric output performance in in-plane temperature gradient than out-of-plane temperature gradient. The obtained piezoelectric output values of the TPS-device as a piezoelectric generator under periodic applied pressure are 1.47 V and 0.56 mu A. The TPS-based photovoltaic device is generated an open-circuit voltage of 0.77 V and a short-circuit current density of 0.022 mA/cm(2). This conceptual demonstration of fusion energy harvesting device using IDE-based structure with light active ambipolar material could introduce innovative approaches in fusion-conversion energy technology.

In contrast to MHP polycrystalline (PC) bulk films, charge carrier recombination as well as ion migration dynamics in MHP NP films have not been studied yet despite the importance to achieve high electroluminescence efficiency in LEDs. Here, we use steady-state and transient photoluminescence measurements, and photo-responsivity analysis to study the charge carrier recombination and ion migration dynamics in MHP NP films and then, compare these with those of MHP PC films. Results show that MHP NP films do not undergo the severe ion migration and have dominant radiative recombination of excitons by efficiently confining electron-hole pairs. As a result, MHP NP films have high photo-stability, photo-responsibility, and PLQE (> 60%). Our findings provide insight into charge carrier and ion dynamics in MHP NP films, and confirm the potential of NP films for use in efficient LEDs.

The fabricated PSCs having Glass/FTO/mp-TiO2/ZrO2/perovskite/AV-C configuration exhibited current density (J(SC)) of 20.50 +/- 0.5 mAcm(-2), open circuit voltage (V-OC) of 0.965 +/- 0.02 V and fill factor (FF) of 58 2%, resulting in 12.3 +/- 0.2% power conversion efficiency (PCE) for MAPbI(3) perovskite absorber. The aloe-vera processed carbon C-HTL based PSCs yields up to 12.50% power conversion efficiency and 15.80% efficiency for conventional spiro-MeOTAD based HTM. The air and moisture stability >1000 h at >45% relative humidity (RH) for cross linked AV-C nanoparticle-based PSCs. This stability is very high compared to conventional spiro-MeOTAD HTM-based PSCs. The prepared carbon nanoparticles facilitate an excellent penetration of perovskite absorber in triple-layer-based scaffold, which enables a high-quality perovskite crystal and results in high PCE. This novel bio-inspired AV-C cross-linked nanoparticle-based natural carbon C-HTL is low-cost until date. We believe this technique would be suitable for and helpful toward fully printable and air-moisture-stable PSCs.

The flexible i-MCA films exhibited an extremely high total transmittance of similar to 93% and a haze of similar to 95% with reduced reflectance while simultaneously demonstrating water-repellent properties. Introducing i-MCA on the illuminating side of organic solar cells (OSCs)- and perovskite solar cells-rigid glass substrate showed improved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) due to the light trapping effect by multiple light bounces between cone array structures (forward scattering). This results in an increase of the optical path length in the photoactive layer. Similarly, flexible TCEs embedded with textured i-MCA increased the PCE by 14% for flexible OSCs. More importantly, i-MCA-TCE-based OSCs were highly flexible with 98% retention from the initial PCE at both 0 degrees and at 60 degrees even after 2000 bending cycles at a radius of 2 mm. This finding demonstrates that textured i-MCA is promising for improving: (a) the light harvesting efficiency of solar cells when installed in low-/high-latitude locations and (b) the wearable technology where a flexible device attached on curved objects could retain the PCE, even at an oblique angle, with respect to the normal incidence angle.

Nickel oxide (NiOX) is one of the most well-known hole transport materials for perovskite solar cells because of its wide band gap, p-type transport characteristic, good chemical stability and high optical transparency. However, pristine NiOX possesses unsatisfactory electrical properties such as high surface trap density or low electrical conductivity which could deteriorate the device performance. We thus adopted Zn as a dopant to employ the Zn-doped NiOX as a hole transport layer in the planar heterojunction PSCs as considering that not only Zn has a similar atomic size with Ni but also Zn forms highly crystalline oxide materials. As a result, 5% Zn-doped devices achieved a power conversion efficiency up to 13.72% with improvements of a V-OC by 4.0%, a J(SC) by 16.7% and a fill factor by 8.9% as compared to the un-doped NiOX counterpart.

Here, resistive switching property of HC(NH2)(2)PbI3 (FAPbI(3)) depending on structural phase is reported. It is found that 1D hexagonal FAPbI(3) (delta-FAPbI(3)), formed at relatively low temperature, is active in memristor, while 3D trigonal FAPbI3 (alpha-FAPbI(3)), formed at temperature higher than 150 degrees C, is inactive. Failure of switching from low resistance state to high resistance state is found for alpha-FAPbI(3), while delta-FAPbI(3) shows stable switching behavior. Density functional calculation reveals that iodine cluster in isotropic 3D alpha-FAPbI(3) is so stable after forming filament that the filament is hard to be ruptured at off state. However, for anisotropic delta-FAPbI(3), iodine cluster is not stable and migration barrier is much lower for c-axis (0.48 eV) than for ab-plane (0.9 eV), which is beneficial for switching. The memristor devices based on delta-FAPbI(3) demonstrate endurance up to 1200 cycles with On/Off ratio (>10(5)), retention time up to 3000 s, multilevel storage capacity, and working even at 80 degrees C.

Owing to the favorable properties of perovskite materials, perovskite solar cells exhibit excellent power conversion efficiencies and there appears great potential for future development. In this paper, we report the fabrication of a substrate with excellent optical properties by incorporating hexagonal array micro-convex (HAMC) nanostructures in it before integration with the electrode (indium tin oxide and zinc oxide) and the halide for use in organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells. This was fabricated using nanoimprint lithography which showed excellent throughput and involved simple processing methods. The HAMC nanostructured substrate showed strong light scattering as compared to that of the conventional substrate. This resulted in the increase of current density of the fabricated solar cell from 19.45 mA/cm(2) (un-patterned substrate) to 20.92 mA/cm(2) (nanostructured substrate) with accompanying increase in the external quantum efficiency and a satisfactory performance by the perovskite solar cell.

However, existing nanofabrication approaches lack the ability to control the number, location, orientation, and properties of perovskite NWs. Their growth mechanism also remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate a micro/nanofluidic fabrication technique (MNFFT) enabling both precise control and in situ monitoring of the growth of perovskite NWs. The initial nucleation point and subsequent growth path of a methylammonium lead iodide-dimethylformamide (MAPbI(3)center dot DMF) UV vis absorption spectra are measured in real time, permitting NW array can be guided by a nanochannel. In situ the study of the growth mechanism of the DMF-mediated crystallization of MAPbI(3). As an example of an application of the MNFFT, we demonstrate a highly sensitive MAPbI(3)-NW-based photodetector on both solid and flexible substrates, showing the potential of the MNFFT for low-cost, large-scale, highly efficient, and flexible optoelectronic applications.

The development of optimized compositions and deposition approaches has led to impressive improvements; however, no noticeable breakthrough in performance has been observed for these materials recently. Here, a breakthrough that enables the fabrication of vertically grown halide perovskite (VGHP) nanopillar photodetectors via a nanoimprinting crystallization technique is demonstrated. We used engraved nanopatterned polymer stamps to form VGHP nanopillars during the pressurized crystallization of the softly baked gel state of a methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3, denoted MAPI) film. The VGHP films exhibit much lower defect density and higher conductivity, as supported by current voltage characteristic measurements and conductive atomic force microscopy measurements. Ultimately, two-terminal lateral photodetectors based on the VGHP nanopillar films show a greatly enhanced photoresponse compared with flat film-based photodetectors. We expect that the deposition method presented here will help surpass the technical limits and contribute to further improvements in various halide-perovskite-based devices.

J	Park, NG; Segawa, H				Park, Nam-Gyu; Segawa, Hiroshi			Research Direction toward Theoretical Efficiency in Perovskite Solar Cells	ACS PHOTONICS			English	Article						perovskite solar cell; Shockley-Queisser; theoretical efficiency; recombination; defect; carrier management	OPEN-CIRCUIT VOLTAGE; TRANSPORT LENGTHS; CARRIER DYNAMICS; RECOMBINATION; MOBILITIES; TRIHALIDE; LIFETIMES; PHYSICS; PLANAR; LIMIT	The recently certified efficiency of 22.7% makes perovskite solar cells (PSCs) rise to the top among the thin film technologies of photovoltaics. The research activities of PSCs have been triggered by the ground-breaking report on a 9.7% efficient and 500 h-stable solid-state perovskite solar cell employing methylammonium lead iodide adsorbed on mesoporous TiO2 film and an organic hole conducting layer in 2012. However, PSCs are facing issues on stability, current-voltage hysteresis, ion migration, and so on, which should be solved for commercialization. In addition, further improvement in power conversion efficiency is still needed for PSCs. In this Perspective, the Shockley-Queisser (S-Q) limit in PSCs is investigated, where the best performing state-of-the-art PSC is used for this study. Short-circuit photocurrent density (J(sc)) is found to approach the S-Q limit, while open-circuit voltage (V-oc) and fill factor (FF) are far below their S-Q limits. Thus, toward an S-Q limit efficiency of similar to 30% for PSCs with a light absorber having a band gap of 1.6 eV, a strategy of reducing nonradiative recombination and interface recombination to achieve a theoretical V-oc and FF is more important than finding a method to improve J(sc). To this end, types of defects should be sophisticatedly characterized and engineered, although organic-inorganic halide perovskites are known to be defect-tolerant and have a benign grain boundary.

The Li-doped NiOx used as hole-extraction layer can be prepared by facile method of just adding Li source to NiOx precursor solution to form Li-doped NiOx layer. The presence of Li in NiOx layer has an influence on conductivity of the NiOx layer which is evidenced by the conductive AFM. In addition, the NiOx layer with 50 nm thickness prevents a lot of pinholes inside the film and relatively low processing temperature of 200 degrees C has the advantage of wide choice of transparent conduction oxide substrate. As a result, p-i-n type planar perovskite solar cell incorporating the Li-doped NiOx hole-extraction layer is improved with significantly enhanced fill factor leading to increase in conversion efficiency of 15.41%.

It is crucial to finely optimize the energy level matching between the perovskites and hole-transporting materials to achieve better performance. Here, we synthesize a fluorene-terminated hole-transporting material with a fine-tuned energy level and a high glass transition temperature to ensure highly efficient and thermally stable PSCs. We use this material to fabricate photovoltaic devices with 23.2% efficiency (under reverse scanning) with a steady-state efficiency of 22.85% for small-area (-0.094 cm(2)) cells and 21.7% efficiency (under reverse scanning) for large-area (-1 cm(2)) cells. We also achieve certified efficiencies of 22.6% (small-area cells, -0.094 cm(2)) and 20.9% (large-area, -1 cm(2)). The resultant device shows better thermal stability than the device with spiro-OMeTAD, maintaining almost 95% of its initial performance for more than 500 h after thermal annealing at 60 degrees C.

This novel synthetic method was effective in producing all perovskite powders in large-scale with high yield and purity. These synthesized perovskite powders exhibited excellent intrinsic stability under ambient condition (30 degrees C with 60% relative humidity) for 8 months without any deterioration in crystallographic properties. In addition, all powders showed high chemical and thermogravimetric stability. Their excellent stability could be attributed to high purity and superior crystallinity in the powder form, resulting in strong ionic interactions of crystal lattices. Device with perovskite powders showed photocurrent-voltage characteristics compatible to those of conventional perovskite film. The novel technique for the preparation of perovskite powders in large-scale with different grain sizes and boundaries could be beneficial for other diverse applications, including light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, memory devices, and transistors.

It has been reported that substrate wettability and perovskite grain size are to be compromised with necessity, as promoted heterogeneous nucleation that occurs on a hydrophilic surface reduces the grain size for a two-step deposition method. Herein, the increase in grain size on hydrophilic surfaces in the presence of hydroxyl groups and the direct correlation between the perovskite grain formation and photovoltaic performance are investigated. The surface energy of the hole transport layer in planar p-i-n type perovskite solar cells is modulated by the introduction of polymer surfactant additive, poly(ethylene glycol) tridecyl ether (PTE). Perovskite films deposited on a hydrophilic surface by a two-step method contain small grain size, leading to a reduction in photovoltaic performance. In contrast, surface hydroxyl groups were found to induce the preferential (110) orientation and large grain size in the perovskite films deposited by means of a one-step method. Nucleation and growth mechanisms are proposed to explain those different behaviors of the dependence of grain size on surface energy. The enlarged perovskite grains on hydrophilic surfaces lead to an efficiency improvement owing to an increase in the short-circuit current and fill factor. Our study highlights that the grain size increase and high crystallinity can be achieved even with accelerated heterogeneous nucleation on a hydrophilic substrate surface.

A crosslinking system was successfully formed inside the PEDOT:PSS film by simple and fast photo-polymerization of PCDSA monomers. Combination of the crosslinking system and MeOH surface treatment simultaneously improved the device efficiency and stability of both perovskite and polymer solar cells. The crosslinking system inside PEDOT:PSS changed its intrinsic water-soluble characteristic into a water-resistant property, thus preventing water penetration into the PEDOT:PSS film. In addition, MeOH treatment improved the surface conductivity and reduced the surface roughness of the PEDOT:PSS film by removing surface residues of PDAs and insulating PSS parts.

For large-area PSCs, more reproducibility is required to precisely control the crystallization behavior of perovskites. A two-step process has been preferred to apply large-area coatings of perovskite because of its better reproducibility, but the process has suffered from slow and incomplete conversion of PbI2 to perovskite. In this paper, we propose a fast, simple, two-step methodmediator extraction treatment (MET)for the preparation of a high-quality perovskite film. In MET, a pre-deposited PbI2-DMSO complex film is converted into a peculiar PbI2 film with a porous morphology and unusual crystallographic orientation via the removal of DMSO. PbI2 could be completely converted into MAPbI(3) by a fast reaction with MAI molecules. We demonstrate that this MET process in MAPbI(3)-based PSCs can achieve 18.8% of the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) using spin-coating, and 18.3% of the maximum PCE using slot-die coating with a uniform distribution in a 10 x10 cm(2) substrate at a laboratory scale. Moreover, over 18% of PCE could be achieved in only 100 s, and with room-temperature processing.

In this work, a uniformly distributed layer of Au nanorods (AuNRs) is integrated into vertically structured perovskite photoconductive photodetectors and, as a result, perovskite-AuNR hybrid photodetectors that exhibit significant photocurrent enhancements are reported. Ultimately it achieves a responsivity of approximate to 320 A W-1 at a low driving voltage of -1 V. This is an improvement of 60% compared to the responsivity of pristine devices (approximate to 200 A W-1). The high responsivity and low driving voltage place this device among the highest performing perovskite-based thin-film photoconductive photodetectors reported. The stability and linearity of the photoresponse following repeated light/dark cycles are characterized. The hybrid device also shows a fast response (with the decay time of approximate to 95 ns) compared to pristine devices (approximate to 230 ns). The improvements in photodetection performance are attributed to plasmon-enhanced optical absorption, as well as advances in charge extraction and transport.

Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is the most suitable technology for commercialization and could potentially provide a future perspective for stable and efficient perovskite-based electronic devices. Until now, systematic investigation has addressed neither the preparation nor the intrinsic stability of these materials under both dark and illuminated conditions given the high humidity of perovskite films deposited by CVD. In the present study, we investigated the stability of perovskite films under dark and illuminated conditions coupled with temperature under an open-air atmosphere via the tuning of various deposition parameters. CVD-deposited MAPbI(3) films with no additives showed structural and optical properties at a predominant level of stability for similar to 2000 h in dark and similar to 1000 h under ambient room lighting, which achieved a significantly higher level of stability than that of either solution-processed perovskite films with or without additives, or for composites with polymers. The outstanding stability of CVD-deposited MAPbI(3) films is attributed to their large grain sizes with high levels of crystalline quality and chemical purity.	[Pammi, S. V.

Here, we report a new architecture for reinforcing the built-in electric field (E-in) across the photoactive layer with a pair of strong electric dipole layers (EDLs). The paired EDLs significantly intensify the E-in across the perovskite layer, resulting in suppressed charge trapping of photogenerated charges. As a result, our low-temperature processed P-I-N planar PeSC devices using the paired EDLs exhibit a higher power conversion efficiency (eta(max) similar to 19.4%) and a smaller device-to-device variation with a standard deviation (S. D.) of 0.70%, which far surpass those (eta(max) similar to 17.8%, S.D. similar to 1.1%) of the devices with typical charge transport layers.

PSCs have reached efficiencies of 22.70% and 18.36% on rigid fluorine-doped tin oxide and poly(ethylene terephthalate) substrates, respectively; these are comparable to those of single-crystal silicon and copper-indium-gallium-selenium solar cells. Over the past eight years, the photo conversion efficiency of PSCs has been significantly improved by device-architecture adjustments, and absorber and electron/hole transport layer optimization.

We found that this technique could result in a smoother morphology of the spiro-OMeTAD layer, which further improved the contacts at the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD and spiro-OMeTAD/Au interfaces. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs improved from 14.62 to 16.73% along with simultaneous enhancements of the open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current density. and fill factor. The hysteresis of the PSCs decreased significantly from 4.4 to 0.6%. Moreover, the degradation in the PCE of the PSCs for long-term storage was reduced from 19 to 14% over the period of 144 hours. The best PSC based on a solvent vapor-annealed spiro-OMeTAD layer exhibited a high PCE of 17.15% with a stable power output. Our results indicate that using solvent vapor annealing to control the morphology of spiro-OMeTAD layers is an effective method for fabricating high-performance PSCs.

To overcome this drawback, we synthesized a copolymer (P(SS-co-TFPMA)) ionomer consisting of PSS and tetrafluoropropylmethacrylate (TFPMA) as an alternative to conventional PEDOT:PSS. The PEDOT:P(SS-co-TFPMA) copolymer solution and its film exhibited excellent homogeneity and high phase stability compared with a physical mixture of TFPMA with PEDOT:PSS solution. During spin coating, a selforganized conducting PEDOT:P(SS-co-TFPMA) HEL evolved and the topmost PEDOT:P(SS-co-TFPMA) film showed a hydrophobic surface with a higher WF compared to that of the pristine PEDOT:PSS film because of its chemically bonded electron-withdrawing fluorinated functional groups. Interestingly, the WF of the conventional PEDOT:PSS film dramatically deteriorated after being coated with a perovskite layer, whereas the PEDOT:P(SSco-TFPMA) film represented a relatively small influence. Because of the superior energy-level alignment between the HEL and a perovskite layer even after the contact, the open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, and fill factor of the inverted planar p-i-n PSCs (IP-PSCs) with PEDOT:P(SS-co-TFPMA) were improved from 0.92 to 0.98 V, 18.96 to 19.66 mA/cm(2), and 78.96 to 82.43%, respectively, resulting in a 15% improvement in the power conversion efficiency vs that of IP PSCs with conventional PEDOT:PSS. Moreover, the IP-PSCs with PEDOT:P(SS-co-TFPMA) layer showed not only improved photovoltaic performance but also enhanced device stability due to hydrophobic surface of PEDOT:P(SS-co-TFPMA) film.

Since the first report, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) has increased rapidly through the control of morphology and structure from 0.1% to more than 11%. Here, we report the use of various conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) as the hole injection layer in PeLEDs. In particular, we find that poly[2,6-(4,4-bis-potassium butanylsulfonate)-4H-cyclopenta-[2,1-b;3,4-b']-dithiophene)] (PCPDT-K) transfers holes effectively, blocks electron transport from the perovskite to the underlying ITO layer, and reduces luminescence quenching at the perovskite/PCPDT-K interface. Our optimized PeLEDs with PCPDT-K show enhanced EQE by a factor of approximately 4 compared to control PeLEDs with PEDOT:PSS, reaching EQE values of 5.66%, and exhibit improved device stability.

It shows interesting properties that are suitable for absorber layer of solar cell. An optimized solar cell requires 200-400 nm thick absorber layer. However, the thin absorber layer inevitably contains grain of crystallites and hence grain boundary (GB) defects. The GB defects affect device performance. Therefore, we theoretically investigated the effects of GB defects on performance of solar cells. In this simulation studies, we kept total mid-gap defect density (N-d) as constant at 4x10(17) cm(-3) but varied the GB defect density (GB(dd)) from 3x10(12) cm(-3) to 3x10(22) cm(-3), because of which, the observed short circuit current density (J(sc)) of the cells remain nearly unchanged, but the open circuit voltage (V-oc) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) decreased steadily, while the fill factor (FF) shows a different trend of variation in a region (Region-X, say) where the GB(dd) and the N-d were nearly equal. A further investigation reveals that in the Region-X, a transition happens from defect mediated recombination to GB mediated recombination, where the reverse saturation current density (J(0)) and diode ideality factor (n) of the solar cells, reduce sharply from 3.46x10(-13) A cm(-2) to 2.65x10(-19) A cm(-2) and 1.9 to 1.1, respectively for a cell with 200 nm thick absorber layer. For 400 nm thick absorber layer, reduction of these parameters was 1.96x10(-13) A cm(-2) to 1.20x10(-17) A cm(-2) and 1.8 to 1.2 respectively.	[Iftiquar, S.

However, its incompatibility with formamidinium (FA)-based perovskites has impeded further enhancement of photovoltaic performance and stability. Here, we report an efficient and reproducible method to fabricate highly uniform FAPbI(3) films via the adduct approach. Replacement of the typical Lewis base dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) enabled the formation of a stable intermediate adduct phase, which can be converted into a uniform and pinhole-free FAPbI(3) film. Infrared and computational analyses revealed a stronger interaction between NMP with the FA cation than DMSO, which facilitates the formation of a stable FAI-PbI2 center dot NMP adduct. On the basis of the molecular interactions with different Lewis bases, we proposed criteria for selecting the Lewis bases. Owed to the high film quality, perovskite solar cells with the highest PCE over 20% (stabilized PCE of 19.34%) and average PCE of 18.83 +/- 0.73% were demonstrated.

While research studies on the semiconducting or electronic properties of perovskite materials in solar cells and light-emitting diodes have been actively investigated, studies on their electrolytic or ionic behavior have rarely been conducted. To probe the electrolyte properties of the metal halide perovskite, we have fabricated solution-processed zinc oxide (ZnO) thin-film transistors using a methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) perovskite thin film as a gate insulator material. The resulting perovskite film revealed ionic characteristics, with an ionic conductivity of about 10(-8) S/cm. The perovskite-gated ZnO transistors exhibited typical n-type characteristics with an average field-effect mobility of 0.047 cm(2)/V s at a low applied voltage below 2 V because of the electrical double layer formed by mobile I- anions and CH3NH3+ cations in the perovskite gate dielectric. In addition, the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) transistors gated with the perovskite showed an abnormal increase in the channel current when applying positive gate bias, probably because of the confined ion movement inside the perovskite gate insulator.

Developments of device layout and high-quality perovskite film eventually lead to a PCE over 22%. As of October 31, 2017, the highest PCE of 22.7% is listed in an efficiency chart provided by NREL. In this Review, the methodologies to obtain highly efficient PSCs are described in detail. In order to achieve a PCE of over 20% reproducibly, key technologies are disclosed from the viewpoint of precursor solution chemistry, processing for defect-free perovskite films, and passivation of grain boundaries. Understanding chemical species in precursor solution, crystal growth kinetics, light-matter interaction, and controlling defects is expected to give important insights into not only reproducible production of high PCE over 20% but also further enhancement of the PCE of PCSs.

However, the presence of toxic elements and chemical instability under an ambient atmosphere hindered lead halide perovskites from real device applications because of environmental issues and stability. Here, we demonstrate a resistive switching memory device based on a lead-free bismuth halide perovskite (CH3NH3)(3)Bi2I9 (MABI). The active layer of the device can be easily prepared by solvent engineering. The nonvolatile memory based on MABI layers has reliable retention properties (similar to 10(4) s), endurance (300 cycles), and switching speed (100 ns), as well as environmental stability. Moreover, the control of the compliance current leads to multilevel data storage with four resistance states, which can be applied to high-density memory devices. These results suggest that MABI has potential applications in information storage.

Among them, slot-die coating is a promising candidate for roll-to-roll processing because of high throughput, easy module patterning, and a premetered coating system. In this work, we employed mixed lead precursors consisting of PbAc2 and PbCl2 to fabricate PeSCs via slot-die coating. We observed that slot-die-coated perovskite films based on the mixed lead precursors exhibited well-grown and uniform morphology, which was hard to achieve by using only a single lead source. Consequently, PeSCs made with this precursor system showed improved device performance and reproducibility over single PbAc2. Lastly, a large-area module with an active area of 10 cm(2) was fabricated with a power conversion efficiency of 8.3%.

J	Mali, SS; Patil, JV; Kim, H; Hong, CK				Mali, Sawanta S.; Patil, Jyoti V.; Kim, Hyungjin; Hong, Chang Kook			Synthesis of SnO2 nanofibers and nanobelts electron transporting layer for efficient perovskite solar cells	NANOSCALE			English	Article							EXTRACTION; NANOCRYSTALS; NANOTUBES; TIO2	The implementation of positive alternative electron transporting layers (ETLs) with excellent electronic properties is a most promising method to up-scale low-cost highly efficient perovskite solar cell (PSC) technology. The present work demonstrates the preparation of tin oxide (SnO2) nanofibers (NF) and nanobelts (NB) as an electron transporting layer (ETL) for PSCs. The smooth and uniform nanofibers and nanobelts have been prepared using an electrospinning technique followed by calcination at 600 degrees C. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) analysis performed on the as-spun polyvinylpyrrolidone-tin oxide (PVP-SnO2) composite suggests that a calcination temperature of 600 degrees C is required to obtain pure SnO2 and to ensure complete removal of PVP along with other organic solvents. The structural analysis confirmed the presence of the pure tetragonal rutile phase of SnO2 nanofibers and nanobelts. The prepared nanofibers and nanobelts were further used as ETLs for PSCs. Our optimized experimental parameters yielded a J(SC) of 22.46 mA cm(-2), a V-OC of 1.081 V and FF of 66%, leading to >16% power conversion efficiency (PCE) for SnO2 nanobelts using an (FAPbI(3))(0.85)(MAPbI(3))(0.15) perovskite absorber layer with good stability. The obtained PCE is much higher than that of the SnO2 NF (12.893%) morphology. Nevertheless, the synthesis of SnO2 NF/NB ETLs provides a simple, low-cost and large-scale method for PSCs.

With the metal encapsulation effectively protecting the perovskite cell and also functioning as electrocatalyst, the high-performance perovskite photoelectrodes exhibit high photovoltage and photocurrent that are effectively inherited from the original solid-state solar cell. More importantly, thus-fabricated perovskite photo electrode demonstrates record-long unprecedented stability even at highly oxidizing potential in strong alkaline electrolyte. We expect that this versatile lift-off process can be adapted in a wide variety of photoelectrochemical devices to protect the material surfaces from corroding electrolyte and facilitate various electrochemical reactions.

The Cs4PbBr6 MCs are synthesized via an anti-solvent induced crystallization of PbBr2:CsBr directly in dimethylsulf-oxide (DMSO) by introducing HBr (HBr, 48% aqueous solution). The ratio of HBr and DMSO plays a vital role in the formation of Cs4PbBr6. By controlling the HBr/DMSO ratio, pure Cs4PbBr6 or the CsPbBr3 phase can be obtained. The Cs4PbBr6 MCs were initially obtained by adding HBr to CsBr:PbBr2/DMSO. However, on increasing the amount of the added HBr, Cs4PbBr6 MCs were converted to CsPbBr3 MCs and the photoluminescence (PL) disappeared. It was also found that CsPbBr3 MCs can be transformed to Cs4PbBr6 MCs by simply adding DMSO to the dried CsPbBr3 MCs. The Cs4PbBr6 MCs exhibit a strong PL at 516 nm with a full width at half-maximum of 25 nm regardless of the crystal size (5-10 mu m). On using Cs4PbBr6 MCs as a light converter in ultraviolet light emitting diodes, a PL intensity that is 3 times higher than that of CsPbBr3 quantum dots based devices could be achieved, unraveling the potential of this material for optoelectronic applications.

Herein, simple molecular designed hole transporting materials (HTM), such as the carbazole derivative CzP and a novel fluorinated analogue CzPF, are investigated in planar perovskite solar cells. A comparison of the CzP and CzPF properties clearly demonstrates that the addition of a fluorine atom increases the hole mobility. A power conversion efficiency close to 13% in MAPbI(3) planar structure devices was obtained using these amorphous carbazole- based HTMs. This result clearly demonstrates that both CzP and CzPF materials, owing to improved charge transfer and low hysteresis, lead to similar photovoltaic performances compared to the commonly used spiro-OMeTAD.

Surface analysis using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the formation of 2D perovskite. Hysteresis is reduced by the interfacial 2D layer, which could be ascribed to improvement of interfacial charge extraction efficiency, associated with suppression of recombination. Moreover, introduction of the interface passivating layer enhances the moisture stability and photostability as compared to the control perovskite film due to hydrophobic nature of 2D perovskite. The unencapsulated device retains 98% of the initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after 63 d under moisture exposure of about 10% in the dark. A PCE of the control device is boosted from 13.72 to 16.75% as a consequence of enhanced opencircuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor along with slightly increased short-circuit current density (Jsc), which results from reduced trap states of (FAPbI(3))(0.88)(CsPbBr3)(0.12) as evidenced by enhanced carrier lifetimes and charge extraction. The perovskite/hole transport material interface engineering gives insight into simultaneous improvements of PCE and device stability.

Herein, it is demonstrated that a small quantity of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) added to the precursor solution effectively inhibits the formation of the yellow alpha-phase during film preparation, and promotes the development of a black alpha-phase at a low crystallization temperature. A systematic study reveals that a thin, dense, pinhole-free CsPbI3 film is produced in the alpha-phase and is stabilized with PEO that effectively reduces the grain size during crystallization. A thin alpha-phase CsPbI3 film with excellent photoluminescence is successfully employed in a light-emitting diode with an inverted configuration of glass substrate/indium tin oxide/zinc oxide/poly(ethyleneimine)/-CsPbI3/poly(4-butylphenyl-diphenyl-amine)/WO3/Al, yielding the characteristic red emission of the perovskite film at 695 nm with brightness, external quantum efficiency, and emission band width of approximate to 101 cd m(-2), 1.12%, and 32 nm, respectively.

The IHSA-PDMS/glass possessed superior antireflection (AR) characteristics with the highest/lowest average transmittance/reflectance (T-avg/R-avg) values of approximately 89.2%/6.4% compared to the HSA-PDMS/glass, flat-PDMS/glass, and bare glass (T-avg/R-avg similar to 88.8%/7.5%, 87.5%/7.9%, and 87.3%/8.8%, respectively). In addition, the IHSA-PDMS/glass also exhibited a relatively strong light-scattering property with the higher average haze ratio (H-avg) of similar to 38% than those of the bare glass, flat-PDMS/glass, and HSA-PDMS/glass (i.e., H-avg approximate to 1.1, 1.7, and 34.2%, respectively). At last, to demonstrate the practical feasibility under light control of the solar cells, the IHSA-PDMS was laminated onto the glass substrates of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as an AR layer, and their device performances were explored. Consequently, the short-circuit current density of the PSCs integrated with the IHSA-PDMS AR layer was improved by similar to 17% when compared with the device without AR layer, resulting in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 19%. Therefore, the IHSA-PDMS is expected to be applied as an AR layer for solar cells to enhance their light absorption as well as the PCE.

J	Lee, H; Lee, C				Lee, Hyunho; Lee, Changhee			Analysis of Ion-Diffusion-Induced Interface Degradation in Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells via Restoration of the Ag Electrode	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						degradation; electrode restoration; inverted perovskite solar cells; ion diffusion; temperature analysis	TRANSPORT LAYERS; CH3NH3PBI3; SPECTROSCOPY; EFFICIENT; HUMIDITY	Straightforward evidence for ion-diffusion-induced interfacial degradation in inverted perovskite solar cells is presented. Over 1000 h, solar cells inevitably undergo degradation, especially with respect to the current density and fill factor. The Ag electrode is peeled off and re-evaporated to investigate the effect of the Ag/[6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) interfacial degradation on the photovoltaic performance at days 10 (240 h), 20 (480 h), 30 (720 h), and 40 (960 h). The power conversion efficiency increases after the Ag electrode restoration process. While the current density shows a slightly decreased value, the fill factor and open-circuit voltage increase for the new electrode devices. The decrease in the activation energy due to the restored Ag electrode induces recovery of the fill factor. The diffused I-ions react with the PCBM molecules, resulting in a quasi n-doping effect of PCBM. Upon electrode exchange, the reversible interaction between the iodine ions and PCBM causes current density variation. The disorder model for the open-circuit voltage over a wide range of temperatures explains the open-circuit voltage increase at every electrode exchange. Finally, the degradation mechanism of the inverted perovskite solar cell over 1000 h is described under the proposed recombination system.

The asy-PBTBDT with a high MW(132 kDa) had the highest mh values (4.91 x 10(-3) cm(2)V(-1) s(-1) without dopants and 5.77 x 10(-3) cm(2)V(-1) s(-1) with dopants) as a result of increase in the p-p stacking along with MW as compared to lowMW asy-PBTBDTs (27 and 8 kDa). The high-MW asy-PBTBDT with a high mh achieved the best power conversion efficiencies of 18.2% and 20.0% for the undoped and doped states in PerSCs, respectively, and 5.7% in PSCs in green processed devices. Furthermore, the glass transition temperature increased with an increase in MW; this indicated an effective decrease in heat-induced morphological degradation in the photovoltaic devices. In addition, an increase in the chain density along with MW led to good robustness against humidity and oxygen.

Simply pressing polyurethane stamps with hexagonal nanodot arrays on partially dried perovskite intermediate films can cause pressure-induced perovskite crystallization. This pressure-induced crystallization allows to prepare highly efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs) because the preferred-orientation and enlarged grains with low-angle grain boundaries in the perovskite films exhibit suppressed nonradiative recombination. Consequently, the photovoltaic response is dramatically improved by the uniaxial compression in both inverted-planar PSCs and normal PSCs, leading to power conversion efficiencies of 19.16%.

However, the thermal generation of free charges at room temperature results in a low radiative recombination rate and an excitation-intensity-dependent PLQY, which is associated with the trap density. Here, we report perovskite films composed of uniform nanosized single crystals (average diameter = 31.7 nm) produced by introducing bulky amine ligands and performing the growth at a lower temperature. By effectively controlling the crystal growth, we maximized the radiative bimolecular recombination yield by reducing the trap density and spatially confining the charges. Finally, highly bright and efficient green emissive perovskite light emitting diodes that do not suffer from electroluminescence blinking were achieved with a luminance of up to 55 400 cd m(-2), current efficiency of 55.2 cd A(-1), and external quantum efficiency of 12.1%.

Among the many issues involved in commercialization of this technology as a consumer product, lead-based materials in these systems must be replaced. This requires the use of a low-cost, low-loss, and non-toxic chemical, along with the development of an eco-friendly manufacturing process. Herein, we review recent progress in eco-friendly colloidal quantum dot photovoltaics, with a focus on two aspects. First, we examine non-toxic or less-toxic quantum dot materials designed for efficient thin-film based solar cells by considering factors such as bandgap tunability, exciton binding energy, and more. We then present the performance of quantum dot solar cells using these green quantum dot materials, and discuss the scientific and technological issues facing them. Second, we review fabrication methods of quantum dot thin films with low-cost, low-waste, and non-toxic chemicals, for use in eco-friendly manufacturing processes.

An Au electrode with a thickness of 70 nm was prepared with one-step and two-step processes using a general thermal evaporator with a 30 cm source-substrate distance and 6.0 x 10(-6) torr vacuum. The one-step process deposits the Au film with the desirable thickness through a source power of 60 and 100 W at a time. The two-step process deposits a 7 nm-thick buffer layer with source power of 60, 70, and 80 W, and then deposits the remaining film thickness at higher source power of 80, 90, and 100W. The photovoltaic properties and microstructure of these PSC devices with a glass/FTO/TiO2/perovskite/HTL/Au electrode were measured by a solar simulator and field emission scanning electron microscope. The one-step process showed a low depo-temperature of 88.5 degrees C with a long deposition time of 90 minutes at 60 W. It showed a high depo-temperature of 135.4 degrees C with a short deposition time of 8 minutes at 100 W. All the samples showed an ECE lower than 2.8% due to damage on the HTL. The two-step process offered an ECE higher than 6.25% without HTL damage through a deposition temperature lower than 88 degrees C and a short deposition time within 20 minutes in general. Therefore, the proposed two-step process is favorable to produce an Au electrode layer for the PSC device with a general thermal evaporator.

Recent work on an inverted-structure QDSC has revealed that the junction between the QD layers is the dominant junction, rather than the junction between the ETL and the QD layers, which is in contrast to the conventional wisdom. However, to date, there have been a lack of systematic studies on the role and importance of the QD heterojunction structure on the behavior of the solar cell and the resulting device performance. In this study, we have systematically controlled the structure of the QD junction to balance charge transport, which demonstrates that the position of the junction has a significant effect on the hysteresis effect, fill factor, and solar cell performance and is attributed to balanced charge transport.

Dense TiO2 and PbI2 films were formed in a N-2 glove box regardless of the spinning time; in contrast, porous TiO2 and PbI2 films were formed in a humid atmosphere. The formation mechanism of the porous TiO2 film was suggested to be a sol-gel reaction resulting from the reaction between the wet-state alkoxide film and water molecules in the humid environment during spinning, whereas a TiO2 xerogel structure was formed without the sol-gel reaction in the non-humid environment. In addition, it was suggested that the porous PbI2 film was formed via a reaction between the wet-state film and water. In conclusion, control of the reaction between the coated wet film and water molecules was important for coating optimized b-TiO2 and PbI2 films.

In this review, the decoupled dipole moments at the interface are investigated and clarified by using both the theoretical and experimental findings, with particular focus on dipolar interface materials and the consequent energy level alignment in organic and hybrid perovskite solar cells. The mechanisms of interface dipole moments in the interface layer are evaluated by using spontaneously and nonspontaneously aligned dipolar molecules, thereby the energy-level adjustment of the dipolar interface layer in the devices are elucidated. The diverse dipolar interface materials (e.g., self-assembled monolayers, conjugated or nonconjugated polymer, neutral molecules or electrolytes, zwitterion based molecules, electrolyte grafted copolymer) are introduced and classified according to their working mechanisms of decoupled dipole moments at the interface. We conclude that an efficient interface material and its particular treatment can be designed and developed by exploring the underlying mechanisms of the decoupled dipole moments. Therefore, device characteristics may be advanced by the insights provided in this review.

The TFE is composed of a multilayer stack of organic/inorganic layers deposited by initiated chemical vapor deposition and atomic layer deposition, respectively, whose water vapor transmission rate is on the order of 10(-4) g m(-2) d(-1) at an accelerated condition of 38 degrees C and 90% relative humidity (RH). The TFE is optimized, taking into consideration various aspects of thermosensitive PSCs. Lowering the process temperature is one of the most effective methods for minimizing the thermal damage to the PSC during the monolithic integration of the TFE onto PSC. The direct deposition of TFE onto a PSC causes less than 0.3% degradation (from 18.5% to 18.2%) in the power conversion efficiency, while the long-term stability is substantially improved; the PSC retains 97% of its original efficiency after a 300 h exposure to an accelerated condition of 50 degrees C and 50% RH, confirming the enhanced stability of the PSC against moisture. This is the first demonstration of a TFE applied directly onto PSCs in a damage-free manner, which will be a powerful tool for the development of highly stable PSCs with high efficiency.

Herein, we demonstrate a new strategy in which zinc sulfide (ZnS) is used as an interfacial modifier between mesoporous-TiO2 (mp-TiO2) and a CH3NH3PbI3 absorber layer via the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method. The layer thickness of ZnS was optimized, and its effects on the conduction band position, interfacial charge recombination, and photovoltaic performance were investigated. Our results revealed that an ultrathin ZnS layer on mp-TiO2 helps in suppressing backflow of electrons, effectively reducing interfacial charge recombination and facilitating electron transfer. Our best performing perovskite solar cell device using the mp-TiO2-ZnS achieved a power conversion efficiency of 14.9%, with an open-circuit voltage of 1.02 V, short-circuit current density of 19.05mA cm(-2), and fill factor of 75.43%. Our simple ZnS IM approach proves that interface engineering could be a key strategy in improving the performance of perovskite solar cells. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that DMI weakly coordinates with PbI2 and forms a CH3NH3PbI3 film (film-DMI) with no intermediate phase. The surface of annealed film-DMI (film-DMI-A) was smooth, with an average crystal size of 1 cm. Photoluminescence and transient photovoltage measurements show that film-DMI-A exhibits a longer carrier lifetime than a CH3NH3PbI3 film prepared using the strongly coordinating additive dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (film-DMSO-A) because of the reduced number of defect sites in film-DMI-A. A solar cell based on film-DMI-A exhibits a higher power conversion efficiency (17.6%) than that of a cell based on film-DMSO-A (15.8%). Furthermore, the performance of the film-DMI-A solar cell is less sensitive to the ratio between PbI2 and DMI, and film-DMI can be fabricated under a high relative humidity of 55%.

X-ray diffraction patterns and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images demonstrated the formation of perovskite NPs. The optical transmittance of the perovskite NPs/glass was above 80% over the entire range of visible wavelengths, indicative of high transparency. The PDs based on CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite NPs were sensitive to a broad range of visible light from 450 to 650 nm. The currents in the PDs under exposure to red, green, and blue light-emitting diodes were enhanced to 5, 10, and 20 times that of the PD in the dark, respectively. The rise and the decay times of the PDs were 50 and 120 mu s. The current in the perovskite NP PD on a polyethylene terephthalate substrate was enhanced by approximately 69% when the NP PD was exposed to a blue LED emitting at a wavelength of 459 nm.

As polycrystalline halide perovskite thin films, which have been studied so far, have crucial limitations, low-dimensional halide perovskites have attracted attention due to their unique optical properties and charge transport properties, which have not been observed before. This review highlights the limitations of polycrystalline halide perovskites thin films and the unique characteristics of low-dimensional halide perovskite nanostructures including their electrical, optical, and chemical properties. After introducing the recent developments of various low-dimensional halide perovskite nanostructures including the synthesis methods, their properties, and applications, a brief overview of the challenges of low-dimensional halide perovskites as candidates for future optoelectronics and electronic devices is provided.

The role of PAN HELs with AuCl3 and their effects on solar cell performances were studied with ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, internal resistances in PPVs, and current-voltage power curves. The resultant PPVs with AuCl3-treated PAN HELs showed improved cell efficiency compared to PSCs with no interlayer and PAN without AuCl3. Furthermore, with AuCl3-treated PAN, we finally achieved a high efficiency of 6.91%, and a desirable PPV-stability in poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b: 4,5-b'] dithiophe-ne-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-thylhexyl) carbonyl]-thieno[3,4-b] thiophenediyl]]:[6,6] phenyl-C-71 butyric acid methyl ester (PTB7: PC71BM) solar cells, which is a comparable efficiency to the conventional devices with poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophen): poly (styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), but showing better PPV-stability than PEDOT:PSS.

JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							ORGANOMETAL TRIHALIDE PEROVSKITE; I-V HYSTERESIS; LATTICE-PARAMETER; ION MIGRATION; EFFICIENCY; FORMAMIDINIUM; IMPACT; LAYER; BORON	Organic-inorganic halide perovskite is believed to be a potential candidate for high efficiency solar cells because power conversion efficiency (PCE) was certified to be more than 22%. Nevertheless, mismatch of PCE due to current density (J)-voltage (V) hysteresis in perovskite solar cells is an obstacle to overcome. There has been much lively debate on the origin of J-V hysteresis; however, effective methodology to solve the hysteric problem has not been developed. Here we report a universal approach for hysteresis-free perovskite solar cells via defect engineering. A severe hysteresis observed from the normal mesoscopic structure employing TiO2 and spiro-MeOTAD is almost removed or does not exist upon doping the pure perovskites, CH3NH3PbI3 and HC(NH2)(2)PbI3, and the mixed cation/anion perovskites, FA(0.85)MA(0.15)PbI(2.55)Br(0.45) and FA(0.85)MA(0.1)Cs(0.05)PbI(2.7)Br(0.3), with potassium iodide. Substantial reductions in low-frequency capacitance and bulk trap density are measured from the KI-doped perovskite, which is indicative of trap-hysteresis correlation. A series of experiments with alkali metal iodides of LiI, NaI, KI, RbI and CsI reveals that potassium ion is the right element for hysteresis-free perovskite. Theoretical studies suggest that the atomistic origin of the hysteresis of perovskite solar cells is not the migration of iodide vacancy but results from the formation of iodide Frenkel defect. Potassium ion is able to prevent the formation of Frenkel defect since K+ energetically prefers the interstitial site. A complete removal of hysteresis is more pronounced at mixed perovskite system as compared to pure perovskites, which is explained by lower formation energy of K interstitial (-0.65 V for CH3NH3PbI3 vs -1.17 V for mixed perovskite). The developed KI doping methodology is universally adapted for hysteresis-free perovskite regardless of perovskite composition and device structure.

Here, we demonstrate highly efficient and stable inverted perovskite solar cells by applying a GO-doped PEDOT: PSS (PEDOT: GO) film as an HTL. The high performance of this solar cell stems from the excellent optical and electrical properties of the PEDOT: GO film, including a higher electrical conductivity, a higher work function related to the reduced contact barrier between the perovskite layer and the PEDOT: GO layer, enhanced crystallinity of the perovskite crystal, and suppressed leakage current. Moreover, the device with the PEDOT: GO layer showed excellent long-term stability in ambient air conditions. Thus, the enhancement in the efficiency and the excellent stability of inverted perovskite solar cells are promising for the eventual commercialization of perovskite optoelectronic devices.

Here, we introduce a sequential vapor-processing route based on physical vacuum evaporation of a PbCl2 layer followed by chemical reaction with methyl-ammonium iodide vapor. The demonstrated vapor-grown perovskite layers show compact, pinhole-free, and uniform microstructure with the average grain size of similar to 320 nm. Planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells are fabricated using TiO2 and spiro-OMeTAD charge transporting layers in regular n-i-p form. The devices exhibit the best efficiency of 11.5% with small deviation indicating the high uniformity and reproducibility of the perovskite layers formed by this route.

Here, we find that the introduction of bromide into formamidinium tin iodide (CH(NH2)(2)SnI3, FASnI(3)) lattice significantly lowers the carrier density of perovskite absorber, which is thought to be a result of reduction of Sn vacancies. It reduces the leakage current of devices, increases recombination lifetime, and finally improves open-circuit voltage and fill factor of the resulting devices employing mesoporous TiO2 as an electron transport layer. Consequently, a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.5% is achieved with an average PCE of 5%, and after encapsulation the devices are highly stable over 1000 h under continuous one sun illumination including the ultraviolet region. This study suggests a simple approach for improving stability and efficiency in FASnI(3)-based PSCs.

The film morphology, crystal structure, steady-state photoluminescence intensity, and photoluminescence lifetime of CsPbBr3 and MAPbBr(3) polycrystalline films were measured after thermal annealing at temperatures from 70 degrees C to 230 degrees C. The CsPbBr3 films exhibited little change in their structural and luminescent properties after being annealed even at 230 degrees C, whereas the MAPbBr(3) films exhibited a significant change in such properties due to their decomposition into PbBr2 when annealed at >= 180 degrees C. This study increased the understanding of the difference in the thermal stability of MHP polycrystalline films with different A-site cations.

In addition to the high charge mobility, the high absorption coefficient, and IR-blind characteristics of the perovskite material, the defect-tolerant nature of -CsPbI3 perovskite NCs are combined to realize hysteresis-free and high detectivity photodiodes. To further minimize interface defects originating from multi-layer photodiode construction, a poly(3-hexylthiophene) layer is strategically introduced as a passivation and electron blocking layer, resulting in a low diode ideality factor of 1.5 and a noise equivalent power of 1.6 x 10(-13) W Hz(-0.5). As a result, high detectivity of 1.8 x 10(12) Jones is demonstrated with near-zero hysteresis. Furthermore, the optimized photodiode exhibits excellent stability under high humidity conditions owing to the intrinsic nature of the defect-tolerant -CsPbI3 perovskite NCs.

GAPb(SCN)(3) exhibits an orthorhombic crystal phase, with optical band gap of 1.43 eV. The orthorhombic crystal phase shifted to a cubic phase, due to the formation of PbS beyond 150 degrees C. GAPb(SCN)(3) itself showed excellent stability upon being exposed to ambient conditions for 30 days, without degradation of its optical or crystallographic properties. This superior stability could be attributable to the strong electrostatic interaction between SCN- and Pb2+, and hydrogen bonding between SCN- and GA(+). Even though it has a suitable band gap, it exhibited a significantly lower efficiency of ca. 0.11%. The very low performance could be attributable to the significantly low light absorption coefficient, and large non-radiative recombination of photo-induced charges via an oxidized form of S at the TiO2/perovskite interface.

The device configuration is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3 PbIxCl3-x/PC60BM/Zr-TiOx/Al. The use of Zr-TiOx in the perovskite photodetector reduces the leakage current and improves carrier extraction. The performance of the perovskite photodetector was confirmed by analyzing the current-voltage characteristics, impedance behaviors, and dynamic characteristics. The device with a Zr-TiOx layer has a high specific detectivity of 1.37 x 10(13) Jones and a bandwidth of 2.1 MHz at a relatively low reverse bias and light intensity. Therefore, it can be effectively applied to devices such as image and optical sensors.	[Ji, C. H.; Kim, K. T.; Oh, S. Y.] Sogang Univ, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Seoul, South Korea[Ji, C. H.; Kim, K.
