The hydroxamic anchored dyes, PTZ-HA and BTPA-HA have shown enhanced efficiency of 4.06 and 6.22 % when compared to cyanaoacetic acid dyes, PTZ-CA and BTPA-CA showing 2.99 and 5.65 % efficiencies, respectively. This particular enhancement in the efficiencies could be attributed to the stable bidentate keto anchoring mode of the hydroxamic acid group, which led to the efficient electron injection. The detailed optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties were analyzed and complimented with the density functional theory (DFT) studies.

Although this material has been extensively studied as a semiconductor electrode for dye-sensitized solar cells for its inherent bandgap and its excellent electrical and chemical properties, the photoelectric efficiency is nevertheless lower than that of the Si-based solar cells, which is generally reported as 13-27%. On the other hand, various carbon structures have been studied to increase the overall charge transport efficiency by reducing the charge transport resistance in the cell while having high electric conductivity. These results are expected to improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency when applied to dye-sensitized solar cells. We fabricated a TiO2/multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) core-shell structure by a hydrothermal method. The TiO2 anatase phase in the TiO2/MWCNT core-shell structure was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The core shell nanostructure with a diameter of 127 nm to 211 nm was observed by field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). The morphology of the TiO2/MWCNT core shell nanocomposite was also analyzed by transmission electron microscope (TEM). The Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FT-IR) and Brunauer Emmett and Teller (BET) method were used to observe the chemical bonding and specific surface area of the TiO2/MWCNT core shell nanocomposite, respectively. The TiO2/MWCNT core-shell composites had a larger specific surface area of 92.00 m(2)/g, a larger pore volume of 0.33 cm(3)/g, and a larger pore size of 65.21 nm than commercial TiO2 nanoparticles (P25). The TiO2/MWCNT core-shell structure may provide a high-speed path for photoelectrons to pass quickly and will be useful for various applications, such as solar cells and photocatalysts.

The Pt-coated TE element provides electrons to the iodide/triiodide electrolyte to lower the redox barrier. This promotes the reduction of triiodide, resulting in a dramatic increase in the electron recombination lifetime. The available charge density, carrier diffusion coefficient and effective diffusion length were significantly increased when utilizing both types of carriers and acceleration in an iodide/triiodide reduction reaction in the unified DS-TEG.

When those nanoscale MAPbI(x)Br(3-x) perovskites were incorporated as a photosensitizer in typical solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (ss-DSSCs), it could be verified clearly by the capacitance analysis that nano-particulate MAPbI(3) perovskites play the same role as that of a typical dye sensitizer (MK-2 molecule) although their size, composition, and structure are different.

Compared with conventional TiO2 nanoparticles, the spherical assemblies consisting of low-dimensional nanocrystallites present significant advantages in terms of structural isotropy, monodisperse nature, structural diversity on nano- and (sub)micro-scales, structural stability, light harvesting property, interconnected nanobuilding blocks with less grain boundary, and easy reclaim. Superior performances have been demonstrated in the fields of photoelectrocatalysis and photovoltaics. Research efforts have been devoted to the rational design of a synthetic strategy for the facile preparation of nanoporous TiO2 spheres. The last decade has witnessed rapid progress in developing a synthesis strategy of nanoporous TiO2 spheres for optimal photochemical applications. Both chemical and physical routes have been extensively developed aiming to ease control over the self-assembly of nanobuilding blocks and, thus, the resultant textural properties and physicochemical performances of the nanoporous TiO2 spheres. In this review, a comprehensive description of different synthetic strategies is first presented, with a special emphasis on the formation mechanism, in particular, the pathway followed by nanocrystallites to self-assemble into a spherical structure. Notable experimental parameters are also discussed for the reproducible and controllable preparation of nanoporous TiO2 spheres with well-defined hierarchical structure, tunable porous microstructure from assembled nanobuilding blocks, and optimal physicochemical properties. Important applications in environmental photocatalysis, solar fuel synthesis, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), and perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are summarized, and the synthesis-component-structure-property relationship in nanoporous TiO2 spheres is highlighted. Finally, perspectives in this rapidly developing field are offered.

However, owing to its two-dimensional sheets like structure, there is re-stacking of rGO sheets, which reduces exposed surface area and hinders in electrolyte diffusion. To avoid these issues, activated charcoal (AC) is explored as an active spacer material between rGO sheets, for the first time. By loading an optimum concentration of AC in rGO, a high porosity, high conductivity, and high concentration of active sites were gathered in the single composite structure. Such synchronized features of the proposed composite were utilized for Pt-free counter electrode application in dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSc). The composite structure showed high electrocatalytic activity, with a low charge transfer resistance of 0.7 Omega, which is far lower than Pt and rGO (8.5 Omega and 7.5 Omega). The DSSc fabricated with optimized composite showed power conversion efficiency of 8.6%, compared to Pt-based DSSc with 7.9% efficiency. Additionally, the potential of the electrode was also tested for the electro-photocatalytic (99%) degradation of methylene blue dye from water, in 60 min.

To improve the efficiency of the electron transfer the conventional structure of the working electrode (WE) based on TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) was replaced with TiO2 nanotubes (NTs). Sol-gel method was used to prepare undoped and Nb-doped TiO2 NPs and TiO2 NTs. The crystallinity and morphology of the WEs were characterized using XRD, SEM and TEM techniques. XPS and PL measurements revealed a higher concentration of oxygen-related defects at the surface of NPs-based electrodes compared to that based on NTs. Replacement of the conventional NPs-based TiO2 WE with alternative led to a 15% increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the DSCs. The effect is attributed to the more efficient transfer of charge carriers in the NTs-based electrodes due to lower defect concentration. The suggestion was confirmed experimentally by electrical impedance spectroscopy measurements when we observed the higher recombination resistance at the TiO2 NTs-electrolyte interface compared to that at the TiO2 NPs-electrolyte interface. Moreover, Nb-doping of the TiO2 structures yields an additional 14% PCE increase. The application of Nb-doped TiO2 NTs as photo-electrode enables the fabrication of a DSC with an efficiency of 8.1%, which is 35% higher than that of a cell using a TiO2 NPs. Finally, NTs-based DSCs have demonstrated a 65% increase in the PCE value, when light intensity was decreased from 1000 to 10 W/m(2) making such kind device be promising alternative indoor PV applications when the intensity of incident light is low.

In this study, Ru-N-doped template-free mesoporous carbon (Ru-N-TMC) was prepared by the direct stabilization and carbonization of the poly(butyl acrylate)-b-polyacrylonitrile (PBA-b-PAN) block copolymer and ruthenium(iii) acetylacetonate [Ru(acac)(3)]. During the stabilization process, microphase separation occurred in the PBA-b-PAN block copolymer due to the incompatibility between the two blocks, and the PAN block transformed to N-doped semi-graphitic carbon. In the carbonization step, the PBA block was eliminated as a porous template, creating hierarchal mesopores/micropores. Meanwhile, Ru(acac)(3) was decomposed to Ru, which was homogeneously distributed over the carbon substrate and anchored through N and O heteroatoms. The resulting Ru-N-TMC showed ultra-low charge transfer resistance (R-ct = 0.034 omega cm(2)) in the Co(bipyridine)(3)(3+/2+) reduction reaction, indicating very high electrocatalytic ability. Even though it is a transparent counter electrode (CE, average visible transmittance of 42.25%), covering a small fraction of the fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO)/glass substrate with Ru-N-TMC, it led to lower charge transfer resistance (R-ct = 0.55 omega cm(2)) compared to Pt (R-ct = 1.00 omega cm(2)). The Ru-N-TMC counter electrode exhibited a superior power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.42% compared to Pt (11.16%) when employed in SGT-021/Co(bpy)(3)(3+/2+) based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Furthermore, a remarkable PCE of 10.13% and 8.64% from front and rear illumination, respectively, was obtained when the Ru-N-TMC counter electrode was employed in a bifacial DSSC. The outstanding catalytic activity and PCE of Ru-N-TMC were due to the high surface area of Ru-N-TMC, which contained numerous active species (Ru and N), easily facilitated to redox ions through the hierarchical microporous/mesoporous structure.

A transparent counter electrode (CE) was prepared using tellurium-doped, mesoporous carbon (TeMC) materials, and was directly applied to bifacial, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). To improve the performance of the bifacial DSSC device, CEs should have outstanding electrocatalytic activity, electrical conductivity, and electrochemical stability, as well as high transparency. In this study, to make transparent electrodes with outstanding electrocatalytic activity and electrical conductivity, various TeMC materials with different carbonization temperatures were prepared by simple pyrolysis of the polyacrylonitrile-block-poly (n-butyl acrylate) (PAN-b-PBA) block copolymer in the presence of the tellurium metalloid. The electrocatalytic activity of the prepared TeMC materials were evaluated through a dummy cell test, and the material with the best catalytic ability was selected and optimized for application in bifacial DSSC devices by controlling the film thickness of the CE. As a result, the bifacial DSSC devices with the TeMC CE exhibited high power conversion efficiencies (PCE), i.e., 9.43% and 8.06% under front and rear side irradiation, respectively, which are the highest values reported for bifacial DSSCs to date. Based on these results, newly-developed transparent, carbon-based electrodes may lead to more stable and effective bifacial DSSC development without sacrificing the photovoltaic performance of the DSSC device.

However, mostly, MoS2 CEs for DSSCs are prepared by conventional chemical reactions and annealing at a high temperature. By these conventional processes, deposition of sufficiently thin and transparent MoS2 layers is challenging; therefore, bifacial DSSCs employing transparent MoS2 CEs have not been studied. Here, we report transparent few-nanometer-thick MoS2 CEs prepared by atomic layer deposition at a relatively low temperature (98 degrees C) for bifacial DSSC applications. MoS2 nanofilms with precisely controlled thicknesses of 3-16 nm are conformally coated on transparent conducting oxide glass substrates. With increase in the MoS2 nanofilm thickness, the MoS2 CE electrocatalytic activity for the iodide/triiodide redox couple enhances, but its transparency decreases. Notably, the application of a thinner MoS2 nanofilm in a bifacial DSSC leads to lower conversion efficiency under front-illumination, but higher conversion efficiency under back-illumination. In particular, only the 3 nm-thick MoS2 nanofilm shows reasonable photovoltaic performances under both front- and back-illumination conditions.

Effective Preparation of Nanoscale CH3NH3PbI3 Perovskite Photosensitizers for Mesoporous TiO2-Based Solar Cells by Successive Precursor Layer Adsorption and Reaction Process	ENERGY TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						nanoscale perovskites; photosensitizers; solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells; successive adsorption and reaction	HALIDE PEROVSKITE; GAME-CHANGER; EFFICIENCY; FILMS; PBI2; RECOMBINATION; SENSITIZERS; STABILITY; PBS	Nanoscale CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite sensitizers are grown by delivering each precursor successively onto the surface of mesoporous (meso) TiO2 electrodes. Using Pb(NO3)(2) ions as a lead(II) source and CH3NH3I (MAI) for methylammonium and iodide sources, repetitive cycles of the two dipping steps are successful in growing few nanometer-sized MAPbI(3) gradually on the TiO2 surface inside the meso-TiO2 film. However, some aggregates are observed on the top surface of the meso-TiO2 film due to slight dissolution of PbI2 and its accumulation/reaction with MAI at the top surface of the meso-TiO2 film. To solve this inhomogeneity of the deposition, a nondestructive multiple deposition route for nanoscale MAPbI(3) is suggested as a successive precursor layer adsorption and reaction (SPLAR) process where, from the second cycle of deposition, PbI2 is delivered with the help of an ionic liquid compound dissolved in dichloromethane. With this new Pb precursor in less-polar solvents, nanoscale MAPbI(3) sensitizers are grown without dissolution of preformed perovskites or formation of some aggregates at the top surface. After the third cycle of SPLAR deposition, about 7.0 nm-sized MAPbI(3) sensitizers are prepared and display enhanced photovoltaic performance (7.18 +/- 0.31%) compared with devices obtained from only one cycle (5.74 +/- 0.30%).

With this objective, two CE films PPy + SDS (polypyrrole + sodium dodecyl sulfate as a surfactant), and PPy + SDS + CNT (carbon nanotubes) were prepared by a simple electrochemical polymerization method. These films were effectively used as the CE in DSSCs and ss-DSSCs. Tafel curves and impedance spectroscopy data showed that the PPy + SDS + CNT has a low surface resistance, which causes excellent electrocatalytic activity in both devices. DSSCs with a PPy + SDS + CNT CE show good power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared to ss-DSSCs. Both devices show comparable PEC to the Pt counterpart, and the PPy + SDS + CNT film can be used as a CE for DSSCs and ss-DSSCs and is a viable alternative to a sputtered Pt electrode.

Although the ubiquitous combination of the I-/I-3(-) redox couple demonstrates high power conversion efficiency (PCE), it suffers from several limitations such as a large potential difference of approximately 560 mV between the Fermi level of I-/I-3(-) and the HOMO level of the N719 dye as well as high visible light absorption. These limitations cause inefficient dye-regeneration and significantly enhance the back reaction rate of photoelectrons to I-3(-) in the electrolyte. This review discusses recent progress in the conception and device performance of different binary redox couples in DSSCs based on lowering potential differences, the back reaction of photo-induced electrons, the absorption of visible light, and improvement of dye regeneration. We specifically focus on recent strategies targeted for effectively increasing both the open circuit voltage of DSSCs up to (similar to)100 mV and the PCE to above 10%; these strategies include introduction of binary redox couples or additional redox species to conventional iodine-based electrolytes. Moreover, we propose future directions for the further development of binary redox couples with advanced concepts for achieving DSSCs with high performance and high stability.

Impedance spectroscopy (IS) has been key to characterizing photovoltaic devices; however, its application to PSCs has generated misleading outputs. In this work, we control the precursor concentrations to fabricate a series of PSCs with different amounts of perovskite absorber. While lower concentration devices present the well-known dye-sensitized impedance pattern, the characteristic impedance spectrum of thin-film PSCs arises for higher concentrations. The capacitances' evolution is employed to identify the dominant physical processes in the spectrum and reveals that it is not possible to assign a single physical origin to each individual feature. On the contrary, their resistances present contributions from different physical processes, including charge transport and recombination. We provide an equivalent circuit to evaluate the IS of PSCs in terms of the processes directly affecting their performance, a tool for further development of perovskite photovoltaics.

The synthesized metal-free organic co-sensitizers were employed for cocktail dye-sensitized solar cells along with N749 (black dye). The DSSC devices with a mixture of co-sensitizers (CSGR1-5) and N749 have shown a 7.95%, 8.40%, 7.81%, 6.56% and 6.99% power conversion efficiency (PCE) respectively, which was more than that of single N749 dye PCE (6.18%). Enhanced efficiency could be ascribed to the increased short circuit current (J(sc)) and open circuit voltage (V-oc). The increased J(sc) was achieved due to enhanced light harvesting nature of N749 device upon co-sensitization with CSGR dyes and feasible energy levels of both the dyes. The V-oc was improved due to better surface coverage which helps in decreasing the rate of recombination. The detailed optical and electrochemical properties were investigated and complimented with theoretical studies (DFT).

Pt nanoparticles or fac-[Re(4,4'-bis-(diethoxyphosphorylmethyl)-2,2'-bipyridine)(CO)(3)Cl] were used as each catalytic center within the DSC frame of SQ/TiO2/Pt (Type I) or SQ/TiO2/Re(I) (Type II). In order to convey the potential utility of SQ in low energy sensitization, the following catalytic reductions were carried out under selective lower energy irradiation (>500 nm). Type I and II showed different catalytic performances, primarily due to the choice of solvent for each catalytic condition: hydrogenation was carried out in H2O, but CO2 reduction in dimethylforma- mide (DMF), and SQ was more stable in aqueous acid conditions for hydrogen generation than CO2 reduction in DMF. A suspension of Type I in 3 mL water containing 0.1 M ascorbic acid (pH = 2.66) resulted in efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, producing 37 mu mol of H-2 for 4 h. However, in photocatalysis of Type II (SQ/TiO2/Re(I)) in 3 mL DMF containing 0.1 M 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-1,3-dihydrobenzimidazole, the TiO2-bound SQ dyes were not capable of working as a low energy sensitizer because SQ was susceptible to dye decomposition in nucleophilic DMF conditions, resulting in DSC deactivation for the CO(2 )reduction. Even with the limitation of solvent, the DSC conditions for the utility of SQ have been established: the anchoring group effect of SQ with either phosphonic acid or carboxylic acid onto the TiO2 surface; energy alignment of SQ with the flat band potentials (E-fb) of TiO2 semiconductors and the reduction power of electron donors; and the wavelength range of the light source used, particularly when >500 nm.

The formation of CoSe2@RGO composites was identified by analysis with X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Electrochemical analyses demonstrated that the CoSe2@RGO composites have excellent catalytic activity for the reduction of I-3(-), possibly indicating a synergetic effect of CoSe2 and RGO. As a consequence, the CoSe2@RGO composites were applied as a counter electrode in DSSC for the reduction of redox couple electrolyte, and exhibiting the comparable power conversion efficiency (7.01%) to the rare metal platinum (Pt) based photovoltaic device (6.77%).

The solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell (ss-DSSC) has been instigated to overcome the liquid-DSSC's inherent production and instability issues and advancement has been made to achieve low-cost high-power conversion efficiency. The photovoltaic performance of ruthenium-based complex Z907 dye was studied in ss-DSSCs using a solid-state polymerized conductive polymer as hole-transporting material (HTM). We investigated the long-term stability of both liquid and solid-state DSSCs and the findings revealed an improved photovoltaic performance and long-term stability of ss-DSSC. This mainly depends on the transport phenomena of the HTM throughout the interface. The present results show a pavement for manufacturing highly stable and inexpensive ss-DSSC and the practical use is promising.

The modified acceptor units of the new dyes rendered stronger electron withdrawing ability which resulted in better charge transfer and light harvesting properties with reference to SM315. The acceptor design of K-04 dye, composed of benzothiadiazole and 4-(cyanomethyl)benzoic acid, is the most successful in improving the charge transfer property, evidenced by the highest amount of transferred charge (q(CT)), charge transfer distance (D-CT), and variation of dipole moment (mu(CT)), and the most bathochromically shifted broad Q-band with enhanced molar extinction coefficient. For quantitative estimation of the light harvesting ability of the dyes, the LHE curve and J(sc)(max) were calculated revealing that K-04 dye is the best light harvester among the dyes with varied acceptor unit. Moreover, the highest dipole moment of the dye-TiO2 complex (mu(dye-TiO2)) and largest spatial separation distance (r) between the TiO2 surface and hole centroid of K-04 dye estimates its highest V-oc, within the group. With respect to K-04, changing the donor group to 9,9-dimethyl-10-phenyl-9,10-dihydroacridine, a semi-rigid triphenylamine (tPA) donor named as D1, resulted in a significant bathochromic shift of the Q-band with a remarkably high molar extinction coefficient. Among the derivatives of D1, the D4 donor group functionalized with diphenylamine enforced the push-pull character resulting in the most favorable CT properties and LHE of K-44 dye. These properties, along with the highest J(sc)(max), and largest mu(dye)-TiO2 and r, made K-44 dye the most promising candidate in this series.

Other than higher efficiency, EDS is highly promising for increasing the stability of Dye-Sensitized Solar cells (DSSC); as it decreases the UV degradation of the cell. Previously, heavy metals-based (Cadmium etc) quantum dots are used for the purpose, which are not only toxic but also have less stability and have complicated synthesis methods. To overcome these issues, a thin coating of green emissive Nitrogen-doped Carbon Quantum Dots (N-CQDs) on DSSC, as a stable and efficient EDS layer is proposed here. N-CQDs were synthesized by a scalable, green and facile one-pot hydrothermal pyrolysis of citric acid in presence of nitrogen source, with a production yield of 65%, and quantum yield of 70%. The readily dispersible and highly stable colloid of N-CQDs was coated on the device, and with an optimized thickness, the power conversion efficiency was increased by 10%. This increase was further confirmed by external quantum efficiency (EQE) test, i.e. N-CQDs coated device showed EQE enhancement majorly in the UV spectrum and enhanced stability in UV light was recorded. The transmittance of FTO-glass was increased due to EDS and it also has an antireflection effect, which intern produces a small increase in EQE in the visible spectrum.

Output current enhancement of hexylthiophene functionalized D-pi-extended-A triphenylamine in dye sensitized solar cells	NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article							ELECTRON-TRANSFER MEDIATORS; ORGANIC-DYES; IMPEDANCE SPECTROSCOPY; REDOX ELECTROLYTE; ENERGY-LEVELS; PERFORMANCE; EFFICIENT; RECOMBINATION; CONVERSION; COMPLEXES	In this work, we report the synthesis of triphenylamine based D-pi-extended-A hexylthiophene functionalized MY-102 dye and its solar power conversion efficiency improvement in dye sensitized solar cells (DSCs). This dye was synthesized by Wittig, Suzuki and Sonogashira coupling reactions. The synthesized dye shows higher absorption wavelength and molar extinction coefficient (480 nm and 42 375 M-1 cm(-1)) compared to those of the reference TA-St-CA dye (469 nm and 21 803 M-1 cm(-1)). DFT and TD-DFT calculations of MY-102 dye show that the LUMO level of the dye lies closer to the conduction band (CB) edge of TiO2. A power conversion efficiency of 5.07% is achieved by fabricating the solar cell with the conventional I-3(-)/I- electrolyte compared to 4.26% obtained with the reference TA-St-CA dye. MY-102 dye fabricated with the Co(phen)(3)(2+) electrolyte shows an improvement in power conversion efficiency due to the increased V-OC. The I-3(-)/I- electrolyte with a redox potential of 0.35 V is located at a much higher energy region compared to the HOMO level of MY-102 and near the conduction band edge of TiO2. This limits both electron transfer to MY-102 and electron acceptance from TiO2, affecting the V-OC and results in poor conversion efficiency. On the other hand, the Co(phen)(3)(2+) electrolyte with a redox potential of 0.62 V is located near the HOMO level of MY-102 and below the conduction band edge of TiO2, which facilitates the efficient electron transfer and acceptance. This contributes to the V-OC of MY-102 dye and results in an outstanding conversion efficiency of 6.62%.	[Joseph, K. L.

Furtheremore, the electron lifetime in photoanodes is significantly enhanced due to the ZnO shell, which is examined by open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurement. Photocurrent density-voltage (J-V) curves under the dark condition and OCVD spectra reveal that a negative shift in TiO2 conduction band potential and an energy barrier effect owing to the ZnO shell concurrently contribute to the enhancement of V-OC and electron lifetime.

However, the working mechanism of the Li-TFSI dopant is a long-standing question. The hygroscopicity of Li-TFSI makes it difficult to isolate the exact doping mechanism. In this study, we unveil the role of Li-TFSI in the p-doping to the N,N'-di(1-naphthyl)-N,N'-diphenyl-(1,1'-biphenyl)-4,4'-diamine (NPB) HTL. A series of systematic in situ measurements using ultraviolet and inverse photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that electron transfer from NPB to Li-TFSI occurs due to the lower-lying negative polaronic level of Li-TFSI rather than the positive polaronic level of NPB. The hole injection barrier between NPB and indium tin oxide is significantly reduced with Li-TFSI doping, enhancing the device performance of hole-only devices and organic light-emitting diodes dramatically. With excessive dopants, however, the agglomerative property of Li-TFSI became dominant, decreasing the doping efficiency. These results provide robust guidelines for developing an efficient doping method for a molecular system with high conductivity.

The electrochemical behavior of the electrodeposited FTO/CoSe2 films is examined through Tafel polarization, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. The results indicate that the FTO/CoSe2 films exhibit outstanding electrocatalytic ability and electrochemical stability toward the I-/I-3(-) redox couple. The optimized FTO/CoSe2 film fully covers the FTO substrate and features a nanoporous structure of interconnecting nanocrystalline networks, which is beneficial for the diffusion of ions and provides numerous electrochemical active sites. The optimized DSSC using FTO/CoSe2 as CE exhibits a significantly improved cell efficiency of 7.95% compared to that of the DSSC using FTO/Pt as CE (7.48%). (c) 2019 The Electrochemical Society.

DSSCs are composed of a photosensitizing dye adsorbed on a mesoporous film of nanocrystalline TiO2 as a photoelectrode, an electrolyte containing triiodide/iodide redox couple, and a platinized counter electrode. To improve photovoltaic properties of DSSCs, new dicationic salts based on ionic liquids were synthesized.

Solution-processed nanocrystalline MoO3 and conducting polymerized dibromo-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) were mixed to develop a hybrid material, which was used in efficient solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (ssDSSCs) as an HTM. Nanocrystalline MoO3 was prepared by a low-temperature solution method, and the dibromo-EDOT was prepared from commercially available EDOT by a conventional bromination method. The incorporation of MoO3 into a hybrid HTM significantly improved the device efficiency owing to its high charge transport mechanism and suppression of the recombination in the ssDSSCs. Furthermore, we examined the influence of the blend ratio of MoO3 and dibromo-EDOT on the photovoltaic performance of the devices. Moreover, the ssDSSCs were characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Tafel polarization analysis to examine the charge transfer kinetics. The improved performance of the ssDSSCs could be attributed to increased charge carrier collection by the hybrid HTM. The photovoltaic results revealed that the device fabricated with a hybrid HTM containing 0.2 wt% MoO3 showed the best efficiency(.)

These FeS2 nanocrystals were used as a counter electrode (CE) alternative to the conventional Pt CE in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) owing to its tremendous optical properties and low-cost. The obtained FeS2 nanocrystalline materials with excellent shape and phase purity were confirmed through XRD and Raman spectroscopy data. From Tafel, and impedance spectroscopy studies, the catalytic activity FeS2 CEs are found to be comparable with that of Pt CE. Along with the I-3(-)/I- electrolyte, photo-conversion efficiency is found to be 6.9% (spherical), 6.2% (cubic) for the FeS2 CE, and 7% for Pt CE. The excellent performance of the FeS2 CE in DSSCs makes it a distinctive choice among the various CE materials studied including low-cost photovoltaics.

The electroctalytic activity of the CoS@FTO towards the I-3(-) to I- reduction exhibited almost similar electrocatalytic properties to the Pt-based counter electrode. The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) assembled with CoS@FTO counter electrode attained almost similar photovoltaic performance (5.64%) to that of the DSSC with Pt@FTO counter electrode (5.9%) under 1 sun illumination. The adhesion stability of the CoS deposited at FTO was also studied using strong adhesive tape test, and the results show that after the strong adhesive tape test, the CoS@FTO retained almost 95% of the coating. The similar and comparative performance of the CoS@FTO to the Pt@FTO may be due to the high surface area originating from the 3D flower-like morphology, and the excellent electrocatalytic activity of the CoS.

The synthesized zeolites were characterized by various surface analysis and used as quasi-solid-state electrolytes for dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Compared to nano-gel electrolytes based DSSCs showing almost 3.8% of cell efficiency, the enhanced cell efficiencies were obtained from zeolite-XF12 (6.0%), XF7 (5.0%) and X&A (4.8%), respectively. The enhanced performance by zeolite-XF12 was resulted from effective light harvesting properties of quasi-solid-state electrolyte, reduction of resistance at photoanode/electrolyte interface, and decrease in charge recombination.

Although the most efficient DSSCs and PSCs have been fabricated using TiO2 as the ETL, TiO2 exhibits inherently low electron mobility with difficulty controlling the energy levels (i.e., conduction and valence bands) as it possesses a single phase of two components. Here, we report the synthesis of Sr-substituted BaSnO3 (BSSO) by a low-temperature solution process as a new alternative to TiO2 for both PSCs and DSSCs. The energy-level tailoring by Sr incorporation into BaSnO3 minimizes the open-circuit voltage (V-OC) loss at the interfaces of ETL/perovskite and ETL/electrolyte in the PSCs and DSSCs, thereby leading to an improved V-OC from 0.65 to 0.72 V in DSSC and 1.07 to 1.13 V in PSCs. Additionally, the BSSO ETL-based PSC shows improved photostability compared to the TiO2 analog. Our results show that energy-level tuned BSSO can be applied as a universal ETL for improving efficiency in both PSCs and DSSCs.

The OrgD-vertical bar TiO2 vertical bar-MnP hybrid reveals persistent photocatalytic behavior, giving high turnover numbers and good product selectivity (HCOO- versus CO). As a typical run, visible-light irradiation of the hybrid catalyst in the presence of 0.1 M electron donor (ED) and 0.001 M LiCIO4 persistently produced HCOO- with a >99% selectivity accompanied by a trace amount of CO; the turnover number (TONformate) reached,similar to 250 after 23 h of irradiation. The product selectivity (HCOO-/CO) was found to be controlled by changing the loading amount of MnP on the TiO2 surface. In situ FTIR analysis of the hybrid during photocatalysis revealed that, at low Mn concentration, the Mn-H monomeric mechanism associated with HCOO- formation is dominant, whereas at high Mn concentration, CO is formed via a Mn-Mn dimer mechanism.

The potential sweep is between -0.9 V and 0.7 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) for 4-10 cycles. The series resistance is gradually reduced with increased Ni3S4 film thickness, indicating the metallic conduction of the Ni3S4 phase. The Ni3S4 deposited for 8 cycles (denoted FTO/Ni3S4-8) exhibits full coverage on the FTO substrate, with 110 nm thickness and a distinctive structure of porous and nanoscale interconnecting nanoparticular networks, which provide numerous electrochemical active sites to contact with electrolyte. The film not only exhibits prominent electrocatalytic activities but also shows excellent electrochemical stability in both polysulfide and iodide-based electrolytes compared to FTO/Pt. On the contrary, the FTO/Ni3S4-10 shows merged clusters, leading to more compact and less porous morphology, which reduced electrocatalytic activity. The quantum dot-sensitized solar cell (QD-SSC) fabricated using the FTO/Ni3S4-8 counter electrode (CE) exhibits power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.57%, short-circuit current (J(sc)) of 15.92 mA cm(-2), open-circuit voltage (V-oc) of 0.545 V, and fill factor (FF) of 52.63%. In addition, the dye-sensitized solar cell (D-SSC) using FTO/Ni3S4-8 CE achieves a PCE of 8.17%, J(sc) of 16.28 mA cm(-2), V-oc of 0.735 V, and FF of 6834%. On the other hand, the PCEs of 2.56% and 7.58% are obtained for QD-SSC and D-SSC with Pt CE, respectively. We suggest that the electrodeposited Ni3S4 should be promising electrocatalytic electrodes for various applications such as QD-SSCs, D-SSCs, supercapacitors, photoelectrochemical water-splitting cells, and batteries.

Herein, we synthesized four dyes with a D-pi-A configuration in order to study the variation produced in the optical, thermal, redox and photovoltaic properties by substitution of different donors and acceptors in the dipyrrolopyrazine (DPP) system. These push-pull systems are based on a pyrrolopyrazine spacer, end-capped with donors (N,N-dimethylamine, and thiophene) and acceptors (pyridine, -COOH, and -CN). The multidisciplinary study concerning the optical, thermal, redox, and photovoltaic characterization of the dyes reveals that compound 3a exhibits the best overall conversion efficiency as a sensitizer in TiO2 dye sensitized solar cells. The theoretical calculations together with experimental data allow us to quantify the charge transfer character of dyes.

MoSe2 was synthesized onto fluorine doped tin oxide substrates and could be directly used as a counter electrode (CE) for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The role of deposition time on the growth of MoSe2 CE was elaborately discussed using Raman, X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence studies. Influence of wet chemical growth time on the surface modification of MoSe2 CE was evidently demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy studies. The MoSe2 CE electrode has lower charge transfer resistance and superior electrocatalytic activity towards triiodide/iodide redox behavior, comparable to conventional Pt CEs. High power conversion efficiency of 7.28% was achieved, equivalent to scarce noble metal Pt CE (7.40%). Uniform surface morphology with active edge sites highly dominated to promote the superior electrocatalytic activity. This work opens a way to use an economical wet chemical method to fabricate the layered MoSe2 CE as a replacement for high cost Pt based CE for DSSCs.

However, the charge transfer kinetics mediated by its surface state remains unclear. Here, the charge transfer mechanism of Cs2SnI6 is reported and the role of its surface state in the presence of a redox mediator is clarified. Specifically, charge transfer through the surface state of Cs2SnI6 and its subsequent surface state charging are demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry and Mott-Schottky measurements, respectively. Because it is expected that the surface state of Cs2SnI6 is capable of regenerating oxidized organic dyes, a Cs2SnI6-based regenerator is developed for a dye-sensitized solar cell composed of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/dyed mesoporous TiO2/regenerator/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/FTO. As expected, the performance of the Cs2SnI6-based regenerator is strongly dependent on the highest occupied molecular orbital of the dyes. Consequently, Cs2SnI6 shows efficient charge transfer with a thermodynamically favorable charge acceptor level, achieving a 79% enhancement in the photocurrent density (14.1 mA cm(-2)) compared with that of a conventional liquid electrolyte (7.9 mA cm(-2)). The results suggest that the surface state of Cs2SnI6 is the main charge transfer pathway in the presence of a redox mediator and should be considered in future designs of Cs2SnI6-based devices.

The carboxylated 1,3-indanedione sensitizers have shown almost 100 nm enhanced absorption curves compared to the cyanoacetic acid dyes with an extended IPCE curve up to 800 nm. Despite greater absorption and electrochemical properties, the synthesized dyes showed moderate efficiencies (2.10% and 2.67%) than standard dyes. The low electron injection efficiency and recombination of carboxylated 1,3-indanedione might be responsible for low efficiency. Detailed investigation studies have been performed and complemented with the theoretical studies.	[Jeong, Hyeonjun; Kim, Dong Woo; Vattikuti, S. V.

J	Bao, LQ; Thogiti, S; Koyyada, G; Kim, JH				Bao, Le Quoc; Thogiti, Suresh; Koyyada, Ganesh; Kim, Jae Hong			Synthesis and photovoltaic performance of novel ullazine-based organic dyes for dye-sensitized solar cells	JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL THERMOCHEMISTRY; AB-INITIO; TRIPHENYLAMINE; PHENANTHRENES; HETEROARENES; MOLECULES; CONTINUUM; ACCEPTOR; DESIGN	Two new ullazine-based organic dyes have been synthesized for applications in nanocrystalline TiO2 -based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Overall conversion efficiencies up to 3.63% were obtained for DSSCs based on these dyes. The dye with a tert-butyl antenna exhibited a higher and redshifted absorption pattern resulting in increased light-harvesting property. Compared to the unsubstituted dye, the photocurrent density, open-circuit photovoltage and overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells based on the tert-butyl substituted dye are improved. The decreased PCE of the solar cell based on unsubstituted dye results mainly from the increased recombination rate and decreased electron lifetime, as evidenced from impedance and photovoltage decay measurements. Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT calculations were performed to predict the geometries, electronic structure, and the optical and electrochemical properties of the dyes.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and Tafel curves verified that the unique structure is beneficial for improving the catalytic activity for the reduction of triiodide to iodide and a low charge transfer resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The thicknesses of the top and bottom layers of WS2/MoTe2 were varied to achieve high DSSC performance. Consequently, DSSCs assembled with the optimized WS2/MoTe2 CE reached a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.99%, which is comparable to the conventional Pt CE (8.50%) and their pristine WS2 and MoTe2 CEs (6.3% and 7.25%, respectively). Our findings create a way to prepare DSSCs with efficient performance.

Nevertheless, utilization of liquid electrolyte in DSSCs brings practical problems for commercialization, which leads to solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (ssDSSCs), that based on organic conducting polymers or inorganic p-type semiconductors as hole transport materials (HTM). A one-side ssDSSCs fabricated here, with a conductive polymer Dibromo-EDOT as an HTM, and also check ssDSSCs efficiency by variation of the HTM concentrations. The morphology of cells examined through SEM, and intensity-modulated photocurrent/voltage spectroscopy, measurements were used to elucidating the electrochemical properties of ssDSSCs. We also optimize the blocking layer thickness and different molar ratios of HTM for the best efficient ssDSSCs.

The 5-methylthio-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-thiol/5-methylthio-1,3,4-thiadiazolium disulfide dication redox couple is low-cost and easily processable, and exhibits nonabsorption of visible light, showing improved redox behavior at an electrochemically deposited poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) counter electrode. Its redox potential is ca. 60 mV negatively and ca. 170 mV (vs. normal hydrogen electrode) positively positioned than those of iodide/tri-iodide and polysulfide electrolytes, respectively. The maximum power conversion efficiency of (3.55 and 1.20) % is obtained in dye and quantum-dot sensitized solar cells, respectively, sensitized by 5-[[4-[4-(2, 2-Diphenylethenyl) phenyl]-1,2,3,3a,4,8b hexahydrocyclopent [b] indol-7-yl] methylene] 2 (3 octyl-4-oxo-2-thioxo-5-thiazolid dye and CdS-quantum dot, respectively, together with the optimized poly(3,4ethylenedioxythiophene) counter electrode. These results clearly outperform the performance of identical dye and quantum-dot sensitized solar cells with Pt and Cu2S-counter electrodes. Thus, this new redox couple and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) counter electrode pair is expected to offer a promising and universal alternative to the conventional iodide/tri-iodide and polysulfide electrolytes for sensitization-based solar cells.

The effects of the Ce precursor on the hydrothermal synthesis of ZnO nanowires were investigated as a function of the Ce concentration. It was found that all the samples exhibited preferential orientation toward the c-plane and the Ce precursor had no effect on the lattice constant in the ZnO nanowires. ZnO nanowires grown in solutions containing 1 and 2 at % Ce precursors were bent and bundled, suggesting that solutions containing adequate amounts of Ce precursors enable the top surfaces of the vertically aligned ZnO nanowires to be either positively or negatively charged, and that electrostatic interactions among these local charges causes bending and bundling of the ZnO nanowires. Thus, Ce precursors in the solutions can control the morphology of the ZnO nanowires, causing them to be bent and bundled. We suggest that the bundled ZnO is applicable to Dye-sensitized solar cells because it can be enhanced adsorbed dye amounts in devices.

The CeO2:Gd nanoparticle-based DSSC showed a photoconversion efficiency of 8.03% with an improvement of 45% compared to that of the conventional TiO2 nanoparticle-based DSSC due to the increased diffuse reflectance of visible light. The TiO2/CeO2:Gd photoanode had higher charge transfer resistance than conventional TiO2 nanoparticlebased photoanode. It is suggested that the improvement in the conversion efficiency results from the enhanced highly favored light scattering and downconversion photoluminescence of the CeO2:Gd nanoparticles.

Here, we demonstrate a highly efficient and highly semitransparent LSC-PVs capable of harvesting dual wavelength bands. We used a triplet-triplet annihilation-based photon upconversion (UC) LSC that luminesce high energy green light by absorbing low energy red light, as well as downshift LSC that luminesce green light by absorbing ultraviolet light. The luminescent light concentrated from the two LSCs is absorbed by a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) having a high extinction coefficient at this wavelength. Our optimized dual band LS-CPV exhibited 27% higher power conversion efficiency than the LSC-PV that absorb a single wavelength band. With respect to practical applications, the dual band LSC-DSSCs were fabricated in the form of an LSC window-DSSC window frame. We achieved a power conversion efficiency of 9.1% per LSC panel area. This dual-band LSC-DSSC exhibited high stability and maintained efficiency even at oblique illumination. Our results will be promising as an aesthetic and energy independent next generation BIPV.

J	Lee, HM; Yoon, JH				Lee, Hyo Mun; Yoon, Jong Ho			Power performance analysis of a transparent DSSC BIPV window based on 2 year measurement data in a full-scale mock-up	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV); Dye-sensitized Solar Cell (DSSC); Full scale mock-up; Measured power performance; Power generation characteristics	SENSITIZED SOLAR-CELLS; LIGHT-SCATTERING; EFFICIENCY; LAYER; OPTIMIZATION; ELECTRODES; FILMS; DYES	Among transparent solar cells or modules, the DSSC (Dye-sensitized solar cell) has a relatively low production cost compared to silicon-based solar cells and provides a range of colors for building design. On the other hand, its commercialization has been limited by the low power generation efficiency and durability. Few studies have examined the power generation performance of a full scale DSSC module applied to actual buildings. In this study, a long-term performance test was conducted on vertical and inclined DSSC BIPV (Building Integrated Photovoltaic) windows applied to a full-scale mock-up facility to verify the power performance and power characteristics of transparent DSSC BIPV glazing under actual conditions over a 2 year period. The DSSC module was fabricated by the serial connection of nine 2.26Wp transparent DSSC sub-modules. The multi-layered DSSC BIPV glazing, which was composed of a "DSSC module (9mm)" + "air space (12 mm)" + "clear glass (5mm)" was joined to the curtain wall frame of the test cell facility. The unit size of the DSSC BIPV glazing was 0.975 m (W) x 0.965 m (H) and its maximum capacity was 20.34Wp. The size of the test cell facility was 3 m (W) x 3 m (H) x 9 m (D). The building is a container type insulated with 100 mm urethane foam. Four and two DSSC BIPV windows were installed on the vertical south wall and on the 30 degrees sloped roof, respectively. Through the monitoring system, the power performance data of each DSSC BIPV windows and meteorological data were analyzed over a two year period (from 1st Jan. 2015 to 31st Dec 2016). The 2 year data showed that the average daily power yield for each month of the vertical DSSC BIPV window ranged from 1.75 to 3.93 kWh/kWp day (average 2.53 kWh/kWp day), whereas that of the 30 degrees sloped DSSC BIPV window ranged from 2.16 to 5.34 kWh/kWp day (average 3.60 kWh/kWp day). The operating power efficiency of the vertical DSSC BIPV window ranged from 2.65 to 4.14% with an average of 3.40%, whereas that of the sloped DSSC BIPV window was in the range of 2.64-3.63% with a mean of 3.01%. The power generation efficiency of the vertical plane BIPV window was higher than the sloped BIPV window. In contrast to the average daily power yield, the power efficiency of the vertical window was higher than that of the sloped window, which may be due to the higher efficiency of the DSSCs under overcast conditions. This is consistent with the power performance of the DSSC BIPV windows according to the sky conditions, which showed an increase in power efficiency with increasing cloud cover or decreasing solar intensity.

The cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and Tafel curve studies revealed that the unique CuS/WS2 and CuS/MoS2 heterostructures were beneficial in achieving high electrocatalytic activity, low charge-transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface, and fast reaction kinetics for the reduction of triiodide to iodide at the CE. The constructed DSSCs using these CuS/WS2 and CuS/MoS2 CEs exhibited high-power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 8.21% and 7.12%, respectively, which are comparable to conventional Pt CE (8.74%) and pristine WS2, MoS2, and CuS CEs (6.0%, 6.3% and 6.4%). This novel sulfur based heterostructure opens up opportunities for a variety of optoelectronic and photoelectrochemical applications.

The fDSSC was fabricated by replacing a typical fluorine-doped tin oxide glass substrate of the platinum CE with a flexible indium tin oxide-coated poly(ethylene naphthalate) substrate. The CSM was a triple-layered membrane composed of poly(ethylene terephthalate) nonwoven fabric between the poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) gel layers, which provided a sandwich-like structure. The fDSSC with the CSM exhibited relatively good electrolyte retention capability and improved interfacial contact between the components, affording an fDSSC with high energy conversion efficiency and stable long-term performance. The potential of a CSM as an efficient component for durable flexible energy devices is demonstrated.

Dye3 can significantly stabilize the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of an organic dye. We used density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations to better understand the factors responsible for the photovoltaic performance. The absorption spectrum of the dyes showed different forms because of the different energy levels of the molecular orbital (MO) of each dye and the intramolecular energy transfer (EnT). Among the three dyes, dye3 showed greater red-shift, broader absorption spectra, and higher molar extinction coefficient. These results indicate that adding a withdrawing unit and pi-conjugation to a dye can result in good photovoltaic properties for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).

The gamma-copper (I) iodide (CuI) behaves as a p-type semiconductor with a zinc blende structure (cubic) and it has previously been studied as a hole-selective layer in organic solar cells, solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells. In this paper, CuI thin films with wide band gaps and large work functions were fabricated on n-type silicon substrates via a thermal evaporation technique. Changes to the structural, morphological and optical properties of CuI thin films based on different thicknesses (11 to 58 nm) were analyzed. X-ray diffraction patterns reveal that poly crystalline CuI thin films a have.-phase with preferential growth in the (111) direction. Increases in the peak intensity for the (111) diffraction plane were observed in the thicker films. Generally, deposited CuI films exhibit triangular shapes with azimuthal orientation but these shapes disappeared as the film thickness was increased. Excellent electrical and optical properties were obtained at a CuI film thickness of 11 nm; measured values were 642 mV implied voltage, similar to 3.00 eV band gap energy, 5.68 eV work function value and 97.5% transmittance.

Unique porous microstructures (lamellar or interconnected pore structures) were obtained by controlling the concentrations of slurry and binder. The freeze-casted photoelectrodes exhibited stronger light scattering effects than conventionally screen-printed mesoporous photoelectrode. This is attributed to a great number of scattering sites (interconnected pores with the size range of 50500 nm), which are uniformly distributed throughout the entire freeze-casted photoelectrodes, resulting in an enhancement of the light pathway. As a result, despite a lower dye adsorption and less kinetically efficient charge transport, DSSCs based on freeze-casted photoelectrodes showed significant conversion efficiencies (3.64%) compared with those of DSSCs based on conventionally screen-printed photoelectrodes (2.57%). This study suggests that the hierarchical porous photoelectrodes fabricated using the freeze-casting are promising candidates for highly efficient DSSCs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To achieve high electrical conductivity and transparent characteristics, the wavelength of the flash white light was selectively chosen and irradiated by using high-pass, low-pass, and band-pass filters. The flash white light irradiation conditions such as on-time, off-time, and number of pulses were also optimized. The wavelength range (400500 nm) corresponding to the plasmonic wavelength of the AgNW could efficiently weld the AgNW films and enhance its conductivity. To carry out in-depth study of the welding phenomena with respect to wavelength, a multiphysics COMSOL simulation was conducted. The welded AgNW films under selective plasmonic flash light welding conditions showed the lowest sheet resistance (51.275 Omega/sq) and noteworthy transmittance (95.3%). Finally, the AgNW film, which was welded by selective wavelength plasmonic flash light with optical filters, was successfully used to make a large area transparent heat film and dye-sensitized solar cells showing superior performances.

The microridge made of several Ti micropits is inserted into TiO2 layer to shorten the photoelectron transport distance from the original place in the TiO2 layer to substrate and to increase the electron transport rate. The Ti micropits are used as light-gathering centers to collect the reflected light. Meanwhile, the Ti nanorods are evenly distributed on the surface of the microridge-coated Ti wire substrate, which increases the contact area between the substrate and the TiO2 layer in order to suppress the electron recombination and scatters the incident light to further improve the light-harvesting ability. Therefore, the charge collection and power conversion efficiencies of the novel FDSSC have been accordingly enhanced by 17.7% and 61.6%, respectively, compared with traditional FDSSC. Moreover, the structural stability of the novel FDSSC has been strengthened.

J	Dao, VD; Choi, HS				Van-Duong Dao; Choi, Ho-Suk			Balance between the charge transfer resistance and diffusion impedance in a CNT/Pt counter electrode for highly efficient liquid-junction photovoltaic devices	ORGANIC ELECTRONICS			English	Article						CNT/Pt; Nanohybrid materials; Counter electrode; Dye-sensitized solar cell	SENSITIZED SOLAR-CELLS; LOW-COST; ASSISTED STRATEGY; PERFORMANCE; NANOPARTICLES; BEHAVIOR; REDUCTION	This study investigates changes in the charge transfer resistance (R-ct) and diffusion impedance (Z(w)) according to the thickness of a CNT/Pt layer coated onto an FTO glass counter electrode (CE) to improve the photovoltaic performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). For this purpose, we carefully controlled the thickness of the CE by using different amounts of CNT/Pt in the paste. Note that both R-ct, and Z(w) decrease with an increase in the thickness of the CEs. Power conversion efficiencies of 7.77, 8.21, 7.58 and 7.36% are determined for DSCs with thicknesses of the CNT/Pt layer of 1, 3.2, 10 and 18 mu m, respectively. The obtained results are in good agreement with the changes in the ratio of R-ct/Z(w).When the ratio of R-ct/Z(w) becomes one and the R-ct value is less than 1 Omega cm(2), the device shows the best performance. Because this strategy is simple and effective, it can be useful for developing cost-effective CE materials for DSCs.

J	Li, YL; Zhang, XD; Ko, MJ				Li, Yuelong; Zhang, Xiaodan; Ko, Min Jae			Direct Comparison of Electron Transport and Recombination Behaviors of Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells Prepared Using Different Sintering Processes	ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING			English	Article						Flexible dye-sensitized solar cell; Electron transport and recombination; Hot compression; High-temperature sintering; Impedance; Photocurrent-voltage transient technique	LOW-TEMPERATURE FABRICATION; TIO2 FILMS; CHARGE-TRANSPORT; EFFICIENCY; IMPEDANCE; PHOTOCARRIERS; NANOPARTICLES; PHOTOCURRENT; PHOTOANODE; CIRCUIT	Flexible dye-sensitized solar cells on plastic substrates have achieved a conversion efficiency of 8.6% with the hot compression technique (<150 degrees C). However, the value of efficiency is only 70% of that achieved using glass substrates with high-temperature sintering technique (500 degrees C). Investigating the origin of this difference is a critical step for further improving the performance of plastic dye-sensitized solar cells. In this study, an optimized ternary viscous titania paste without the addition of organic binders enables the fabrication of efficient dye-sensitized solar cells with a low-temperature process. Therefore, the electron-transport behavior of dye-sensitized solar cells can be directly compared with those prepared with the high-temperature sintering technique. In addition to the structural and optical differences, the hot compressed photoanode of dye-sensitized solar cells have an electron diffusion coefficient that is 2 times smaller and a recombination time that is 6 times shorter than those of the high-temperature sintered cells, suggesting inadequate interparticle connections and more recombination events. These results indicate that electron transport and recombination are still the key factors governing the performance of low-temperature fabricated dye-sensitized solar cells. Eventually, the flexible cell with an efficiency of 6.81% has been achieved on flexible indium tin oxide/polyethylene naphthalate substrate. Further improvements in advanced low-temperature processing or novel materials with minimized defect or grain boundaries are required.

The maximum adsorption amount of paprika oleoresin on TiO2 thin film was approximately 142 mg/g. The adsorption heterogeneity for the adsorption system of paprika oleoresin on TiO2 thin film increased with increasing temperature. Kinetic studies showed that the adsorption of paprika oleoresin on TiO2 thin film followed pseudo-first-order model.

Based on the current-voltage and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements on a test cell (similar to 9 x 5 mm), the circuit models are implemented in P-spice. It is demonstrated that the simulated DC and AC (EIS) responses are well-matched with the measurement results and that the dynamic transient response can be simulated as well. Using the circuit model, we demonstrate the dynamic responses of a DSSC module (similar to 300 x 300 mm) at various local shading conditions. The developed circuit models can be used to analyze and design a solar system using DSSC BIPV windows.

Three major synthetic modifications were performed on the Zn-porphyrin dye to obtain a lower energy sensitization and improve the catalyst lifetime. We found that incorporating acetylene and linear hexyl groups into the Zn-porphyrin core allowed facile lower energy sensitization, and the addition of the cyanophosphonic acid as an anchoring group gave the long-term dye stability on the TiO2 surface. Under irradiation with red light of >550 nm and a light intensity of 207 mW/cm(2), the hybrid ZnPCNPA catalyst showed a TONRe of similar to 800 over an extended time period of 90 h. The photocatalytic activities of porphyrin hybrids differ greatly with the binding strength of the anchoring groups of dye and spectral range of the irradiated light and its intensity.

A facile approach of introducing a compact NiO blocking layer into an active NiO photocathode network of p-DSCs and pn-DSCs is presented to enrich the power conversion efficiency (PCE) using a Co2+/3+ redox mediator. Two photoelectrodes sensitized with different dyes (SQ for n-DSC and P1 for p-DSC) have a complementary nature in absorbing solar irradiation at different wavelengths. The constructed pn-DSC demonstrates an enhanced photovoltage compared to n-DSC, resulting in an overall PCE of 1.486%. This PCE is further improved to 1.913% by the addition of an optimized NiO blocking layer to the p-DSC; this was prepared via spin-coating with a nickel acetate precursor solution. All photovoltaic parameters were significantly increased with the introduction of a blocking layer compared to a bare cell.

The introduction of the red-absorbing cationic acceptorithiophene spacer led to the broadening and bathochromic shift of the absorption maxima from an onset of 600 nm for CSI to 800 nm for CDT as well as improved molar absorptivity. The introduction of the double branching/thiophene spacer lowered the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of CDI, CST, and CDT, making their potentials more positive than that of CSI. Among these, the double branched CDI exhibited the highest conversion efficiency of 0.112%. Furthermore, all of the dyes examined outperformed the standard 043 dye (0.062%), measured under similar fabrication conditions. Despite the decreased photovoltaic performance as a result of the introduction of the thiophene spacer, overall, the double branched dyes exhibited better interfacial charge transfer that led to higher Jsc and V-OC values compared to those of singly branched dyes. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis showed that double branched dyes have much lower charge transfer resistance and increased hole lifetime than single branched dyes. Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT calculations were performed to theoretically characterize the optical and electrochemical properties of the synthesized dyes.

We fabricated TiO2 nanofibers by an electrospinning method. The porous structure of TiO2 nanofibers easily adsorbed the organic sensitizer. This also benefitted the electron transfer from the dye to the FTO electrode, because of the one-dimensional structure of the TiO2 nanofibers. The electrospinning process for fabricating the TiO2 nanofibers was optimized at an applied voltage of 20 kV. The average diameter of the TiO2 nanofibers was similar to 400 nm, while the thickness of the composite photoelectrode was 20 mu m. We observed by X-ray diffraction pattern the TiO2 nanofibers and TiO2 nanoparticles as an anatase phase. Compared with conventional TiO2 nanoparticle DSCs, TiO2-nanofiber-nanoparticle DSCs had a higher short circuit current density (J(sc)) of 12.92 mA/cm(2), and an enhanced power conversion efficiency of 4.79%.

In general, a DSSC consists of a transparent electrode, a counter electrode, and an electrolyte such as dye. To achieve high power-conversion efficiency in cells, many research groups have focused their efforts on developing efficient dyes for liquid electrolytes. In this work, we report on the photovoltaic properties of DSSCs fabricated using a mixture of TiO2 with nanosized Fe-doped bismuth lanthanum titanate (nFe-BLT) powder). Firstly, nFe-BLT powders were prepared using a high-energy ball milling process and then, TiO2 and nFe-BLT powders were stoichiometrically blended. Direct current (DC) bias of 20 MV/m was applied to lab-made DSSCs. With the optimal concentration of nFe-BLT doped in the electrode, their light-to-electricity conversion efficiency could be improved by similar to 64% compared with DSSCs where no DC bias was applied.

Addition of the new DMII dopant into the PEDOT NFs reduced the concentration of dodecyl sulfate anions (DS-) predoped during the polymerization process and concomitantly enhanced the doping concentration of I- by ion exchange. Redoping with DMII increased the mobility of the PEDOT NFs by up to 18-fold and improved the conductivity due to the enhanced linearization, suppressed aggregation, and improved crystallinity of the PEDOT chains. The catalytic activity was also improved, primarily due to the increase in the compatibility and the effective surface area upon replacement of sticky DS- with the more basic and smaller I- of DMII on the surface of the PEDOT NFs. The charge-transfer resistance across the interface between the poly(ethylene oxide)-based solid polymer electrolyte and PEDOT NF counter electrode (CE) was thus reduced to a large extent, giving an energy conversion efficiency (ECE) of 8.52% for solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), which is even better than that achieved with Pt CE (8.25%). This is the highest ECE reported for solid-state DSCs with conductive polymer CEs under 1 sun conditions.

The MoS2 is deposited according to island growth mode. As the ED time increases to 40 min, the clusters of MoS2 nano particles enlarge and thicken, but maintain nanopores between the clusters. Additional increase in ED time (to 60 min) causes clusters to merge and make the film denser. Furthermore, this MoS2 film exhibits cracks due to stress accumulated in the film. The film FTO/MoS2 (40 min) shows significantly enhanced electrocatalytic activity compared to other films. This is because the FTO/MoS2 (40 min) not only has more electrochemically active sites but also significantly facilitates charge transfer and mass transport. When it is employed as the counter electrode (CE) for quantum-dot and dye-sensitized solar cells (QD-SSC, D-SSC), the QD-SSC with FTO/MoS2 (40 min) CE exhibits even higher overall energy conversion cell efficiency (3.69%) than that with Pt CE (2.16%). Moreover, the D-SSC with FTO/MoS2 (40 min) CE exhibits cell efficiency (7.16%) similar to that with FTO/Pt CE (7.48%). This indicates that MoS2 is a promising CE for all QD-SSCs and D-SSCs.

Herein, we report the large-area growth of molybdenum telluride (MoTe2) thin films by sputteringchemical vapor deposition (CVD) on conductive glass substrates for Pt-free CEs of DSSCs. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), Tafel curve analysis, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results showed that the as-synthesized MoTe2 exhibited good electrocatalytic properties and a low charge transfer resistance at the electrolyte-electrode interface. The optimized MoTe2 CE revealed a high power conversion efficiency of 7.25% under a simulated solar illumination of 100 mW cm(-2) (AM 1.5), which was comparable to the 8.15% observed for a DSSC with a Pt CE. The low cost and good electrocatalytic properties of MoTe2 thin films make them as an alternative CE for DSSCs.

Graphene nanoplatelets (GnPs) are possible alternatives to Pt CEs but they are mechanically unstable as CEs due to their poor substrate adhesion. Here we report a new type of PEDOT:PSS (PP)/GnP (PPG) composite that maintains the catalytic performance of GnPs with enhanced adhesion to the substrate via a conductive PEDOT matrix. The resultant PPG exhibited extremely low charge-transfer resistance (R-ct) compared to Pt in its role as an electrocatalyst toward a Co(bpy)(3)(2+/3+) (bpy = 2,2-bipyridine) redox couple, and displayed extremely high electrochemical stability for Co(bpy)(3)(3+) reduction even after 1000 cycles. The inter-stacking of GnP layers between PEDOT and PSS was confirmed by XPS and Raman spectra. It helps to delocalize charges in the PEDOT backbone and rapidly transfers electrons from the external circuit to Co(bpy)(3)(3+). This reduces the R-ct and ultimately improves the photovoltaic performance. The DSSC based on Y123 sensitizer and PPG-CE showed a higher photovoltaic performance of 8.33% than its Pt counterpart does (7.99%) under the optimized conditions.

However, reusability of the power output from the light source can help to recycle a small portion of the expended power. Third generation solar cells, such as organic solar cells (OSC), and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC), are semi-transparent and can be fabricated on flexible substrates. These desirable characteristics make them suitable candidates to be employed in applications such as smart windows, low-light harvesting systems, and wireless sensor nodes. Illuminance of household lighting is usually in the range of 500 lux. Our researched focused on optimizing the device structure of a conventional OSC to maximize its power conversion efficiency (PCE). When illuminated under a 500 lux light emitting diode (LED) light source. We have integrated optical modelling with empirical fitting of experimental data to conclude the most optimized structure for the low-light harvesting indoor photovoltaic (IPV) device.

Many studies have presented strategies to enhance the electrical conductivity of MWCNT/polymer composites. However, systematic studies on the effects of MWCNT features on the composite properties are still missing. Such studies can further the development of MWCNT/polymer-based conducting materials. Herein, we characterize composite films of MWCNTs and poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polymerized with poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), with variations in the MWCNT diameter and purity. MWCNT features greatly affect the physical/chemical/electrical properties of the MWCNT/PEDOT:PSS composite films. In addition, the diameter and purity of MWCNTs also influenced the transition behavior of the composite films during the hydrochloric acid-methanol treatment, which was performed for increasing electrical conductivity. As a result, we could optimize the performance of organic transistors and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) using MWCNT/PEDOT:PSS composite films as source/drain electrodes and catalytic counter electrodes, respectively. Furthermore, using the optimized device parameters, we successfully fabricated high performance fluorine doped tin oxide-free DSSCs and high-gain organic complementary inverters using MWCNT/PEDOT:PSS composite electrodes.
