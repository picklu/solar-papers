Herein, we explore the use of the Ti3C2 MXene in organic-inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs). SnO2-Ti3C2 MXene nanocomposites with different contents of Ti3C2 (0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 2.5 wt parts per thousand) were used as electron transport layers (ETLs) in low-temperature processed planar-structured PSCs. Mixing SnO2 with 1.0 wt parts per thousand Ti3C2 effectively increases the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 17.23% to 18.34%, whereas the device prepared with pristine Ti3C2 as the ETL achieves a PCE of 5.28%. Photoluminescence and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results reveal that metallic Ti3C2 MXene nanosheets provide superior charge transfer paths, enhancing electron extraction, electron mobility, and decreasing the electron transfer resistance at the ETL/perovskite interface, and thus leading to higher photocurrents. This work proposes a new field of application for MXenes and a promising method to increase the efficiency of solar cells.

J	Xie, G; Xu, L; Sun, L; Xiong, Y; Wu, P; Hu, B				Xie, Guo; Xu, Ling; Sun, Lin; Xiong, Yan; Wu, Ping; Hu, Bin			Insight into the reaction mechanism of water, oxygen and nitrogen molecules on a tin iodine perovskite surface	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; AB-INITIO; STABILITY; DEGRADATION; CH3NH3PBI3; STATE; ELECTRONEGATIVITY; DENSITY; ENERGY	In this article, in order to study the lead-free perovskite CH3NH3SnI3 (MASnI(3)) reaction mechanism between perovskite surface molecules and gas molecules, we fabricated models for three different gas molecules adsorbing on an MASnI(3) surface. First, the surface energies of seven low-index surfaces ((100), (010), (001), (110), (101), (011) and (111)) of orthorhombic MASnI(3) were calculated by density functional theory (DFT). The results showed the (011) surface was the most stable among the seven low index surfaces by the PW91 method. Secondly, three stable configurations were sorted out from these adsorption models of different molecules (H2O, O-2, N-2) at six positions on the (011) surface. For H2O, O-2 and N-2 adsorption, the smallest adsorption energies were -1.931(934) eV, -0.134(67) eV and -0.049(523) eV, respectively. The stabilities of configurations for H2O adsorption were affected by the strong interaction of the H-I bond. However, for O-2 adsorption, the Sn-O bond and charge transfer between the Sn atom and O atom mostly affected the stability of the configuration. We found that the MASnI(3) surface under a N-2 atmosphere maintained a higher stability than in the other two cases. In addition, we further confirmed that the mechanism of H2O adsorption was not the same as O-2 and N-2 molecular adsorption from the Mulliken population, energy band and electrical density of state calculations. These results indicated that the H-I bond and Sn-O bond mainly affect the Sn-I bond, leading to MASnI(3) stability being worse in H2O and O-2 environments, respectively, and performance in a N-2 environment is more stable than in O-2 and H2O environments. This investigation enhanced understanding of the degradation of perovskite and provided some suggestions for developing more stable lead-free perovskite solar cells and devices.

B-Site doped lead halide perovskites: synthesis, band engineering, photophysics, and light emission applications	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C			English	Review							DOPANT ENERGY-TRANSFER; SOLAR-CELLS; QUANTUM DOTS; INORGANIC PEROVSKITE; BROMIDE PEROVSKITES; CARRIER LIFETIME; CATION-EXCHANGE; SINGLE-CRYSTALS; NANOCRYSTALS; EFFICIENT	Lead halide perovskite (LHP) semiconductors with the general chemical formula ABX(3) are now being widely investigated for a variety of applications including but not limited to high-efficiency photovoltaics (PVs) and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Introducing impurity atoms into the LHP host through doping imparts new and interesting magnetic, electronic, and optical properties. Recent studies of doped LHPs have demonstrated great potential for their optoelectronic applications. In this review, we focus on the recent progress in B-site doped LHPs including isovalent metal ions such as alkaline-earth metal ions (Ba2+, Sr2+), transition metal ions (Mn2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Ni2+), and heterovalent metal ions exemplified by rare earth ions, Al3+, Fe3+ and Bi3+. In particular, electronic band engineering and electron/energy transfer processes in relation to doping are discussed in detail. We also highlight light emission applications of doped LHPs that take advantage of their strongly luminescent properties. Finally, we briefly discuss some remaining challenges and possible future directions for further research and development.

The "soft" nature of these materials, as characterized by their low formation energy and Young's modulus, and high thermal expansion coefficients, not only enables thin films to be fabricated via low-temperature deposition methods but also presents rich opportunities for manipulating film formation. This comprehensive review explores how the unique chemistry of these materials can be exploited to tailor film growth processes and highlights the connections between processing methods and the resulting film characteristics. The discussion focuses principally on methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3 or MAPbI(3)), which serves as a useful and well-studied model system for examining the unique attributes of halide perovskites, but various other important members of this family are also considered. The resulting film properties are discussed in the context of the characteristics necessary for achieving high-performance optoelectronic devices and accurate measurement of physical properties.

CHEMICAL REVIEWS			English	Review							METHYLAMMONIUM LEAD IODIDE; ENERGY-LEVEL ALIGNMENT; ORGANOMETAL TRIHALIDE PEROVSKITE; ANGLE-RESOLVED PHOTOEMISSION; HOLE-TRANSPORTING MATERIAL; ATOMIC LAYER DEPOSITION; VALENCE-BAND MAXIMUM; OPEN-CIRCUIT VOLTAGE; HYBRID SOLAR-CELLS; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE	Design and modification of interfaces, always a critical issue for semiconductor devices, has become a primary tool to harness the full potential of halide perovskite (HaP)-based optoelectronics, including photovoltaics and light-emitting diodes. In particular, the outstanding improvements in HaP solar cell performance and stability can be primarily ascribed to a careful choice of the interfacial layout in the layer stack. In this review, we describe the unique challenges and opportunities of these approaches (section 1). For this purpose, we first elucidate the basic physical and chemical properties of the exposed HaP thin film and crystal surfaces, including topics such as surface termination, surface reactivity, and electronic structure (section 2). This is followed by discussing experimental results on the energetic alignment processes at the interfaces between the HaP and transport and buffer layers. This section includes understandings reached as well as commonly proposed and applied models, especially the often-questionable validity of vacuum level alignment, the importance of interface dipoles, and band bending as the result of interface formation (section 3). We follow this by elaborating on the impact of the interface formation on device performance, considering effects such as chemical reactions and surface passivation on interface energetics and stability. On the basis of these concepts, we propose a roadmap for the next steps in interfacial design for HaP semiconductors (section 4), emphasizing the importance of achieving control over the interface energetics and chemistry (i.e., reactivity) to allow predictive power for tailored interface optimization.

Compositional and Solvent Engineering in Dion-Jacobson 2D Perovskites Boosts Solar Cell Efficiency and Stability	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						Dion Jacobson; low dimensionality; perovskites; solar cells	LEAD IODIDE PEROVSKITES; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; RECOMBINATION; TIN; METHYLAMMONIUM; DIMENSIONALITY; CATIONS; LAYERS	Hybrid halide 2D perovskites deserve special attention because they exhibit superior environmental stability compared with their 3D analogs. The closer interlayer distance discovered in 2D Dion-Jacobson (DJ) type of halide perovskites relative to 2D Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) perovskites implies better carrier charge transport and superior performance in solar cells. Here, the structure and properties of 2D DJ perovskites employing 3-(aminomethyl)piperidinium (3AMP(2+)) as the spacing cation and a mixture of methylammonium (MA(+)) and formamidinium (FA(+)) cations in the perovskite cages are presented. Using single-crystal X-ray crystallography, it is found that the mixed-cation (3AMP)(MA(0.75)FA(0.25))(3)Pb4I13 perovskite has a narrower bandgap, less distorted inorganic framework, and larger Pb Symbol of the Klingon Empire I Symbol of the Klingon Empire Pb angles than the single-cation (3AMP)(MA)(3)Pb4I13. Furthermore, the (3AMP)(MA(0.75)FA(0.25))(3)Pb4I13 films made by a solvent-engineering method with a small amount of hydriodic acid have a much better film morphology and crystalline quality and more preferred perpendicular orientation. As a result, the (3AMP)(MA(0.75)FA(0.25))(3)Pb4I13-based solar cells exhibit a champion power conversion efficiency of 12.04% with a high fill factor of 81.04% and a 50% average efficiency improvement compared to the pristine (3AMP)(MA)(3)Pb4I13 cells. Most importantly, the 2D DJ 3AMP-based perovskite films and devices show better air and light stability than the 2D RP butylammonium-based perovskites and their 3D analogs.

Cs2NaBiCl6:Mn2+ - A New Orange-Red Halide Double Perovskite Phosphor	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							ROOM-TEMPERATURE; QUANTUM DOTS; SOLAR-CELL; CSPBX3; BR; NANOCRYSTALS; TRANSITIONS; DESIGN; GAP; CL	In this work, we report on the promising photoluminescent behavior of the cubic double perovskite Cs2NaBiCl6 doped with Mn2+ ions. Localized excitations centered on Bi3+ ions in the host lattice strongly absorb near-UV light. In the undoped host compound, only very weak photoluminescence is observed, but in manganese-doped samples, energy transfer from Bi3+ to Mn2+ leads to intense orange-red photoluminescence. A broad emission peak centered at 590 nm is assigned to the T-4(1) -> (6)A(1) transition of octahedrally coordinated Mn2+. The excitation spectrum contains peaks at 294 and 354 nm that arise from 6s(2) -> 6s(1)6p(1) excitations of Bi3+ ions. If the chloride ions are partially replaced by bromide ions, the strongest excitation peak red-shifts to 375 nm. The lack of expensive reagents and toxic elements and the ability to tune the excitation and emission spectra through chemical substitution make Cs2NaBiCl6-xBrx:Mn2+ a promising phosphor system.

It was observed that, after being annealed at a relative humidity of 30% for 2 h, the short-circuit current density, fill factor, and open circuit voltage were all improved, leading to an improvement of 21.75% of power conversion efficiency [from 10.53 (+/- 0.98)% to 12.82 (+/- 1.07)%, with the optimized one at 14.77% for reverse scanning]. The transient photovoltage/photocurrent decay measurement and impedance spectroscopy study showed that, after being annealed at a relative humidity of 30%, the charge extraction rate was accelerated and charge transfer resistance was reduced, while recombination between photo-generated charges was retarded. Scanning electron microscopy studies indicated that voids were reduced between the perovskite film and the carbon electrode, which was ascribed to the re-coarsening process of the perovskite during the post-annealing process as revealed by the X-ray diffraction study. The improved contact accelerated holeextraction between the perovskite film and the carbon electrode and then upgraded device performance. Published under license by AIP Publishing.

However, the performance of devices based on this concept has been limited by the poor efficiency of plasmon-hot electron conversion at the metal/semiconductor interface. Here, we report that the efficiency of interfacial hot excitation transfer can be substantially improved in hybrid metal semiconductor nano-heterostructures consisting of perovskite semiconductors. In Ag-CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, both the plasmon-induced hot electron and the resonant energy transfer processes can occur on a time scale of less than 100 fs with quantum efficiencies of 50 +/- 18% and 15 +/- 5%, respectively. The markedly high efficiency of hot electron transfer observed here can be ascribed to the increased metal/semiconductor coupling compared with those in conventional systems. These findings suggest that hybrid architectures of metal and perovskite semiconductors may be excellent candidates to achieve highly efficient plasmon-induced hot carrier devices.

The role of plasmonic coupling and photonic cavities in enhancing light-matter interactions and manipulating carrier dynamics is clearly presented by examples of studies of perovskite-hybrid plasmonic nanostructured perovskite cavities. Perovskite metasurface is a nascent approach to enhancing photonic device performance that is also briefly described. In addition, nonlinear optical interactions and charge carrier dynamics in (pseudo-) 2D perovskites and photonic structures are discussed. We discuss how photonic communication between a perovskite layer and an interlayer of photoactive organic material in hybrid perovskites contributes to new designs for novel devices. Applications covered are: photodetectors, solar cells, light-emitting diodes and nanolasers, displays, waveguides and modulators, and nonlinear optical devices. Device performance is enhanced by incorporating nanophotonics design concepts. The review concludes with a discussion of technical challenges. New opportunities in multiscale modeling, perovskites with epsilon near zero, perovskites-plasmonic semiconductors, perovskite sensors and quantum applications are presented also presented in the concluding outlook section.

Compared with other HSL materials used in efficient perovskite solar cells, Cu3PS4 has the smallest effective mass for holes. Additionally, Cu3PS4 has a valence band energy level of -5.05 eV, which is suitable for effectively extracting holes generated in perovskite absorbers. These reveal intrinsic properties of Cu3PS4 that make it an excellent HSL material for perovskite solar cells. We further find that a Cu3PS4 nanoparticle HSL promotes grain growth of perovskite thin films, which benefits device performance. Our perovskite solar cells using a Cu3PS4 nanoparticle HSL achieve a maximum power conversion efficiency of 18.17% with small hysteresis and a high fill factor of 81.6%, which is significantly better than the performance of the best control device using the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) HSL.

Charge Transfer Dynamics of Phase-Segregated Halide Perovskites: CH3NH3PbCl3 and CH3NH3PbI3 or (C4H9NH3)(2)(CH3NH3)(n-1)Pb(n)I(3n+1)Mixtures	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						halide perovskites; 2D perovskites; CH3NH3PbCl3; phase-segregated; charge transfer dynamics	TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; HYBRID SOLAR-CELLS; EFFICIENCY; ELECTRON; FILMS; HOLE; MORPHOLOGY; TRANSPORT; CRYSTAL; LENGTHS	Lead halide perovskites present a versatile class of solution-processable semiconductors with highly tunable bandgaps that span ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared portions of the spectrum. We explore phase-separated chloride and iodide lead perovskite mixtures as candidate materials for intermediate band applications in future photovoltaics. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy reveal that deposition of precursor solutions across the MAPbCl(3)/MAPbI(3) composition space affords quasi-epitaxial cocrystallized films, in which the two perovskites do not alloy but instead remain phase-segregated. First-principle calculations further support the formation of an epitaxial interface and predict energy offsets in the valence band and conduction band edges that could result in intermediate energy absorption. The charge dynamics of variable mixtures of the relatively narrow bandgap (1.57 eV) MAPbI(3) perovskite and wide bandgap (3.02 eV) MAPbCl(3) are probed to map charge and energy flow direction and kinetics. Time-resolved photoluminescence and transient absorption measurements reveal charge transfer of photoexcited carriers in MAPbCl(3) to MAPbI(3) in tens of picoseconds.

These device advancements are currently hindered by the light-induced phase segregation effect, whereby ion migration would yield smaller-bandgap domains with red-shifted photoluminescence. Here we show that upon laser excitation all-inorganic mixed-halide nanocrystals unexpectedly exhibit a blue shift in the photoluminescence peak that can revert back in the dark, thus depicting the processes of ion migration out of and back to the originally excited nanocrystals. Interestingly, this reversible photoluminescence shift can also be induced by electrical biasing of mixed-halide nanocrystals without the injection of charge carriers. The above findings suggest that it is the local electric field that breaks the ionic bonds in mixed-halide nanocrystals, which could be a universal origin for light-induced phase segregation observed in other mixed-halide perovskite materials.

Photon management allows for increasing the short-circuit current and energy conversion efficiency of perovskite single junction and perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells due to improved light incoupling and/or light trapping. In this study, an electrically flat but optically rough solar cell design is investigated, which combines the benefit of reaching high short-circuit currents, while maintaining the integrity of perovskite films processed on planar substrates or surfaces. Consequently, the perovskite films exhibit electrical properties comparable to planar perovskite solar cells, which allows for achieving solar cells with high open circuit voltage and fill factors. Electrically flat but optically rough perovskite solar cell structures can be successfully implemented because the perovskite material system and the contact materials of the solar cells exhibit comparable refractive indices. This sets the perovskite material system with its low refractive index apart from other high refractive index materials like silicon or germanium. Hence the proposed design of an electrically flat but optically rough solar cell cannot be applied to silicon or germanium solar cells. The design of perovskite single junction solar cells is discussed, and electrically flat but optically rough solar cells are compared to electrically and optically rough solar cells. The design of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells is investigated by using a hybrid approach, which combines Finite Difference Time Domain optical simulations of perovskite top and experimentally measured crystalline bottom solar cells. Detailed guidelines are provided on how to achieve high short-circuit currents. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Fullerene compounds are a very popular electron-transfer material in these devices. In a previous report, it has been shown that while an ultrathin fullerene layer of just 1 nm is sufficient to achieve good device performance, removal of this layer causes a drastic decrease in performance. We provide an explanation to these observed effects by use of a numerical device model. This work provides theoretical support to the experimental understanding of the dominant role of fullerenes in perovskite solar cells. (C) 2019 Author(s).

However, the toxicity and instability of best-in-class lead-halide perovskite materials make them nonideal. To combat these issues, we replaced lead with bismuth and explored the sensitivity of these new lead-free materials to the valency and bonding of their cationic organic groups. Specifically, we synthesized and characterized the materials properties and photophysical properties of hexane-1,6-diammonium bismuth pentaiodide ((HDA(2+))BiI5) and compared them to an analogue containing a more volatile organic group with half the number of carbon and nitrogen atoms in the form of n-propylammonium ((PA(+))(x)BiI3+x, where 1 < x < 3). The full crystallographic structures of (HDA(2+))BiI5 and (PA(+))(x)BiI3+x, were resolved by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. (HDA(2+))BiI5 was shown to be pure-phase and have a one-dimensional structure, whereas (PA(+))(x)BiI3+x was shown to be a mix of one-dimensional and zero-dimensional phases. Structures of the materials were confirmed by synchrotron X-ray diffraction of powders. Both (HDA(2+))BiI5 and (PA(+))(x)BiI3+x exhibit steady-state photoluminescence at room temperature. Density functional theory calculations of (HDA(2+))BiI5 predict electronic absorption features and a similar to 2 eV bandgap that are consistent with those observed experimentally. Structure-property relationships of the materials were examined, and moisture tolerance and film quality were found to be superior for dication-containing (HDA(2+))BiI5 in relation to monocation-containing (PA(+))(x)BiI3+x. We hypothesize that these trends are in part due to a molecular bridging effect enabled by the presence of the dicationic hexanediammonium groups in (HDA(2+))BiI5. Solar cells fabricated using (HDA(2+))BiI5 as the photoactive layer exhibited photovoltaic action while those containing (PA(+))(x)BiI3+x did not, suggesting that organic dicationic groups are beneficial to light-absorber morphology and ultimately solar-cell performance.

High-Performance Perovskite Solar Cells with a Non-doped Small Molecule Hole Transporting Layer	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						inverted perovskite solar cells; hole transporting layer; small molecule; NPB; dopant-free; long-term stability	EFFICIENT	The use of solution-processed hole transporting layers (HTLs), without the need of added dopants, is important for the advancement of high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a small molecule, N,N'-bis(naphthalen-1-yl)-N,N'-bis(phenyl)benzidine (NPB), is utilized as an efficient, dopant-free HTL in inverted PSCs to replace the commonly used poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly-(styrenesulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS). A best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.96% is realized when using NPB as the HTL, along with a short circuit current density (J(SC)) of 22.92 mA/cm(2), an open circuit voltage (V-OC) of 1.11 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 78.4%. This V-OC is one of the highest obtained values in CH3NH3PbI3-based inverted PSCs and is comparable to devices with regular structure. The use of NPB as the HTL produced perovskite films with larger grain size and higher crystallinity than obtained with PEDOT:PSS. As a result of this improved perovskite film quality, recombination loss decreased dramatically, boosting J(SC) values. Furthermore, due to reduced recombination and better energy level alignment arising from the use of NPB, the V-OC in the NPB-containing device increased considerably. In addition, NPB-based PSCs exhibited longer term stability as a result of the hydrophobicity of NPB.

In comparison with planar structures, however, triple mesoscopic structures typically show lower open-circuit voltages (V-oc). Evidence suggests that nonradiative recombination governed by the mismatched energy levels between the perovskite film and the electron-transporting layer (or hole-transporting layer) is the main cause for photovoltage losses. Here we introduced a gradient bilayered zinc tin oxide (ZTO) ETL for fully printed mesoporous PSCs. This approach reduces the energy loss and augments the V-oc, which benefits from the suitable matching of cascade level between the perovskite and the ZTO ETL. By tuning of the Zn content, ZTO films with gradient energy levels and different carrier concentrations are acquired. Our optimized device delivers a high V-oc of 1.02 V and PCE of 15.86%. These findings provide a simple pathway to design the interface between ETL and perovskite and to tailor the band alignment to suppress interfacial trap-assisted recombination of fully printed mesoporous PSCs for enhancing V-oc and charge extraction simultaneously.

In this study, new and related copper halide hybrid organic-inorganic materials containing dicationic hexane-1,6-diammonium (+H3N-C6H12-NH3+) demonstrated superior stability to heat and moisture in comparison to the analogous material containing monocationic n-propylammonium (C3H7-NH3+) in twice the stoichiometry. Electronic absorption spectra taken of the materials were consistent with an indirect optical bandgap of similar to 1.8 eV, making them well-suited for application as the photoactive layer in the top cell of a tandem solar cell with silicon. The best-performing single-junction solar cells containing the dicationic material as the photoactive layer exhibited an open circuit photovoltage in excess of 400 mV and a short-circuit photocurrent density of similar to 30 mu A/cm(2). These values are similar to those reported for state-of-the-art copper halide hybrid organic-inorganic materials containing organic monocations and motivate further research this class of materials.

Time-Resolved Electrical Scanning Probe Microscopy of Layered Perovskites Reveals Spatial Variations in Photoinduced Ionic and Electronic Carrier Motion	ACS NANO			English	Article						layered perovskites; time-resolved electrostatic force microscopy; G-Mode; Kelvin probe force microscopy; big data microscopy; Ruddlesden-Popper	ORGANOMETAL TRIHALIDE PEROVSKITE; ELECTROSTATIC FORCE MICROSCOPY; METAL-HALIDE PEROVSKITES; SOLAR-CELLS; KELVIN PROBE; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; TRAP FORMATION; WORK FUNCTION; THIN-FILMS; MIGRATION	We study light-induced dynamics in thin films comprising Ruddlesden-Popper phases of the layered 2D perovskite (C4H9NH3)(2)PbI4. We probe ionic and electronic carrier dynamics using two complementary scanning probe methods, time-resolved G-mode Kelvin probe force microscopy and fast free time-resolved electrostatic force microscopy, as a function of position, time, and illumination. We show that the average surface photovoltage sign is dominated by the band bending at the buried perovskite-substrate interface. However, the film exhibits substantial variations in the spatial and temporal response of the photovoltage. Under illumination, the photovoltage equilibrates over hundreds of microseconds, a time scale associated with ionic motion and trapped electronic carriers. Surprisingly, we observe that the surface photovoltage of the 2D grain centers evolves more rapidly in time than at the grain boundaries. We propose that the slower evolution at grain boundaries is due to a combination of ion migration occurring between PbI4 planes, as well as electronic carriers traversing grain boundary traps, thereby changing the time-dependent band unbending at grain boundaries. These results provide a model for the photoinduced dynamics in 2D perovskites and are a useful basis for interpreting photovoltage dynamics on hybrid 2D/3D structures.

Si photocathode with Ag-supported dendritic Cu catalyst for CO2 reduction	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							EFFICIENT PHOTOELECTROCHEMICAL REDUCTION; SOLAR-DRIVEN REDUCTION; AQUEOUS CARBON-DIOXIDE; ELECTROCHEMICAL REDUCTION; ENERGY-CONVERSION; MONOLITHIC DEVICE; GALLIUM-PHOSPHIDE; WATER; CELLS; PHOTOSYNTHESIS	Si photocathodes integrated with Ag-supported dendritic Cu catalysts are used to perform light-driven reduction of CO2 to C-2 and C-3 products in aqueous solution. A back illumination geometry with an n-type Si absorber was used to permit the use of absorbing metallic catalysts. Selective carrier collection was accomplished by a p(+) implantation on the illumination side and an n(+) implantation followed by atomic layer deposition of TiO2 on the electrolyte site. The Ag-supported dendritic Cu CO2 reduction catalyst was formed by evaporation of Ag followed by high-rate electrodeposition of Cu to form a high surface area structure. Under simulated 1 sun illumination in 0.1 M CsHCO3 saturated with CO2, the photovoltage generated by the Si (approximate to 600 mV) enables C-2 and C-3 products to be produced at -0.4 vs. RHE. Texturing of both sides of the Si increases the light-limited current density, due to reduced reflection on the illumination side, and also deceases the onset potential. Under simulated diurnal illumination conditions photocathodes maintain over 60% faradaic efficiency to hydrocarbon and oxygenate products (mainly ethylene, ethanol, propanol) for several days. After 10 days of testing, contamination from the counter electrode is observed, which causes an increase in hydrogen production. This effect is mitigated by a regeneration procedure which restores the original catalyst selectivity. A tandem, self-powered CO2 reduction device was formed by coupling a Si photocathode with two series-connected semitransparent CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells, achieving an efficiency for the conversion of sunlight to hydrocarbons and oxygenates of 1.5% (3.5% for all products).

Using electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD), the crystal orientation in methylammonium lead iodide thin films with submicrometer resolution is reported. For the vast majority of (110) oriented grains, the c-axis of the perovskite unit cell is oriented in-plane. Although some adjacent grains exhibit the same in-plane horizontal orientation of the c-axis, no universal horizontal orientation of the c-axis within the sample plane exists. The (110) crystal orientation correlates with an in-plane orientation of the ferroelectric polarization as investigated by vertical and lateral piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). The individual grains with different crystal orientations that exhibit different ferroelectric patterns and surface potentials are identified. The strong correlation between crystal orientation and ferroelectric polarization allows conclusions to be drawn about the microstructure from PFM measurements and, likewise, the ferroelectric polarization to be derived from crystallographic observations by EBSD.

It is shown that as the substrate temperature increases, one has to increase the flux of MAI as indicated by higher vapour pressure in the reactor to maintain the appropriate stoichiometry of the devices. The pressure of MAI was maintained at 5.5-6x10(-5)Torr and PbI2 rate of deposition was maintained at 0.75A/s for a room temperature substrate deposition. For higher substrate temperature depositions at 50 degrees C and 75 degrees C we had to elevate the MAI pressure because of re-evaporation of MAI from the substrate at higher temperatures. A power conversion efficiency of >17.4% has been achieved with a p-i-n device architecture of FTO/PTAA (polytriaryl amine)/MAPbI(3)/PCBM (phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester)/Al through careful control of the MAI pressure and PbI2 evaporation rate. Higher substrate temperature devices showed improved grain sizes. The devices do not show any hysteresis. Devices deposited at higher substrate temperatures are significantly more photo stable over 100h of continuous light exposure in nitrogen ambient.

Effect of excessive Pb on the stability and performance of Pb-halide perovskite solar cells against photo-induced degradation	MRS COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							TEMPERATURE; LIGHT; LAYER	Perovskite solar cells have evolved significantly since their inception. However, stability is still a major concern. We fabricated devices using a glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI(3)/PCBM/Ag device configuration. Devices fabricated using the Pb-acetate precursors showed an efficiency of 13%. This work reports the effect of adding excess lead to the precursor and its impact on the light-induced degradation of efficiency. It is found that 5% excess lead is best for devices regarding the performance and stability and devices retained greater than 50% of the initial efficiency after 2 h of prolonged irradiation. We attribute this phenomenon to the formation of PbI2 which induces passivation in the grain-boundaries.	[Yerramilli, Aditya S.; Chen, Yuanqing; Alford, T.

Here, we report an additive strategy to enhance the efficiency and stability of PSCs made by scalable blading. Blade-coated PSCs incorporating bilateral alkylamine (BAA) additives achieve PCEs of 21.5 (aperture, 0.08 cm(2)) and 20.0% (aperture, 1.1 cm(2)), with a record-small open-circuit voltage deficit of 0.35 V under AM1.5G illumination. The stabilized PCE reaches 22.6% under 0.3 sun. Anchoring monolayer bilateral amino groups passivates the defects at the perovskite surface and enhances perovskite stability by exposing the linking hydrophobic alkyl chain. Grain boundaries are reinforced by BAA and are more resistant to mechanical bending and electron beam damage. BAA improves the device shelf lifetime to > 1000 hours and operation stability to > 500 hours under light, with 90% of the initial efficiency retained.

Herein, the focus is on developing a high-speed photosensor capable of obtaining high-resolution, high-speed imaging with colloidal quantum dots (QDs) as the photosensitive material. In detail, high-speed QD photodiodes are demonstrated with rising and falling times of tau(r) = 28.8 +/- 8.34 ns and tau(f) = 40 +/- 9.81 ns, respectively, realized by fast separation of electron-hole pairs due to the action of internal electric field at the QD interface, mainly by the interaction between metal oxide and the QD's ligands. Such energy transfer relations are analyzed and interpreted with time-resolved photoluminescence measurements, providing physical understanding of the device and working principles.

Recently, Cs2AgBiBr6 double perovskite achieved by replacing two Pb2+ with Ag+ and Bi3+ in the crystal lattice has drawn much attention owing to the convenient substitution of its chemical compositions. Herein, the dependence of the optoelectronic properties and corresponding photovoltaic performance of Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films on the deposition methods of vacuum sublimation and solution processing is investigated. Compared to the vacuum sublimation based one, the solution-processed Cs2AgBiBr6 shows inherently higher crystallinity, narrower electronic bandgap, longer photo-excitation lifetime, and higher mobility. The excellent optoelectronic properties are attributed to the accurate composition stoichiometry of Cs2AgBiBr6 films based on solution processing. These merits enable the corresponding perovskite solar cells to deliver a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.51%, which is the highest PCE in the Cs2AgBiBr6-based double perovskite solar cells to date. The finding in this work provides a clear clue that a precise composition stoichiometry could guarantee the formation of high quality multicomponent perovskite films.

We have now performed ultrafast spectroelectrochemical experiments on ITO/Cul electrodes to show the effect of applied bias on the excited -state dynamics in CuI. Under operating conditions, the recombination of excitons is dependent on the applied bias, and it can be accelerated by decreasing the potential from +0.6 to 0.1 V vs Ag/AgCl. Prebiasing experiments show the persistent and reversible "memory" effect of electrochemical bias on charge carrier lifetimes. The excitation of CuI in a CuI/CsPbBr3 film provides synergy between both CuI and CsPbBr3 in dictating the charge separation and recombination.

Here, we demonstrated a three-step all-vapor conversion route method to deposit uniform, pinhole-free CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films with high crystallinity and purity. Notably, stable cubic-phase CH3NH3PbI3 converted at high temperature (>= 160 degrees C) could survive at room temperature, which is desired for high efficiency and long-term stability of organic-inorganic halide-based optoelectric devices. Additionally, this method has the potential for large-scale production due to its low cost, high throughput, large-area uniformity, and good reproducibility.

The refractive index of CsPbI3 thin film is 2.46 at 435 nm with this result implies that Cs based lead halide solar cells may be, ideal antireflection coating for many tandem solar cells. Thus lower refractive index of CsPbI3 inorganic perovskite material is beneficial for perovskite device fabrications because of the minimum light looses to reflection at the front of the active layer. Furthermore microstructure of the cubic phase Pm-3 m was investigated by X-ray diffraction. CsPbI3 perovskite thin film showed the sharp absorption edge and PL emission near infrared region with direct band gap of 1.67 eV with high color purity of red emission. In addition, the higher dielectric function value of CsPbI3, will helps to many optoelectronic devices. (C) 2018 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Ultrafast narrowband exciton routing within layered perovskite nanoplatelets enables low-loss luminescent solar concentrators	NATURE ENERGY			English	Article							ENERGY-TRANSFER; QUANTUM DOTS; NANOCRYSTALS; METAL	In luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) systems, broadband solar energy is absorbed, down-converted and waveguided to the panel edges where peripheral photovoltaic cells convert the concentrated light to electricity. Achieving a low-loss LSC requires reducing the reabsorption of emitted light within the absorbing medium while maintaining high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Here we employ layered hybrid metal halide perovskites-ensembles of two-dimensional perovskite domains-to fabricate low-loss large-area LSCs that fulfil this requirement. We devised a facile synthetic route to obtain layered perovskite nanoplatelets (PNPLs) that possess a tunable number of layers within each platelet. Efficient ultrafast non-radiative exciton routing within each PNPL (0.1 ps(-1)) produces a large Stokes shift and a high PLQY simultaneously. Using this approach, we achieve an optical quantum efficiency of 26% and an internal concentration factor of 3.3 for LSCs with an area of 10 x 10 cm(2), which represents a fourfold enhancement over the best previously reported perovskite LSCs.

Literature in this area focuses on solution phase aspects of these materials, for example in inks for solar cells, or the growth of bulk or nanosized crystals. Critically, varying solute-solvent interactions often cause heavily mixed perovskites to have compositions that strongly deviate from their synthetic loading. In contrast, complex halide perovskites prepared by solid-state methods in the absence of solvents display much more predictable compositions and significantly suppressed phase segregation. Further, because they generate less waste, solvent-free methods are often 'greener' and more industrially scalable. Herein, we review the solvent-free methods used to synthesize single composition 'parent' and heavily mixed perovskites in the solid-state. We discuss the known mechanisms for ion diffusion involved in these transformations, summarize and contrast their main benefits and features, and review their use in the preparation of mixed-cation and/or mixed-halide perovskites.

One of the keys to achieve high-performance cost-effective PVSCs is to attain rapid crystallization with controlled morphology of the perovskite films. Herein, the authors report a technique for the rapid crystallization of perovskite with tunable crystal grain size and morphology via a seeded approach. Specifically, a solution of lead iodide (PbI2) was spin coated on a substrate, and a low-concentration solution of methylammonium iodide (MAI) was dropped onto the PbI2 film to form perovskite seeds prior to introducing high-concentration solution of MAI. The seeded nucleation and growth lead to dense and uniform perovskite thin films with controllable crystal grains. This seeded crystallization technique offers an effective way to boost the low-cost manufacture of efficient and reproducible PVSCs. Published by the AVS.

Herein, high-quality triple cation mixtures Cs(0.21)FA(0.56)MA(0.23)(I0.98Br0.02)(3) perovskite films are fabricated through two-step solution processes via in situ substrate-heating-assisted deposition under ambient conditions with a relative humidity of about 40%. The in situ substrate temperature during the deposition significantly influences the grain size and compactness of lead iodide films, and therefore greatly affects the morphology, composition, and band gap of resulted perovskite films. Based on the optimization of substrate temperature and the thickness of perovskite layer, PSCs with a planar heterojunction configuration of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag are fabricated, which deliver a power conversion efficiency up to 18.38%. These results suggest that high-performance PSCs can be fabricated under ambient conditions instead of an inert environment, providing a fundamental step for accelerating PSC commercialization.

However, the heavy metal lead is harmful to humans and the environment resulting in a need for strategies to replace this toxic element. Herein, we report a facile aqueous synthesis of CsGeX3 (X=I, Br) perovskite nanocrystals with size control achieved by varying the concentration of a cysteammonium halide ligand. We observe a variety of morphologies including pyramidal, hexagonal, and spheroidal. CsGeX3 nanocrystals undergo a lattice expansion due to partial replacement of Cs+ with larger cysteNH(3)(+) cations into their lattice. We successfully dope Mn2+ into the CsGeX3 lattice for the first time with incorporation of up to 29% in bulk and 16% in nano samples. XRD peak shifts and EPR hyperfine splitting strongly indicate that Mn2+ is doped into the lattice. Our results introduce a new member to the lead-free halide perovskite family and set the fundamental stage for their use in optoelectronic devices.

Here we investigate the process for the conversion of light to electrical current in high performance layered perovskite solar cells by examining its real morphology. The layered perovskite films in this study are found to be a mixture of layered and three dimensional (3D)-like phases with phase separations at micrometer and nanometer scale in both vertical and lateral directions. This phase separation is explained by the surface initiated crystallization process and the competition of the crystallization between 3D-like and layered perovskites. We further propose that the working mechanisms of the layered perovskite solar cells involve energy transfer from layered to 3D-like perovskite network. The impact of morphology on efficiency and stability of the hot-cast layered perovskite solar cells are also discussed to provide guidelines for the future improvement.

Printable perovskite solar cells based on MAPbI(3) in a TiO2/ZrO2/Carbon triple-layer mesoporous scaffold have shown simple fabrication process and impressive stability. Moving towards formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI(3)) as the light absorber, which has a bandgap of 1.48 eV that matches the optimum bandgap (1.34 eV) of a single-junction solar cell, will result in further improvement in power conversion efficiency. However, it is challenging to deposit high-quality FAPbI(3 )in a 10-mu m-thick mesoporous scaffold due to the incomplete one-step conversion of perovskite precursors restrained in the mesoporous scaffold. Here we report printable perovskite solar cells with high-quality Cs(0.1)FA(0.9)PbI(3) absorber inside mesoporous scaffolds using a mixed solvent vapor assisted crystallization approach. A power conversion efficiency of 15% is obtained with a spectral response up to 840 nm. The phase transition and crystal growth of Cs(0.1)FAPbI(3) are carefully monitored in the mesoporous scaffold. This work not only opens up new methods for fabricating efficient and stable solar cells but also provides a deeper understanding of crystal growth inside constrained nanostructures.

One of the various approaches to increase the efficiency of PSCs is to change the material or structure of the carrier transport layer. Here, optically long and electrically short structural concept is proposed to enhance the characteristics of a PSC by employing selectively grown single crystalline TiO2 nanorods. The approach has the merit of increasing the electron-hole separation effectively and enables a thicker active layer to be coated without electrical loss by using TiO2 nanorods as an electron pathway. Moreover, selectively grown TiO2 nanorods increase the optical path of the incident light via scattering effects and enable a smooth coating of the active layer. Nanoimprint lithography and hydrothermal growth were employed to fabricate selectively grown TiO2 nanorod substrates. The fabricated solar cell exhibits an efficiency of 19.86% with a current density, open-circuit voltage, and fill factor of 23.13 mA/cm(2), 1.120 V, and 76.69%, respectively. Time-resolved photoluminescence, ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, and the incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) analysis were conducted to understand the factors responsible for the improvement in characteristics of the fabricated PSCs.

These perovskite films were aged at 200s before thermal annealing at 90 degrees C for 5min. Uniform perovskite films with lesser pinholes were obtained by this technique. The inverted planar (n-i-p) perovskite solar cell device resulted in a power conversion efficiency of 13%. A substantial finding was that the devices demonstrated high reproducibility. We also investigated the effect of annealing temperature on the optical and structural properties of the films and on the photovoltaic performances of the fabricated solar cell devices. For the aforementioned, a low-temperature, one-step solution process, the optimal temperature was achieved at 90 degrees C.

Here, we for the first time report on photodetectors based on few-layer MoS2 (n-type) and lead-free 2D perovskite (PEA)(2)SnI4 (p-type) heterostructures. The heterojunction device is capable of sensing light over the entire visible and near-infrared wavelength range with a tunable photoresponse peak. By using few-layer graphene flakes as the electrical contact, the performance of the heterostructures can be improved with a responsivity of 1100 A/W at 3 V bias, a fast response speed of similar to 40 ms under zero bias, and an excellent rectification ratio of 500. Importantly, the quantum efficiency can achieve 38.2% at zero bias, which is comparable or even higher than that of 3D perovskite/2D material photodetectors. Importantly, the spectral response peak of heterojunctions gradually shifts in a wide spectral range from the band edge of MoS2 toward that of (PEA)(2)SnI4 with the external bias.

Halide mixing is suggested as a powerful strategy toward stable perovskite materials. However, the stabilizing effect of the halides critically depends on their distribution in the mixed compound, a topic that is currently under intense debate. Here we successfully determine the exact location of the I and Cl anions in the CH3NH3PbBr3-yIy and CH3NH3PbBr3-zClz mixed halide perovskite lattices and correlate it with the enhanced stability we find for the latter. By combining scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory, we predict that, for low ratios, iodine and chlorine incorporation have different effects on the electronic properties and stability of the CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite material. In addition, we determine the optimal Cl incorporation ratio for stability increase without detrimental band gap modification, providing an important direction for the fabrication of stable perovskite devices. The increased material stability induced by chlorine incorporation is verified by performing photoelectron spectroscopy on a half-cell device architecture. Our findings provide an answer to the current debate on halide incorporation and demonstrate their direct influence on device stability.

Prospects for low-toxicity lead-free perovskite solar cells	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Editorial Material							HALIDE PEROVSKITES; TIN	Since the 2012 breakthroughs(1-3), it is now very much accepted that halide perovskite solar cells may have a strong practical impact in next-generation solar cells. The most efficient solar cells are using Pb-based halide perovskites. The presence of Pb in these devices, however, has caused some concerns due to the high perceived toxicity of Pb, which may slow down or even hinder the pace of commercialization. Therefore, the science community has been searching for lower-toxicity perovskite-type materials as a back-up strategy. The community is paying significant attention to Pb-free materials and has achieved promising results albeit not yet approaching the spectacular performance of APbI(3) materials. In this comment, we summarize the present status and future prospects for Pb-free perovskite materials and their devices.

Understanding the Formation of Vertical Orientation in Two-dimensional Metal Halide Perovskite Thin Films	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							X-RAY-DETECTORS; LEAD-IODIDE; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; LIGHT; EFFICIENT; ELECTRON; CATIONS; SPACE; NOISE	Metal halide perovskites have demonstrated strong potential for optoelectronic applications. Particularly, two-dimensional (2D) perovskites have emerged to be promising materials due to their tunable properties and superior stability compared to their three-dimensional counterparts. For high device performance, 2D perovskites need a vertical crystallographic orientation with respect to the electrodes to achieve efficient charge transport. However, the vertical orientation is difficult to achieve with various compositions due to a lack of understanding of the thin film nucleation and growth processes. Here we report a general crystallization mechanism for 2D perovskites, where solvent evaporation and crystal growth compete to influence the level of supersaturation and a low supersaturation is necessary to crystallize vertically oriented thin films starting from nucleation at the liquid-air interface. Factors influencing the supersaturation and crystallization dynamics, such as choices of organic spacers, solvents, and solvent drying rate, have a strong influence on the degree of crystallographic orientation. With this understanding of crystallization mechanism, we demonstrate direct crystallization of thin films with strong vertical orientation using three different organic spacers without any additives, and the vertically oriented 2D perovskites result in efficient and stable solar cell operation.

Comprehensive Elucidation of Ion Transport and Its Relation to Hysteresis in Methylammonium Lead Iodide Perovskite Thin Films	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							METAL-HALIDE PEROVSKITES; SOLAR-CELLS; MIGRATION; DEGRADATION	The "dark" current-voltage (I-V) response of CH3NH3PbI3 organic-inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP) thin films is studied as a function of temperature, voltage, and scan rate to investigate the nature of the I-V hysteresis. This is to address the apparent discrepancy observed in characteristics of the I-V hysteresis. Depending on the measurement conditions, two complementary mechanisms appear to control the I-V behavior. First, ionic species contribute to the conduction, and because of their slow-moving nature, a slower scan rate gives ions enough time to take part in conduction (i.e., below a relaxation frequency). Second, migration of ionic species to the interface(s) modulates the Schottky junction and, consequently, the electronic transport across the interfaces. Therefore, a slower scan rate results in 1 more charge accumulation at the interface, which leads to a decrease in the leakage current. These findings provide an explanation that resolves the ongoing debate regarding the characteristics of the I-V hysteresis in solar cells based on OIHPs.

We present here a vacuum-based study of the surface potential and response to illumination of two different types of perovskite films, methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr(3)) and the 2D Ruddlesden-Popper phase butylammonium lead iodide (BA(2)PbI(4), n = 1), using Kelvin probe-based contact potential difference and surface photovoltage measurements. We show that supraband gap light irradiation can induce the loss of halide species, which adsorb on the Kelvin probe tip, inducing quasi-irreversible changes of the MHP surface and tip work functions. If undetected, this can lead to misinterpretations of the MHP surface potential. Our results illustrate the effectiveness of the Kelvin probe-based technique in providing complementary information on the energetics of perovskite surfaces and the necessity to monitor the work function of the probe to avoid erroneous conclusions when working on these materials.

While every layer of a PSC has been shown to impact its durability in power output, the hole-transport layer (HTL) is critical for several reasons: (1) it is in direct contact with the perovskite layer, (2) it often contains mobile ions, like Li+-which in this case are hygroscopic, and (3) it usually has the lowest thermal stability of all layers in the stack. Therefore, HTL engineering is one method with a high return on investment for PSC stability and lifetime. Research has progressed in understanding design rules for small organic molecule hole-transport materials, yet, when implemented into devices, the same dopants, bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI) and tris(2-(1Hpyrazol- 1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine) cobalt(III) tri[ bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide] (FK209), are nearly always required for improved charge-transport properties (e. g., increased hole mobility and conductivity). The dopants are notable because they too have been shown to negatively impact PSC stability and lifetime. In response, new research has targeted alternative dopants to bypass these negative effects and provide greater functionality. In this review, we focus on dopant fundamentals, alternative doping strategies for organic small molecule HTL in PSC, and imminent research needs with regard to dopant development for the realization of reliable, long-lasting electricity generation via PSCs.

In this Perspective, we examine the effects of H2O, O-2, bias, temperature, and illumination on device performance and recovery. First, we discuss pivotal experiments that evaluate perovskites' ability to go through a reap-rest-recovery (3R) cycle, and how machine learning (ML) can help identify the optimum values for each operating parameter. Second, we analyze perovskite dynamics and degradation, emphasizing the research challenges surrounding this 3R cycle. We then outline experiments that could identify the impact of environmental factors on recovery for different perovskite compositions. Finally, we propose an ML paradigm for maximizing long-term performance and predicting device performance recovery, including a shared-knowledge repository. By reframing perovskites' optoelectronic transiency within the context of recovery rather than degradation, we highlight a set of research opportunities and the artificial intelligence solutions needed for the commercial adoption of these promising solar cell materials.

However, the spin-coating/antisolvent technique limits the device dimension due to film uniformity issues. Up to now, it has been challenging to obtain perovskite devices with high efficiency (e.g., >20%) using scalable methods without antisolvent steps. Herein, an air-blading process is demonstrated to assemble the entire perovskite devices completely free from the spin-coating techniques. This method can coat perovskite precursor on substrates and simultaneously induce nucleation in perovskite intermediate films without any antisolvent steps, leading to highly uniform films. The fully air-bladed perovskite photovoltaics shows the best efficiency (reverse scanning) of >20% for 0.09 cm(2) illumination-exposure area and the best efficiency of >19% for 1.0 cm(2) illumination-exposure area with high reproducibility (stabilized efficiencies are 19.3% and 18.2%, respectively). Such an air-blading process offers a wide processing window for versatile high-performance perovskite optoelectronics toward large-scale production.

Fullerene-Anchored Core-Shell ZnO Nanoparticles for Efficient and Stable Dual-Sensitized Perovskite Solar Cells	JOULE			English	Article							SURFACE FUNCTIONALIZATION; OXIDE NANOPARTICLES; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; TRANSPORTING LAYER; DIFFUSION LENGTHS; ROOM-TEMPERATURE; HIGHLY EFFICIENT; QUANTUM DOTS; ELECTRON; STABILITY	Among all the solutions to improve long-term stability of perovskite solar cells, p-i-n heterojunction with all-metal-oxide charge transporting layers show their attractive features. However, these devices require an efficient electron-transporting layer (ETL) fabricated on top of the perovskites in which the commonly used oxide nanocrystals are limited by their imperfect surface. Here, a novel surface-passivation strategy was adopted by anchoring ZnO nanoparticles with fullerene nano-shells (Fa-ZnO) to mitigate trap states and passivate surface hydroxyl groups. We evidence the Fa-ZnO can be easily processed on top of perovskite as a high-quality ETL that improves electron extraction efficiency and suppresses ion diffusion/moisture penetration. In addition, the presence of fullerene shells allows Fa-ZnO nanoparticles to penetrate into perovskite precursors before crystallization, resulting in n-type sensitized configuration. With mesoscopic NiOx as hole-collecting contact, the p-n dual sensitization configuration has enabled all-metal-oxide devices to achieve state-of-the-art efficiencies of 21.1% with greatly improved performance longevity.

The further pursuit of improved performance and stability will rely on a clear understanding of the fundamental properties of these materials. In this Feature Article, we outline a representative set of studies detailing how ultrafast laser spectroscopy can be used to access the optoelectronic properties and photophysical mechanisms of halide perovskites. Beginning with a concise synopsis of MHP history and structural properties, the dynamic processes in MHPs related to the photovoltaic performance are discussed. A brief overview of the representative time-resolved optical spectroscopic techniques in MHP research is then provided. Afterward, the recent advances in exploring the carrier, lattice, and spatially resolved dynamic processes in halide perovskite are summarized. The last section is devoted to a range of applications using halide perovskites. Finally, our conclusions and outlook for the field with some predictions for future opportunities round off this Feature Article.

Film conductivity was interrogated by measuring the in-phase and out-of-phase forces acting between the film and a charged microcantilever. We followed the films' conductivity versus time, frequency, light intensity, and temperature (233-312 K). Perovskite conductivity was high and light-independent over ITO and NiO. Over TiO2 and SnO2, the conductivity was low in the dark, increased with light intensity, and persisted for 10's of seconds after the light was removed. At an elevated temperature over TiO2, the rate of conductivity recovery in the dark showed an activated temperature dependence (E-a = 0.58 eV). Surprisingly, the light-induced conductivity over TiO2 and SnO2 relaxed essentially instantaneously at a low temperature. We use a transmission-line model for mixed ionic-electronic conductors to show that the measurements presented are sensitive to the sum of electronic and ionic conductivities. We rationalize the seemingly incongruous observations using the idea that holes, introduced either by equilibration with the substrate or via optical irradiation, create iodide vacancies.

Imaging Spatial Variations of Optical Bandgaps in Perovskite Solar Cells	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						bandgap; imaging; luminescence; perovskite; photovoltaic	ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; HIGH-EFFICIENCY; PHOTOLUMINESCENCE; LIGHT; SILICON; STABILITY; EMISSION; IMPACT; AREA	A fast, nondestructive, camera-based method to capture optical bandgap images of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with micrometer-scale spatial resolution is developed. This imaging technique utilizes well-defined and relatively symmetrical band-to-band luminescence spectra emitted from perovskite materials, whose spectral peak locations coincide with absorption thresholds and thus represent their optical bandgaps. The technique is employed to capture relative variations in optical bandgaps across various PSCs, and to resolve optical bandgap inhomogeneity within the same device due to material degradation and impurities. Degradation and impurities are found to both cause optical bandgap shifts inside the materials. The results are confirmed with micro-photoluminescence spectroscopy scans. The excellent agreement between the two techniques opens opportunities for this imaging concept to become a quantified, high spatial resolution, large-area characterization tool of PSCs. This development continues to strengthen the high value of luminescence imaging for the research and development of this photovoltaic technology.

Improved Efficiency and Stability of Pb/Sn Binary Perovskite Solar Cells Fabricated by Galvanic Displacement Reaction	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						galvanic displacement reaction; Pb/Sn binary perovskite; solar cells	FORMAMIDINIUM TIN IODIDE; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; NANOSTRUCTURES; REPLACEMENT; SN	Here, a simple and generally applicable method of fabricating efficient and stable Pb-Sn binary perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) based on a galvanic displacement reaction (GDR) is demonstrated. Different from the commonly used conventional approaches to form perovskite precursor solutions by mixing metal halides and organic halides such as PbI2, SnI2, MAI, FAI, etc., together, the precursor solutions are formulated by reacting pure Pb-based perovskite precursor solutions with fine Sn metal powders. After the ratios between Pb and Sn are optimized, high PCEs of 15.85% and 18.21% can be achieved for MAPb(0.4)Sn(0.6)I(3) and (FAPb(0.6)Sn(0.4)I(3))(0.85)(MAPb(0.6)Sn(0.4)Br(3))(0.15) based PVSCs, which are the highest PCEs among all values reported to date for Pb-Sn binary PVSCs. Moreover, the GDR perovskite-based PVSCs exhibit significantly improved ambient and thermal stability with encapsulation, which can retain more than 90% of their initial PCEs after being stored in ambient (relative humidity (RH) approximate to 50%) for 1000 h or being thermal annealed at 80 degrees C for more than 120 h in ambient conditions. These results demonstrate the advantage of using GDR to prepare tunable bandgap binary perovskites for devices with greatly improved performance and stability.

Although they are based on the nominally simple cubic perovskite structure, these compounds are in fact very complex. For example, in (CH3NH3) PbI3 the dynamics and ensuing structural fluctuations associated with the (CH3NH3)(+) ions and the interplay with the electronic properties are still not fully understood, despite extensive study. Here, using ab-initio calculations, we show that at room and higher temperature, the rotation of CH3NH3 molecules can be viewed as effectively giving local structures that are cubic and tetragonal like from the point of view of the PbI3 framework, though in fact having lower symmetry. Both of these structures are locally polar, with sizable polarization, similar to 10 mu C/cm(2) due to the dipoles on the organic. They become energetically degenerate in the volume range, V similar to 250 angstrom(3)/f. u-265 angstrom(3)/f. u. We also find very significant dependence of the band gap on the local structure. This type of transition is analogous to a transition between two ferroelectric structures, where in-spite of strong electron phonon coupling, there is strong screening of charged defects which can lead to enhanced mobility and charge collection. The results provide insights into the enhanced light absorption near the band edge and good charge collection in this material.

Passivation of defects at either surface or grain boundaries (GBs) thus promises great advances for developing high performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). By taking the co-passivation agent of 1H,1H-perfluorooctylamine (PFA) as the example, we present in this work a simple and effective surface & GB co-passivation strategy based on bifunctional molecules with fluorocarbon chains to achieve PSCs with highly improved photo-conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability. It was demonstrated that such a co-passivation strategy leads to 53.3% PCE enhancement in the MAPbI(3) type PSCs, as well as a champion PCE of 21.31% in CsFAMA type PSCs, and remarkable stability with 3% PCE loss after 2500 h of storage at a humidity of 70 +/- 5% at room temperature. Our results thus show the great potential of surface & GB co-passivation by fluorocarbon based molecules for accessing high performance PSCs based on the protocols of defect manipulation.

However, there is a lack of understanding of material crystallization in films and its influence on the morphological/optoelectronic properties and the final photovoltaic devices. Herein, we undertake in situ studies of the solidification process for ACI 2D perovskite (GA)(MA)(n)PbnI3n+1 (< n > = 3) from ink to solid-state semiconductor, using solvent mixture of DMSO:DMF (1:10 v/v) as the solvent and link this behavior to solar cell devices. The in situ grazing-incidence X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) analysis 4 reveals a complex journey through disordered sol gel precursors, intermediate phases, and ultimately to ACI perovskites. The intermediate phases, including a crystalline solvate compound and the 2D GA(2)PbI(4) perovskite, provide a scaffold for the growth of the ACI perovskites during thermal annealing. We identify 2D GA(2)PbI(4) to be the key intermediate phase, which is strongly influenced by the deposition technique and determines the formation of the 1D GAPbI(3) byproducts and the distribution of various n phases of ACI perovskites in the final films. We also confirm the presence of internal charge transfer between different n phases through transient absorption spectroscopy. The high quality ACI perovskite films deposited from solvent mixture of DMSO:DMF (1:10 v/v) deliver a record power conversion efficiency of 14.7% in planar solar cells and significantly enhanced long-term stability of devices in contrast to the 3D MAPbI(3) counterpart.

This synthetic route relies on a heavily Pb-rich condition or a large Pb:Cs molar ratio in precursor solution to produce QDs with appropriate stoichiometry as well as to guarantee a good colloidal stability. The high Pb condition is achieved by a high concentration of PbI2 prepared in TOP. Here we find such Pb-rich strategies can be avoided by providing additional iodine ions using other metal halide salts. In particular GeI2, which contrary to PbI2, readily dissolves in TOP. CsPbI3 QDs prepared using PbI2/GeI2 combination show near-unity PL QY and improved chemical stability compared to the previous synthetic route. Furthermore, we find no sign of Ge incorporation in the QDs (compositionally or energetically). The ensuing QD solar-cells deliver power conversion efficiency of 12.15% and retain 85% of its peak performance after storage over 90 days. The PbI2/GeI2 dual-source iodine synthetic approach presented here represents a more rational and robust route to high-quality CsPbI3 QDs.

Alloying, as for instance in InxGa1-xN, has been a mainstream strategy for tuning the bandgap. Keeping the semiconductor alloys in the miscibility gap (being homogeneous), however, is non-trivial. This challenge is now being extended to halide perovskites - an emerging class of photovoltaic materials. While the bandgap can be conveniently tuned by mixing different halogen ions, as in CsPb(BrxI1-x)(3), the so-called mixed-halide perovskites suffer from severe phase separation under illumination. Here, we discover that such phase separation can be highly suppressed by embedding nanocrystals of mixed-halide perovskites in an endotaxial matrix. The tuned bandgap remains remarkably stable under extremely intensive illumination. The agreement between the experiments and a nucleation model suggests that the size of the nanocrystals and the host-guest interfaces are critical for the photo-stability. The stabilized bandgap will be essential for the development of perovskite-based optoelectronics, such as tandem solar cells and full-color LEDs.

It is still a challenge to fabricate PSCs with long-time stability. The main threat to the long-time stability of PSCs is the water molecules in air that can decompose the perovskite film. It is reported that blocking the contact between moisture and perovskite is an effective way to mitigate the decomposition of perovskite and stabilize the performance of the solar cells. So in this study, we improved the moisture resistance of the hole transport layer (HTL) by using hydrophobic additive, 2,2',7,7'-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxy phenyl amine)-9,9'-spiro bifluorenedi[bis-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide] (Spiro-(TFSI)(2)), to substitute the lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) with hygroscopic nature. Pinholes in the HTL also have been eliminated dramatically after the Spiro-(TFSI)(2) has been introduced into the HTL, which contributes to the further enhancement of the moisture resistance. The champion solar cell based on the Spiro-(TFSI)(2) with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.1% has been obtained, and the results demonstrate that the performance stability has been improved dramatically via introducing the hydrophobic additive into the HTL. This work has provided an effective method to improve the performance stability of PSCs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Homogenized halides and alkali cation segregation in alloyed organic-inorganic perovskites	SCIENCE			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; HIGH-EFFICIENCY; HYBRID PEROVSKITES; FORMAMIDINIUM; PERFORMANCE; PHOTOVOLTAICS; HYSTERESIS	The role of the alkali metal cations in halide perovskite solar cells is not well understood. Using synchrotron-based nano-x-ray fluorescence and complementary measurements, we found that the halide distribution becomes homogenized upon addition of cesium iodide, either alone or with rubidium iodide, for substoichiometric, stoichiometric, and overstoichiometric preparations, where the lead halide is varied with respect to organic halide precursors. Halide homogenization coincides with long-lived charge carrier decays, spatially homogeneous carrier dynamics (as visualized by ultrafast microscopy), and improved photovoltaic device performance. We found that rubidium and potassium phase-segregate in highly concentrated clusters. Alkali metals are beneficial at low concentrations, where they homogenize the halide distribution, but at higher concentrations, they form recombination-active second-phase clusters.

Their remarkable photovoltaic performance is the effect of superior compositional engineering along with their unique optoelectronic properties. However, there is still a lack of understanding of the working principles of multi-cation based perovskite solar cells. In this study, we employ the state-of-the-art multiple-cation perovskites FA(0.83)MA(0.17)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)(3) and Cs-5(MA(0.17)FA(0.83))(95)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)(3) as absorber layers and investigate their intrinsic and interfacial dynamics in planar TiO2-based PSCs. We demonstrate that the incorporation of Cs+ in FA(0.83)MA(0.17)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)(3) leads to an increase in power conversion efficiency, improved perovskite phase stability and reduced recombination. However, these devices along with these excellent characteristics still suffer from lower open circuit voltage (V-oc) as compared to FA(0.83)MA(0.17)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)(3) based devices. By analysing the morphological properties and capacitance versus frequency responses, we show that the higher grain size and higher accumulation of photogenerated charges lead to the high open circuit voltage in FA(0.83)MA(0.17)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)(3) based devices. Our results demonstrate that the values of V-oc not only depend on the recombination, but also on charge accumulation phenomena.

Capillary-written single-crystalline all-inorganic perovskite microribbon arrays for highly-sensitive and thermal-stable photodetectors	NANOSCALE			English	Article							CESIUM LEAD HALIDE; SOLAR-CELLS; OPTOELECTRONIC PROPERTIES; PERFORMANCE; EFFICIENT; NANOWIRES; STABILITY; TRANSPORT; FACETS; GROWTH	In recent times, as a result of its exceptional resistance to moisture and heat, cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) has been established as a potential high-performance perovskite material for optoelectronics, which is inclusive of photodetectors and photovoltaics. It has been demonstrated that a perovskite single crystal has major benefits over its thin-film equivalents; nevertheless, the preparation of perovskite crystal arrays for the utilisation of extensive integration is a challenging task. In this paper, we consider a simple crystallisation system, being a capillary-written system to enable the growth of single crystal microribbon arrays (MRAs) directly from a precursor solution. It is demonstrated by microstructure characterisation that CsPbBr3 MRAs are good-quality single crystals with highly-aligned crystal packing and smooth surfaces. The band-edge photoluminescence (PL) is exceptionally resilient and has a lengthy PL life of approximate to 62 ns. An exceptional photo-response having a particularly quick 99 s response time and a 2496 A W-1 ultra-high responsivity is exhibited by photodetectors which are built upon these MRAs. The fact that the as-fabricated photodetectors maintain 90% of their commencing performance following 100 days of constant stress testing under ambient conditions under an illumination of 450 nm, showing exceptional operational stability, is noteworthy. A significant step towards the large-area growth of high-quality perovskite MRAs is presented by this work. This supplies favourable opportunities to build high-performance optoelectronic and nanophotonic systems.	[Zhao, Xiaoming; Shi, Wenda; Hou, Xueyan; Dennis, T.

It remains unclear how 2D exciton and charge separation properties can be utilized to further enhance the performance of perovskite materials for optoelectrical applications. Herein, we report a study of exciton and interfacial charge-transfer dynamics of CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets via transient absorption spectroscopy. The exciton binding energy (similar to 260 meV) is determined via detailed spectral analysis. The exciton bleach is caused by band-edge exciton state-filling with negligible single carrier (electron or hole) contributions. Efficient charge separation can be achieved by selective electron and hole transfers to adsorbed molecular acceptors (benzoquinone and phenothiazine, respectively), and the half-life of the charge-separated state (>> 100 ns) in nanoplatelet-phenothiazine complexes is >100 fold longer than that in quantum dot-phenothiazine complexes. Our results suggest that CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets are promising materials for photocatalysis and photovoltaic applications.

However, the understanding of the correlation between architecture and carrier dynamics in perovskite thin films has remained elusive. In this work, we utilize concerted materials characterization and optical measurements to investigate the role of chloride addition in PSC devices with two different architectures. Perovskite thin films, prepared with varying ratios of methylammonium halide MACE : MAI (0 : 1, 0.5 : 1, 1 : 1, and 2 : 1), were coated on either planar or mesoporous TiO2/FTO substrates. X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that with increasing the ratio of the CF precursor, there is an increasing preferential directional growth of the perovskite film in both configurations. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy was applied to investigate the electron injection dynamics from the photoexcited perovskites to the TiO2. It is found that the interfacial electron injection rate from perovskite to planar TiO2 is accelerated with increasing Cl- content, which explains the increased power conversion efficiencies using Cl--modified perovskites as photoactive materials. In contrast, Cl- addition demonstrate no discernable influence on electron injection to mesoporous TiO2 , suggesting the interfacial charge recombination rather than electron injection give rise to the improved performance observed in the mesoporous configuration. The results presented here, provide a deeper understanding of the mechanism of chloride addition to MAPbI(3) solar cells with different architectures.

Cesium-Incorporated Triple Cation Perovskites Deliver Fully Reversible and Stable Nanoscale Voltage Response	ACS NANO			English	Article						perovskite solar cells; MAPbI(3); MAPbBr(3); Cs-mixed perovskite; ion motion; nanoscale voltage; Kelvin probe force microscopy	SOLAR-CELLS; ION MIGRATION; LEAD IODIDE; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; SEGREGATION; STABILITY; FORMAMIDINIUM; SUBSTITUTION; DEGRADATION; TRANSPORT	Perovskite solar cells that incorporate small concentrations of Cs in their A-site have shown increased lifetime and improved device performance. Yet, the development of fully stable devices operating near the theoretical limit requires understanding how Cs influences perovskites electrical properties at the nanoscale. Here, we determine how the chemical composition of three perovskites (MAPbBr(3), MAPbI(3), and Cs-mixed) affects their short- and long-term voltage stabilities, with <50 nm spatial resolution. We map an anomalous irreversible electrical signature on MAPbBr(3) at the mesoscale, resulting in local V-oc variations of similar to 400 mV, and in entire grains with negative contribution to the V-oc. These measurements prove the necessity of high spatial resolution mapping to elucidate the fundamental limitations of this emerging material. Conversely, we capture the fully reversible voltage response of Cs-mixed perovskites, composed by Cs-0.06(MA(0.17)FA(0.83))(0.94)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)(3), demonstrating that the desired electrical output persists even at the nanoscale.

Charge extraction via graded doping of hole transport layers gives highly luminescent and stable metal halide perovskite devices	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							FIELD-EFFECT TRANSISTORS; SOLAR-CELLS; TRIPLET EXCITONS; INTERFACE; STABILITY; TETRACENE; EFFICIENT; PERFORMANCE; DEGRADATION; PENTACENE	One source of instability in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is interfacial defects, particularly those that exist between the perovskite and the hole transport layer (HTL). We demonstrate that thermally evaporated dopant-free tetra-cene (120 nm) on top of the perovskite layer, capped with a lithium-doped Spiro-OMeTAD layer (200 nm) and top gold electrode, offers an excellent hole-extracting stack with minimal interfacial defect levels. For a perovskite layer interfaced between these graded HTLs and a mesoporous TiO2 electron-extracting layer, its photoluminescence yield reaches 15% compared to 5% for the perovskite layer interfaced between TiO2 and Spiro-OMeTAD alone. For PSCs with graded HTL structure, we demonstrate efficiency of up to 21.6% and an extended power output of over 550 hours of continuous illumination at AM1.5G, retaining more than 90% of the initial performance and thus validating our approach. Our findings represent a breakthrough in the construction of stable PSCs with minimized nonradiative losses.	[Abdi-Jalebi, Mojtaba; Dar, M.

However, the detailed interaction between water and 3D/2D perovskite heterojunctions has not been elucidated yet. Using in situ neutron and X-ray scattering techniques, we reveal surprisingly strong water uptake into 3D/2D perovskite films despite the presence of hydrophobic bulky cations. Our results show rapid disproportionation of the initial 2D phase (number of layers, m = 5) in methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI)/2D films into lower m phases under humidity. Nevertheless, the 2D perovskite inhibits the irreversible PbI2 formation, which suggests that the suppression of land MA(+) ion migration and consequently of MAI escape is related to the improved moisture stability of MAPI/2D perovskite films. In comparison, quadruple-cation perovskites including Rb+ exhibit poor stability toward phase segregation upon exposure to moisture regardless of the 2D perovskite layer.

The DSSC efficiency is higher than that (7.96%) of a DSSC with a standard Pt counter electrode. Furthermore, it was found that the electrical conductivity of 3DMG played a critical role in the PSC, but the DSSC performance was dependent on both its surface area and electrical conductivity. This would provide a novel approach to synthesize ideal electrode materials for energy devices.

Lattice strain causes non-radiative losses in halide perovskites	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; LEAD IODIDE; THIN-FILMS; CARRIERS; LUMINESCENCE; LIFETIMES	Halide perovskites are promising semiconductors for inexpensive, high-performance optoelectronics. Despite a remarkable defect tolerance compared to conventional semiconductors, perovskite thin films still show substantial microscale heterogeneity in key properties such as luminescence efficiency and device performance. However, the origin of the variations remains a topic of debate, and a precise understanding is critical to the rational design of defect management strategies. Through a multi-scale investigation - combining correlative synchrotron scanning X-ray diffraction and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements on the same scan area - we reveal that lattice strain is directly associated with enhanced defect concentrations and non-radiative recombination. The strain patterns have a complex heterogeneity across multiple length scales. We propose that strain arises during the film growth and crystallization and provides a driving force for defect formation. Our work sheds new light on the presence and influence of structural defects in halide perovskites, revealing new pathways to manage defects and eliminate losses.

Here, an effective and practical method is demonstrated to overcome the device stability issues in PSCs. A CF4 plasma treatment method is developed that results in the formation of a robust C-F-x layer covering the PSC device, thereby, imparting protection during the operation of solar cell. PSCs exposed to fluorination process showed excellent stability against water, light, and oxygen, displaying relatively no noticeable degradation after being dipped into water for considerable time period. The fluorination process did not have any impact on the morphology and electrical property of the top Spiro-OMeTAD layer, resulting in a conversion efficiency of 18.7%, which is identical to that of the pristine PSC. Under the continuous Xe lamp (AM 1.5G, 1 sun) illumination in ambient air for 100 h, the fluorinated PSCs demonstrated 70% of initial conversion efficiency, which is 4000% higher than that of the pristine PSC devices. We believe this breakthrough will have significant impact on the transition of PSCs into real world applications.

The excellent performance of PSCs is attributed to the superior electrical properties of each layer, including the electron transport layer (ETL), light-harvest layer, hole transport layer. As one of the most promising ETL materials for PSCs, SnO2 shows excellent transmission, an appropriate energy band gap, a deep conduction band level, and high electron mobility, leading to efficient electron extraction and transport. Here, recent advancements in the PSCs with SnO2 ETLs and endeavors aimed at improving the performance of this photovoltaic device are reviewed. Several typical configurations of SnO2 based PSCs are discussed, including the planar structure, mesoporous structure, inverted structure and flexible PSCs. The efforts of modification and composite SnO2 with other metal oxides are also assessed. Finally, an overview of the perspectives and challenges for the future of SnO2 based PSCs is provided.

In this work, we apply a machine learning technique to study the trend of reactivity of different types of amines, which are used for the post-treatment of organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite films. Fifty amines are classified based on their compatibility with the methylammonium lead iodide films. Machine learning models are constructed from the classification of these amines and their molecular descriptor features. The model has achieved 86% accuracy on predicting the outcomes of whether perovskite films are maintained after post-treatment. By analyzing the constructed models, it was found that amines with fewer hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, more steric bulk, secondary, tertiary amines, and pyridine derivatives tend to have high compatibility with perovskite films.

Recently, a triarylamine-based organic hole-transport material (HTM) doped with its oxidized salt analogue (EH44/EH44-ox) led to unencapsulated PSCs with high stability in ambient conditions. Here we report criteria for triarylamine-based organic HTMs formulated with stable oxidized salts as hole-transport layer (HTL) for increased PSC thermal stability. The triarylamine-based dopants must contain at least two para-electron-donating groups for radical cation stabilization to prevent impurity formation that leads to reduced PSC performance. The stability of unencapsulated devices prepared using these new HTMs stressed under constant load and illumination far outperforms that of both EH44/EH44-ox and Li+-doped spiro-OMeTAD controls at 50 degrees C. Furthermore, the ability to mix and match these dopants with a nonidentical small-molecule-based HTL matrix broadens the design scope for highly stable and cost-effective PSCs without sacrificing performance.

In such a "wearable wristband", the harvested solar energy can either directly drive the sensor and power up a light-emitting diode as a warning signal, or can be stored in the supercapacitors in a standby mode, and the energy released from supercapacitors can compensate the intermittency of light illumination. To the best of our knowledge, the demonstration of such a self-powered sensor system integrated onto a single piece of flexible substrate in a printable and additive manner has not previously been reported. Particularly, the printable supercapacitors deliver an areal capacitance of 12.9 mF cm(-2) and the printed SnO2 gas sensor shows remarkable detection sensitivity under room temperature. The printable strategies for device fabrication and system integration developed here show great potency for scalable and facile fabrication of a variety of wearable devices.

In this paper, humidity-insensitive fabrication (HIF) of efficient CH3NH2PbI3 (MAPbI(3)) PSCs using an antisolvent method is demonstrated. Characterizations including scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-vis absorption and steady-state photoluminescence (PL) of the MAPbI(3) films prepared in a glovebox(similar to 0% RH) and 50% RH ambient air using the antisolvent method are carried out. The quality of the MAPbI(3) films shows no obvious difference in these two cases. By analyzing the crystallization processes, the greatly suppressed influence of humidity is ascribed to the rapid crystallization process due to the antisolvent method. The photovoltaic performances and storage stability of MAPbI(3) PSCs prepared at a series of relative humidity (RH) levels below 60% are found similar. Their average power conversion efficiency (PCE) is over 15% with the best PCE of 16.9%. In addition, the influence of absorbed water in the hydrophilic precursor to MAPbI(3) films and associated solar cells is investigated. The influence of equal molar absorbance of H2O is found ignorable. It is concluded that anti solvent method is an ideal HIF route for fabrication of efficient PSCs in ambient air and may pave the way for massive and low-cost manufacturing of solar panels.

Owing to perovskites' low nucleation and crystallization activation energy (56.6-97.3 kJ mol(-1)), a range of low temperature and large-scale solution fabrication processes have been actively investigated for potential commercialization. Although many excellent research institutes and enterprises have emerged to advance commercialization of PSCs, the performance of devices which have large areas still lag much farther behind those of smaller lab scales. The performances of PSCs are predominantly determined by the quality of the perovskite film, which in turn, is controlled by the fabrication process. A comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the nucleation and growth process during perovskite crystallization is imperative for the further advancement of large-scale manufacturing of high quality perovskite films. This review summarizes recent advances in the commercialization of the PSCs market, and critically reviews promising large-scale solution manufacturing methods combined with their physical properties and relevant challenges with the crystallization thermodynamics and kinetics of perovskites. The hurdles and challenges of commercialization and possible approaches and solutions are discussed.

The phase composition and orientation of the CH3NH3PbI3 phase was tuned through control of the aging time. This lead to high-performance CH3NH3PbI3 planar perovskite solar cells with power conversion efficiency over 16%. The intermediate phase composition was sensitive to the ambient atmosphere. The content of the PbI2 in the final CH3NH3PbI3 films varied with precursor aging time. The combination of nitrogen flow and suitable aging time resulted in films with enhanced (110)-orientation, compactness, charge carrier lifetimes, and correspondingly power conversion efficiencies.

Though small molecule-based additives have proven to be effective defect passivating agents, their high volatility and diffusivity cannot render perovskite films robust enough against harsh environments. Here we suggest design rules for effective molecules by considering their molecular structure. From these, we introduce a strategy to form macromolecular intermediate phases using long chain polymers, which leads to the formation of a polymer-perovskite composite cross-linker. The cross-linker functions to bridge the perovskite grains, minimizing grain-to-grain electrical decoupling and yielding excellent environmental stability against moisture, light, and heat, which has not been attainable with small molecule defect passivating agents. Consequently, all photovoltaic parameters are significantly enhanced in the solar cells and the devices also show excellent stability.

However, processing temperatures of up to 450 degrees C are typically required to sinter mesoporous metal-oxide scaffolds, which hinders the fabrication of low-cost and flexible devices. Moreover, these metal-oxide scaffolds usually suffer from high charge carrier recombination rates and inherent UV instability. In this paper, we develop for the first time an organic-scaffold architecture, which consists of room-temperature-processed C-60 single-crystalline nanoparticles (C-60-NPs) serving as an electron selective contact covering on C-60 compact films (c-C-60). C-60-NPs act as a three-dimensional framework to support perovskite crystals, enabling them to cover the substrate more uniformly and thus demonstrating an advantage over planar heterojunction PSCs. Furthermore, the higher electron mobility of C-60-NPs compared with commonly used TiO2 enhances the charge transfer from the perovskite to electron transport layers and reduces charge carrier accumulation at the interface, demonstrating the advantage of an organic scaffold over inorganic metal-oxides for mesoporous scaffold PSCs. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.45% was obtained in organic-scaffold MAPbI(3)-based perovskite solar cells (OPSCs), outperforming standard reference devices based on a TiO2 mesoporous scaffold (maximum PCE = 17.07%). Furthermore, the high UV stability of C-60-NPs enables the realisation of ultra-stable OPSCs stressed under ambient conditions and working under both UV and full-sun illumination. Moreover, the devices can be easily processed at low temperatures, providing an efficient method for the large-scale production of flexible PSCs. These flexible PSCs show remarkable performance with an excellent PCE of 17.28%, which is among the highest values reported for MAPbI(3)-based flexible PSCs to date. This work reveals that organic nanostructures as n-type charge collection layers are ideal replacements for inorganic mesoporous scaffolds as they achieve remarkably high efficiency and long-term operational stability in both rigid and flexible perovskite solar cells.

With excellent morphology and interfacial contact due to its elastomeric and amphiphilic properties, the BEDCE layer at the perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD interface in PSCs significantly improves the short-circuit current and fill factor, enhancing the efficiency from 17.20% to 19.02%. Besides, the first solution-processed non-doped greenish-yellow OLEDs based on elastomeric BEDCE show efficiency and luminance of 4.56 cd A(-1) and 10320 cd m(-2), respectively, which are among the highest performances. Thus, to the best of our knowledge, BEDCE is the first multi-functional material to be utilized in both OLEDs and PSCs with good performances, showing its promising potential applications for various devices.

Structure and chemical stability in perovskitepolymer hybrid photovoltaic materials	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; THIN-FILMS; EFFICIENCY; FORMAMIDINIUM; ADDITIVES	Adding polymers to methylammonium lead iodide perovskite solar cell active layers has been previously shown to increase their chemical stability, but stabilization mechanisms in these hybrid materials are poorly understood. We report here on a structural and spectroscopic analysis in a number of perovskite-polymer hybrid materials and compare their stability. We observed that perovskite crystallite sizes decrease with the addition of polymers (polyethylene glycol, polyethyleneimine, poly(acrylic acid) and polyvinylpyrrolidone), and through the use of nanomechanical AFM showed phase contrast in the perovskite-polymer mixture. NMR and single-crystal growth experiments reveal that acid-base interactions, as well as facet-dependent interfacial interactions between perovskite and polymer, contribute to differences in stabilities of these hybrid materials. The polymers investigated tend to suppress the formation of a hydrate crystal phase that accelerates the degradation reaction, and we report that adding poly(acrylic acid) increases significantly the stability of perovskite films under humid air and ambient illumination. Under these controlled degradation conditions, perovskite-poly(acrylic acid) hybrid solar cells maintain stable efficiency for the first 3 days and then slowly degrade over the next 6 days under humid air and illumination, whereas control perovskite solar cells degrade entirely within the first 2 days. These results highlight the importance of choosing suitable functional groups in the polymer phase of perovskite hybrid solar cells to prolong their device lifetime.

Melting temperature suppression of layered hybrid lead halide perovskites via organic ammonium cation branching	CHEMICAL SCIENCE			English	Article							WHITE-LIGHT EMISSION; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; INORGANIC PEROVSKITES; SOLAR-CELLS; BAND-GAP; EFFICIENT; IODIDE; (CNH2N+1NH3)(2)PBI4; PERFORMANCE; TIN	Hybrid organic-inorganic lead halide perovskites have attracted broad interest because of their unique optical and electronic properties, as well as good processability. Thermal properties of these materials, often overlooked, can provide additional critical information for developing new methods of thin film preparation using, for example, melt processing-i.e., making films of hybrid perovskites by solidification of a thin layer of the melt liquid. We demonstrate that it is possible to tune the melting temperature of layered hybrid lead iodide perovskites over the range of more than 100 degrees by modifying the structures of alkylammonium-derived organic cations. Through the introduction of alkyl chain branching and extending the length of the base alkylammonium cation, melting temperatures of as low as 172 degrees C can be achieved and high quality thin films of layered hybrid lead iodide perovskites can be made using a solvent-free melt process with no additives and in ambient air. Additionally, we show that a similar concept can be translated to the corresponding layered bromides, with slightly higher observed melting temperatures. The design rules established here can guide the discovery of new melt-processable perovskite materials for low-cost high performance devices.

In this study, postsynthesis nanocrystal fusion, aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, and first-principles calculations are combined to study the nature of different planar defects formed in CsPbBr3 nanocrystals. Two types of prevalent planar defects from atomic resolution imaging are observed: previously unreported Br-rich [001](210) n-ary sumation 5 grain boundaries (GBs) and Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) planar faults. The first-principles calculations reveal that neither of these planar faults induce deep defect levels, but their Br-deficient counterparts do. It is found that the n-ary sumation 5 GB repels electrons and attracts holes, similar to an n-p-n junction, and the RP planar defects repel both electrons and holes, similar to a semiconductor-insulator-semiconductor junction. Finally, the potential applications of these findings and their implications to understand the planar defects in organic-inorganic lead-halide perovskites that have led to solar cells with extremely high photoconversion efficiencies are discussed.

However, there is a lack of study of their stability under operational conditions. Here a stability study of perovskite solar cells under gamma-rays and visible light simultaneously is reported. The perovskite active layers are shown to retain 96.8% of their initial power conversion efficiency under continuous irradiation of gamma-rays and light for 1535 h, where gamma-rays have an accumulated dose of 2.3 Mrad. In striking contrast, a glass substrate shows obvious loss of transmittance under the same irradiation conditions. The excellent stability of the perovskite solar cells benefits from the self-healing behavior to recover its efficiency loss from the early degradation induced by gamma-ray irradiation. Defect density characterization reveals that gamma-ray irradiation does not induce electronic trap states. These observations demonstrate the prospects of perovskite materials in applications of radiation detectors and space solar cells.

To the best of the authors' knowledge, this represents the highest efficiency that has so far been reported for perovskite solar cells using a 2D electron transporting layer. The large-scaled 2D multilayer SnS2 sheet structure triggers a heterogeneous nucleation over the perovskite precursor film. The intermolecular Pb center dot center dot center dot S interactions between perovskite and SnS2 could passivate the interfacial trap states, which suppress charge recombination and thus facilitate electron extraction for balanced charge transport at interfaces between electron transporting layer/perovskite and hole transporting layer/perovskite. This work demonstrates that 2D materials have great potential for high-performance perovskite solar cells.

Here, the well-crystallized mixed-cation lead mixed-halide perovskite films with the optimized composition of FA(0.85)MA(0.15)Pb-(I0.8Br0.2)(3) were achieved by antisolvent-assisted single-step spin-coating in ambient conditions. The resulting PSCs with the well-crystallized FA(0.85)MA(0.15)Pb(I0.8Br0.2)(3) exhibit impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 20% under standard AM 1.5 illumination with excellent reproducibility. Remarkably, no perceivable degradation in PCE was detected from the PSCs stored in ambient conditions without any encapsulation after 7000 h (nearly 300 days), which was among the best shelf stability ever reported for PSCs. The superior performance was mainly attributed to the improved structural quality of the FA(0.85)MA(0.15)Pb(I0.8Br0.2)(3) layer with reduced grain boundaries, reduced trap-state density, and prolonged carrier lifetime, as well as the better intrinsic stability of the mixed perovskite with an optimized composition.

Two-Dimensional Hybrid Halide Perovskites: Principles and Promises	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Review							ORGANIC-INORGANIC PEROVSKITES; WHITE-LIGHT EMISSION; CESIUM LEAD HALIDE; 3RD-ORDER OPTICAL NONLINEARITY; TO-BLACK PIEZOCHROMISM; HOLE-CONDUCTOR-FREE; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; SOLAR-CELLS; BAND-GAP	Hybrid halide perovskites have become the "next big thing" in emerging semiconductor materials, as the past decade witnessed their successful application in high-performance photovoltaics. This resurgence has encompassed enormous and widespread development of the three-dimensional (3D) perovskites, spearheaded by CH3NH3PbI3. The next generation of halide perovskites, however, is characterized by reduced dimensionality perovskites, emphasizing the two-dimensional (2D) perovskite derivatives which expand the field into a more diverse subgroup of semiconducting hybrids that possesses even higher tunability and excellent photo physical properties. In this Perspective, we begin with a historical flashback to early reports before the "perovskite fever", and we follow this original work to its fruition in the present day, where 2D halide perovskites are in the spotlight of current research, offering characteristics desirable in high-performance optoelectronics. We approach the evolution of 2D halide perovskites from a structural perspective, providing a way to classify the diverse structure types of the materials, which largely dictate the unusual physical properties observed. We sort the 2D hybrid halide perovskites on the basis of two key components: the inorganic layers and their modification, and the organic cation diversity. As these two heterogeneous components blend, either by synthetic manipulation (shuffling the organic cations or inorganic elements) or by application of external stimuli (temperature and pressure), the modular perovskite structure evolves to construct crystallographically defined quantum wells (QWs). The complex electronic structure that arises is sensitive to the structural features that could be in turn used as a knob to control the dielectric and optical properties the QWs. We conclude this Perspective with the most notable achievements in optoelectronic devices that have been demonstrated to date, with an eye toward future material discovery and potential technological developments.

Here, pressure (0-10 GPa) was applied to 2D hybrid perovskite flakes mechanically exfoliated from butylammonium lead halide single crystals, (C4H9NH3)(2)PbI4, from which we observed a series of changes of the strong excitonic emissions in the photoluminescence spectra. By correlating with in situ high-pressure X-ray diffraction results, we examine successfully the relationship between structural modifications in the inorganic PbI42- layer and their excitonic properties. During the transition between Pbca (1b) phase and Pbca (1a) phase at around 0.1 GPa, the decrease in < Pb-I-Pb > bond angle and increase in Pb-I bond length lead to an abrupt blue shift of the excitonic bandgap. The presence of the P2(1)/a phase above 1.4 GPa increases the < Pb-I-Pb > bond angle and decreases the Pb-I bond length, leading to a deep red shift of the excitonic bandgap. The total band gap narrowing of similar to 350 meV to 2.03 eV at 5.3 GPa before amorphization, facilitates (C4H9NH3)(2)PbI4 as a much better solar absorber. Moreover, phase transitions inevitably modify the carrier lifetime of (C4H9NH3)(2)PbI4, where an initial 150 ps at ambient phase is prolongated to 190 ps in the Pbca (1) phase along with enhanced photoluminescence (PL), originating from pressure-induced strong radiative recombination of trapped excitons.The onset of P2(1)/a phase shortens significantly the carrier lifetime to 53 ps along with a weak PL emission due to pressure-induced severe lattice distortion and amorphization. High-pressure study on (C4H9NH3)(2)PbI4 nm-thin flakes may provide insights into the mechanisms for synthetically designing novel 2D hybrid perovskite based photoelectronic devices and solar cells.

Polar-Solvent-Free Synthesis of Highly Photoluminescent and Stable CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals with Controlled Shape and Size by Ultrasonication	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							CESIUM LEAD HALIDE; LIGAND-MEDIATED SYNTHESIS; DEPENDENT STOKES SHIFT; PEROVSKITE NANOCRYSTALS; QUANTUM DOTS; INORGANIC PEROVSKITE; CSPBX3; LUMINESCENT; STABILITY; MECHANISM	In this work, we report a polar-solvent-free, low-cost, and environmentally friendly method for synthesizing highly stable all-inorganic CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (NCs). Their shape and size are controlled by adjusting key parameters in the synthesis, such as capping ligands as well as ultrasound power and radiation time. The CsPbBr3 NCs are tunable from three-dimensional to two-dimensional and finally to 0-dimensional, by controlling the ratios and types of capping ligands. The CsPbBr3 NCs exhibit optical properties dependent on their shape and size, with photoluminescence quantum yield as high as 83%. Moreover, the role of nonpolar solvents in improving the stability of the CsPbBr3 NCs and the mechanism for the tunable growth of CsPbBr3 NCs are studied and discussed. Controlled shape and size of perovskite NCs are desired for applications, including solar cells, lasers, light-emitting diodes, and solar concentrators.

H. Miao, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2017, 139, 11125-11131]. For these applications, excellent contact performance between m-InP3 and the electrodes is vital. In this work, by first-principles calculations, the electronic structures of m-InP3 in contact with graphene (G) and Ni are investigated and the contact characters are further tuned by inserting a buffer layer, e.g., a G or BN monolayer (m-BN) along with the introduction of intrinsic P- and In-vacancy defects. For m-InP3 in contact with G, inserting an m-BN can alter the contact character from an n-type to a p-type Schottky contact. This is consistent with the prediction of the Schottky-Mott rule, indicating that Fermi level pinning is removed in the interface. However, for the contact with Ni, if an m-BN or G is inserted into the interface, an n-type Ohmic contact is obtained, rather than the p-type Schottky one based on the Schottky-Mott rule. We attribute this inconsistency to the effect of electron transfer from m-BN or G to Ni, which leads to a decreased work function for Ni. Additionally, introducing In- and P-vacancy defects can reduce the Schottky barrier in the interfaces between m-InP3 and G or Ni. Moreover, if m-BN is inserted into these defect-containing interfaces, an n-type Ohmic contact could be achieved and dominate the contact character. Our results offer deeper insights into factors such as the Fermi level pinning on the band alignment of the interfaces between m-InP3 and G or Ni, and how the contact characters are improved by inserting a buffer layer along with the introduction of In- and P-vacancy defects.

By analyzing dark-current density and distribution, it is identified that charge recombination at grain boundaries is a key factor limiting the performance of low-bandgap mixed Sn-Pb halide perovskite subcells. It is further found that bromine (Br) incorporation can effectively passivate grain boundaries and lower the dark current density by two-three orders of magnitude. By optimizing the Br concentration, low-bandgap (1.272 eV) mixed Sn-Pb halide perovskite solar cells are fabricated with open-circuit voltage deficits as low as 0.384 V and fill factors as high as 75%. The best-performing device demonstrates a PCE of >19%. The results suggest an important direction for improving the performance of low-bandgap mixed Sn-Pb halide perovskite solar cells.

However, the charge transfer kinetics mediated by its surface state remains unclear. Here, the charge transfer mechanism of Cs2SnI6 is reported and the role of its surface state in the presence of a redox mediator is clarified. Specifically, charge transfer through the surface state of Cs2SnI6 and its subsequent surface state charging are demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry and Mott-Schottky measurements, respectively. Because it is expected that the surface state of Cs2SnI6 is capable of regenerating oxidized organic dyes, a Cs2SnI6-based regenerator is developed for a dye-sensitized solar cell composed of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/dyed mesoporous TiO2/regenerator/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/FTO. As expected, the performance of the Cs2SnI6-based regenerator is strongly dependent on the highest occupied molecular orbital of the dyes. Consequently, Cs2SnI6 shows efficient charge transfer with a thermodynamically favorable charge acceptor level, achieving a 79% enhancement in the photocurrent density (14.1 mA cm(-2)) compared with that of a conventional liquid electrolyte (7.9 mA cm(-2)). The results suggest that the surface state of Cs2SnI6 is the main charge transfer pathway in the presence of a redox mediator and should be considered in future designs of Cs2SnI6-based devices.

Herein, we show that a combination of two additives, MACl and MAH(2)PO(2), in the perovskite precursor can significantly improve the grain morphology of wide-bandgap (1.64-1.70 eV) perovskite films, resulting in solar cells with increased photocurrent while reducing the open-circuit voltage deficit to 0.49-0.51 V. The addition of MACl enlarges the grain size, while MAH(2)PO(2) reduces non-radiative recombination through passivation of the perovskite grain boundaries, with good synergy of functions from MACl and MAH(2)PO(2). Matching the photocurrent between the two subcells in a perovskite/silicon monolithic tandem solar cell by using a bandgap of 1.64 eV for the top cell results in a high tandem V-oc of 1.80 V and improved power conversion efficiency of 25.4%.

The optimized perovskite films show high crystallinity with large grains in the mu m-range and reveals phase stability due to the presence of MACI after the annealing process.

The optimization of TiO2 nanostructures has been proved to be an effective approach for efficient PSCs. On the other hand, tuning the crystallization of perovskite films on top of the TiO2 NA is very important for efficient TiO2-NA based PSCs. Herein, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) were used to study the crystallization of different mixed-ion Cs-0.1(FA(0.83)MA(0.17))(0.9)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)(3) perovskite (in which MA = CH3NH3+ and FA = CH(NH2)(2)(+)) films, from different perovskite precursor concentrations, on the TiO2 nanorod arrays. A mechanism was proposed to reveal the inherent connection between the precursor concentration and the crystallite growth of the perovskite film prepared with anti solvent quenching process. Meanwhile, both faster charge separation at perovskite/TiO2 NA interface and longer charge transport were observed on thicker perovskite film with larger grains, revealed by the time-resolved method. However, atomic force microscopy (AFM) results indicated that too thick perovskite film impaired the charge collection owing to the increased recombination. By balancing the charge collection and film thickness, highly efficient PSC5 were prepared with a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.33% with little hysteresis.

Revealing lattice and photocarrier dynamics of high-quality MAPbBr(3) single crystals by far infrared reflection and surface photovoltage spectroscopy	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							HALIDE PEROVSKITES; DIFFUSION LENGTHS; CARRIER DIFFUSION; OPTICAL PHONONS; SOLAR-CELLS; TRANSPORT	Hybrid organic-inorganic lead halide perovskite materials show great promise in a number of optoelectronic applications, including solar cells, light emitting diodes, and photodetectors. Understanding their intrinsic material properties is critical to enhancing device performance and enabling innovative material and device designs. Here, we study lattice dynamics using far infrared (FIR) reflectance and photogenerated carrier dynamics using surface photovoltage (SPV) measurements on high-quality methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr(3)) single crystals. FIR reflectance shows three coherent infrared-active phonon modes between 40 and 200 cm(-1) that result in reststrahlen bands with much higher peak reflectance than has been previously reported. The phonon mode strength and damping are comparable to classical oxide perovskite single crystals. However, the effects of defects on photogenerated carrier recombination are still evident in SPV measurements. By performing SPV over different spectral ranges, we are able to separate the effects of surface and bulk defects on the recombination dynamics of photo generated charge carriers. We further apply SPV measurements to obtain the minority carrier (electron) diffusion length for the MAPbBr3 crystal. This study demonstrates that both FIR reflectance and SPV measurements provide useful information on the electromagnetic response properties of halide perovskite single crystals.

It is known that zinc oxide (ZnO) is one of the promising electron transporting layers for solar cells and is also applicable for flexible devices. However, the utilization of ZnO in PSCs is restricted due to its reactivity with the perovskite film during the annealing process. Here, we demonstrate improved photovoltaic performance and stability by introducing monolayer graphene (MLG) at the interface of the ZnO ETL and perovskite absorber, which results in a stable electric to power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.81%. The device based on this modified ETL maintains more than 80% of its initial PCE value after 300h under continuous illumination. Interestingly, we find that the presence of MLG at the ETL/perovskite interface not only improves the carrier extraction and photovoltaic properties but also protects the perovskite film from decomposition at elevated temperatures, which is beneficial for the stability of the device. To improve the stability even further, we have passivated the surface of the perovskite film by using a new modulator, i.e., 3-(pentafluorophenyl)-propionamide (PFPA) to abate the surface trap states of the perovskite. Based on our modification with MLG and PFPA, a stable PSC device with a PCE of 21% was achieved under AM 1.5G illumination with negligible hysteresis. The stability result indicates that the passivated device on MLG/ZnO maintains 93% of its initial PCE value after 300 h under continuous illumination.

Bismuth Enhances the Stability of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPI) Perovskite under High Humidity	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; SINGLE-CRYSTALS; IODIDE PEROVSKITE; MOISTURE-TOLERANCE; DEGRADATION; EFFICIENCY; BANDGAP; WATER; CH(3)NH(3)PBL(3); FORMAMIDINIUM	Methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3, MAPI) is a high-performance solar cell material but lacks stability in the presence of humidity. Addition of a few percent bismuth (Bi) as a trivalent cation substitute for Pb (i.e., MAP(Bi)I) leads to enhanced stability under high (90%) relative humidity (RH). At moderate humidity (60% RH), however, MAP(Bi)I degrades more rapidly than MAPI. Bi incorporation into MAPI either stabilizes or destabilizes the two hydration products, MAPI center dot H2O and PbI2, depending on the amount of humidity in the environment.

However, transferring large-area graphene onto another material often involves dipping the material into water and other solvents. This process is incompatible with water-sensitive materials such as organometal halide perovskites. Here, a dry method is used and succeeded, for the first time, in stacking centimeter-sized graphene directly onto methylammonium lead iodide thin films without exposing the perovskite film to any liquid. Photoemission spectroscopy and nanosecond time-resolved photoelectrical measurement show that the graphene/perovskite interface does not contain significant amount of contaminants and sustain efficient interfacial electron transfer. The use of this method in fabricating graphene-on-perovskite photodetectors is further demonstrated. Besides a better photoresponsivity compared to detectors fabricated by the conventional perovskite-on-graphene structure, this dry transfer method provides a scalable pathway to incorporate graphene in multilayer devices based on water-sensitive materials.

However, the low-temperature solution-processed SnO2 usually results in high trap-state density and current-voltage hysteresis. Here, we reported an effective strategy to solve this problem by incorporating graphene ink into the low-temperature processed SnO2 for planar structure PSCs. The electron extraction efficiency has been significantly improved with graphene-doped SnO2 ETL coupled with attenuated charge recombination at the ETL/perovskite interface. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs based on the graphene-SnO2 ETL reached over 18% with negligible hysteresis. Incorporation of graphene into the ETL layer also enhanced the device stability retaining 90% of the initial PCE value after storing in ambient condition with a relative humidity of 40 +/- 5% for 300 h. Our results provide an important insight into further efficiency boost in SnO2-based low-temperature processed PSCs.

Solubilization of Carbon Nanotubes with Ethylene-Vinyl Acetate for Solution-Processed Conductive Films and Charge Extraction Layers in Perovskite Solar Cells	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						carbon nanotubes; conductive films; CNT polymer functionalization; insulating polymer; perovskite solar cells	SELECTIVE DISPERSION; TRANSITION ENERGIES; NONCOVALENT; DEPENDENCE	Carbon nanotube (CNT) solubilization via non-covalent wrapping of conjugated semiconducting polymers is a common technique used to produce stable dispersions for depositing CNTs from solution. Here, we report the use of a non-conjugated insulating polymer, ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), to disperse multi- and single-walled CNTs (MWCNT and SWCNT) in organic solvents. We demonstrate that despite the insulating nature of the EVA, we can produce semitransparent films with conductivities of up to 34 S/cm. We show, using photoluminescence spectroscopy, that the EVA strongly binds to individual CNTs, thus making them soluble, preventing aggregation, and facilitating the deposition of high-quality films. To prove the good electronic properties of this composite, we have fabricated perovskite solar cells using EVA/SWCNTs and EVA/MWCNTs as selective hole contact, obtaining power conversion efficiencies of up to 17.1%, demonstrating that the insulating polymer does not prevent the charge transfer from the active material to the CNTs.

Various nanoparticles have been reported to promote and induce mucus secretion, which could potentially lead to airway damages and respiratory complications. Lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM) is a nanoparticle widely used in solar oxidized fuel cells (SOFCs) due to its high electrical conductivity, high electrochemical activity for O-2 reduction reaction, high thermal stability and compatibility of SOFC electrolytes, and most importantly, its microstructural stability and long-term performance. Very few studies have been conducted on LMS's toxicity, thus its effect on airway cells was investigated in this study. After treating trachea cells with increasing concentrations of LSM ranging up to 500g/ml, we found that it has a moderate effect on cell viability, ROS production, cytochrome C, and caspase 3 expression. Despite its minimal impact on stated apoptosis-inducing characteristics, LSM illustrated an inhibiting effect on mucus secretion. We obtained a decreasing trend in mucus secretion with an increased concentration of the LSM treatment. Overall, LSM's advancement in SOFCs necessitated a toxicity study, and although it does not show a significant toxicity to trachea cells, LSM reduces mucus secretion, and can potentially interfere with airway clearance.

A Perovskite Solar Cell with Enhanced Light Stability and High Photovoltaic Conversion Efficiencies	ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING			English	Article						Perovskite solar cell; Bphen; Light stability; Schottky barrier	INTERFACIAL LAYER; CATHODE; IMPROVEMENT; HYSTERESIS; FULLERENE; VOLTAGE	Owing to the remarkable advantages of the perovskite solar cell (PSC), people regard the PSC as an auspicious candidate for photovoltaic devices in the near future, but light instability of the PSC, caused by TiO2 being a photo catalyst to decompose perovskite films under UV radiation, limits its practical applications. To improve light stability, removing the TiO2 layer from PSC devices is the best solution, but the photovoltaic conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the reported TiO2-layer-free PSCs are much lower than TiO2-layer-containing PSCs. As such, via applying a chemical engineering technique of inserting a layer of bathophenanthroline (Bphen) between the ITO substrate and the perovskite film, we developed a TiO2-layer-free PSC with both good light stability and an averaged PCE of around 18.53%, much higher than that of those reported ones. The insertion of the Bphen layer caused a dramatic promotion of shunt resistances (R-sh), causing the improvements of the open circuit voltages (V-oc), fill factors (FF), and PCE. Photoluminescence decay curves of perovskite films of various devices indicate that the Bphen layer leads to the enhancement of charge transport. It is the chief reason for the Bphen-layer-containing cells of structure 1 having a PCE as high as cells of structure 2 with blocking and mesoporous TiO2 layers. Stability tests show that the most significant role of the Bphen layer on the cell performance is the magnificent promotion of light stability. In sum, the Bphen layer plays a 3-fold role, i.e. blockage of hole transport, enhancement of the charge transport, and promotion of light stability, resulting in dramatically promoted device stability and PCEs.

However, the instability and intermittent energy output caused by the intensity fluctuation and/or the daily cycle of sunlight have motivated the direct application of PSCs in other energy fields. Here, we report an integrated solar-energy-conversion/water-splitting device comprising a single-junction PSC and CdS-decorated TiO2 nanorod array (i.e., semiconducting CdS/TiO2 NRA nanocomposite) photoanode with excellent photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance. Intriguingly, the introduction of PSC is found to effectively suppress the recombination of electrons and holes during the PEC catalytic process. As a result, the integrated device yields an overall solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 1.54% and exhibits a six-fold increase in the degradation rate of methylene blue over that of the CdS/TiO2 NRAs alone. As such, the crafting of a perovskite solar cell-assisted nanocomposite semiconductor photoanode may represent a viable route to alleviating the electron-hole recombination in water splitting and the degradation of organic pollutants, thus rendering the effective implementation of PSCs.

Recent studies of optical properties of halide perovskites suggest many novel opportunities for a design of advanced nanophotonic devices due to their low-cost fabrication, relatively high values of the refractive index, existence of excitons at room temperatures, broadband bandgap tunability, high optical gain, and strong nonlinear response, as well as simplicity of their integration with other types of optical and electronic structures. This paper provides an overview of the recent progress in the study of optical effects originating from nanostructured perovskites, and it also oversees a range of potential applications of resonant nanophotonics with halide perovskites.

To demonstrate effectiveness of PTO for electron-hole separation and charge transfer, perovskite solar cells are designed and fabricated in the laboratory with the PTO as the ESL. The cells achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of approximate to 12.28% upon preliminary optimization. It is found that the PTO ferroelectric layer can not only increase the PCE, but also tune the photocurrent via tuning PTO's ferroelectric polarization. Moreover, to understand the physical mechanism underlying the carrier transport by the ferroelectric polarization, the electronic structure of PTO/CH3NH3PbI3 heterostructure is computed using the first-principles methods, for which the triplet state is used to simulate charge transfer in the heterostructure. It is shown that the synergistic effect of type II band alignment and the specific ferroelectric polarization direction provide the effective extraction of electrons from the light absorber, while minimize recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Overall, the ferroelectric PTO is a promising and tunable ESL for optimizing electron transport in the perovskite solar cells. The design offers a different strategy for altering direction of carrier transport in solar cells.

The formation of such defects is suppressed by adding methylammonium chloride (MACl) as a crystallization aid to the precursor solution to realize high-quality, large-grain triple A-cation perovskite films and that are combined with judicious engineering of the perovskite interface with the electron and hole selective contact materials. A planar SnO2/TiO2 double layer oxide is introduced to ascertain fast electron extraction and the surface of the perovskite facing the hole conductor is treated with iodine dissolved in isopropanol to passivate surface trap states resulting in a retardation of radiationless carrier recombination. A maximum solar to electric power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.65% and open circuit photovoltage (V-oc) of approximate to 1.24 V with only approximate to 370 mV loss in potential with respect to the band gap are achieved, by applying these modifications. Additionally, the defect healing enhances the operational stability of the devices that retain 96%, 90%, and 85% of their initial PCE values after 500 h under continuously light illumination at 20, 50, and 65 degrees C, respectively, demonstrating one of the most stable planar PSCs reported so far.

Here, we report on a new type of 2D lead-free perovskite (C6H5C2H4NH3)(2)CsSn2I7 crystals with millimeter size and high field-effect hole mobility synthesized by a solution method. The excellent crystalline quality and phase purity have been verified by X-ray diffraction and low-temperature photoluminescence studies, while the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and energy-dispersive spectrometry measurements reveal the successful incorporation of Cs element into the resultant crystals and the absence of Sn4+ in the as-synthesized crystals. The as-synthesized crystals exhibit a high electrical conductivity and a high hole mobility up to 34 cm(2).V-1.s(-1) at 77 K. The crystals also show a high photoresponse resulting from the excellent optical properties and high electrical conductivity. Our findings show that the lead-free (C6H5C2H4NH3)(2)CsSn2I7 crystals with excellent optoelectronic properties would be a promising material for electronic and optoelectronic applications.

Highly stable and efficient all-inorganic lead-free perovskite solar cells with native-oxide passivation	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							TIN; LIGHT; FABRICATION; ATMOSPHERE	There has been an urgent need to eliminate toxic lead from the prevailing halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but the current lead-free PSCs are still plagued with the critical issues of low efficiency and poor stability. This is primarily due to their inadequate photovoltaic properties and chemical stability. Herein we demonstrate the use of the lead-free, all-inorganic cesium tin-germanium triiodide (CsSn(0.5)Ge(0.5)l(3)) solid-solution perovskite as the light absorber in PSCs, delivering promising efficiency of up to 7.11%. More importantly, these PSCs show very high stability, with less than 10% decay in efficiency after 500 h of continuous operation in N-2 atmosphere under one-sun illumination. The key to this striking performance of these PSCs is the formation of a full-coverage, stable native-oxide layer, which fully encapsulates and passivates the perovskite surfaces. The native-oxide passivation approach reported here represents an alternate avenue for boosting the efficiency and stability of lead-free PSCs.

Structural and thermodynamic limits of layer thickness in 2D halide perovskites	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						layered compounds; homologous series; Ruddlesden-Popper halide perovskites; formation enthalpy; photovoltaics	QUANTUM CONFINEMENT; IODIDE PEROVSKITES; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; LEAD; EXCITON; CRYSTAL; TIN; DIMENSIONALITY; EMISSION; CATIONS	In the fast-evolving field of halide perovskite semiconductors, the 2D perovskites (A')(2)(A)(n-1)MnX3n+1 [where A = Cs+, CH3NH3+, HC(NH2)(2)(+) ; A' = ammonium cation acting as spacer; M = Ge2+, Sn2+, Pb2+; and X = Cl-, Br-, I-] have recently made a critical entry. The n value defines the thickness of the 2D layers, which controls the optical and electronic properties. The 2D perovskites have demonstrated preliminary optoelectronic device lifetime superior to their 3D counterparts. They have also attracted fundamental interest as solution-processed quantum wells with structural and physical properties tunable via chemical composition, notably by the n value defining the perovskite layer thickness. The higher members (n > 5) have not been documented, and there are important scientific questions underlying fundamental limits for n. To develop and utilize these materials in technology, it is imperative to understand their thermodynamic stability, fundamental synthetic limitations, and the derived structure-function relationships. We report the effective synthesis of the highest iodide n-members yet, namely (CH3(CH2)(2)NH3)(2)(CH3NH3)(5)Pb6I19 (n = 6) and (CH3(CH2)(2)NH3)(2)(CH3NH3)(6)Pb7I22 (n = 7), and confirm the crystal structure with single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and provide indirect evidence for "(CH3(CH2)(2)NH3)(2)(CH3NH3)(8)Pb9I28" ("n = 9"). Direct HCl solution calorimetric measurements show the compounds with n > 7 have unfavorable enthalpies of formation (Delta H-f), suggesting the formation of higher homologs to be challenging. Finally, we report preliminary n-dependent solar cell efficiency in the range of 9-12.6% in these higher n-members, highlighting the strong promise of these materials for high-performance devices.

The procedure was developed by adjusting the lead halide to methylammonium/octylammonium halide precursor ratio. At a high precursor ratio (1:3), a blue-shifted photoinduced luminescence peak is measured at 642 nm for CH3NH3PbI3 with 0.01 to 12 mJ pulsed-laser irradiation. The appearance of this peak is reversible over 300 min upon blocking the irradiation. In order to determine if the peak is the result of a phase change, in situ x-ray diffraction measurements were performed. No phase change was measured with an irradiance that causes the appearance of the photoinduced luminescence peak. Luminescence microscpectroscopy measurements showed that the use of a lower precursor ratio (1:1.5) produces CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskites that are stable over 4 min of illumination. Given the lack of a measured phase change, and the dependence on the precursor ratio, the photoinduced luminesce peak may derive from surface trap states. The enhanced photostability of the resulting perovskite nanocrystals produced with the optimized synthetic procedure supports their use in stable optoelectronic devices.

J	Chcn, T; Zhou, YC; Rafailovich, M				Chcn, Thomas; Zhou, Yuchon; Rafailovich, Miriam			Application of Machine Learning in Perovskite Solar Cell Crystal Size Distribution Analysis	MRS ADVANCES			English	Article								This research automates edge detection for perovskite crystal grains using machine learning (ML). Once the edges of the crystal grains are located, a flood-fill algorithm can be used to find the distribution of crystal grain areas. The ML algorithm uses GNU Octave to run a regularized logistic regression algorithm that classifies each pixel of an input image as part of an edge or not part of an edge. The basic features used for the algorithm are each pixel's grayscale intensity, its Sobel derivative. Higher order Sobel derivatives, higher degree polynomial terms, and intensities convolved by various kernels were used as additional features to improve the program's accuracy and true-positive rate. Training data is obtained by using non-ML Canny Edge Detection to annotate the edges an SFAI image of a pure perovskite solar cell (PSC). The classifier exhibits an 85.58% accuracy and produces an edge mask that clearly outlines the crystals visually. The ML edge mask exhibits far fewer false-positive mis-classifications for pixels in the middle of the crystals than Canny. However, the ML mask's edges are fainter, owing to a lower true-positive classification rate. Using more kernels. higher order derivatives. and higher degree polynomial terms all significantly increased the true positive rate of the classifier, leading to thicker edges. This algorithm can greatly accelerate perovskite solar cell research (and potentially any research requiring particle size analysis), automating a process scientists previously had to perform by hand. This will facilitate the search for a solution for the world's growing demands for renewable energy.

Temperature dependent photoluminescence spectra show no evidence of a phase change demonstrating the stability of these systems. At low temperature, a barrier that impedes current flow and reduces the fill factor is apparent in the operation of the solar cell, particularly at 1 sun AM0. However, under low intensity and low temperature, where thermionic emission limits the carrier extraction, the fill factor and efficiency are recovered demonstrating the promise of these systems for deep space missions.

The ink synthesis is based on a simple wet chemical reaction and the inkjet printing protocol is a facile step by step method. The inkjet printed thin films have been characterized by X-ray diffraction, optical absorption spectroscopy, photoluminescent spectroscopy, and electronic transport measurements.

ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							MECHANISM	High band gap Pb bromide perovskite (APbBr(3))-based solar cells, where A is a mixture of formamidinium, methylammonium, and Cs, show significantly higher, relative, V-OC losses than their iodide analogs. Using photoluminescence-, quantum efficiency-, and surface photovoltage-spectroscopy measurements, we show the absence of any significant electronically active tail states within the bulk of the (FA(0.85)MA(0.1)Cs(0.05))PbBr3 absorber. All methods confirm that E-G = 2.28 eV for this halide perovskite, HaP. Contact potential difference measurements for this HaP, on different substrates, reveal a Z-shape dependence between the substrate work functions and that of the HaP, deposited on it, indicating that the HaP is relatively low doped and that its Fermi level is affected by the substrate onto which it is deposited. We confirm results from electron beam-induced current (EBIC) and other measurements that most voltage loss of cells, made with these HaP films, is at the HaP/selective-contact interface, specifically the TiO2/HaP one, and provide a complete account of these cells' V-OC losses. Capacitance measurements indicate that 350 mV V-OC could be gained by eliminating (fast) interfacial states, emphasizing the importance of interface passivation. Still, even passivating the TiO2/HaP interface cannot eliminate the band misalignment with Br-based HaPs.

We evaluate the different impacts that the 2D-confined spacer layer of butylammonium cations and the 3D-confined methylammonium cations have on the charge carrier dynamics in the two systems. Our results indicate that, while both the MA(+) and BA(+) cations play important roles in determining the carrier dynamics, the BA(+) cations exhibit stronger nonadiabatic couplings with the 2D perovskite framework. The consequence is a faster hot-carrier decay rate in 2D (BA)(2)(MA)Pb2I7 than in 3D MAPbI(3). Thus, tuning of the functional groups of the organic spacer cations in order to reduce the vibronic couplings between the cations and the Pb-I framework can offer the opportunity to slow down the hot-carrier relaxations and increase the carrier lifetimes in 2D lead-halide perovskites.

Reducing Surface Recombination Velocities at the Electrical Contacts Will Improve Perovskite Photovoltaics	ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; HIGH-EFFICIENCY; LUMINESCENCE; VOLTAGE; FILMS; LIMIT	We explore the effects of nonradiative recombination at the extracting contacts on the achievable performance of halide perovskite photovoltaic cells. First, we perform device simulations using standard drift-diffusion models with experimental semiconductor parameters matching those of methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI(3)). We quantify the range of surface recombination velocities (SRVs) that would allow this archetypal perovskite to reach power conversion efficiencies of 27%. In particular, for contacts with well-aligned energy levels, SRVs of similar to 1-10 cm/s should enable open-circuit voltages of 1.30 V, within 96% of the Shockley-Queisser limit. Next, we use time-resolved photoluminescence to experimentally determine the SRVs on 14 different common electron- and hole-extracting contacts, including TiO2, SnO2, ZnO, PCBM, ITIC, ICBA, TPBi, PEDOT:PSS, PTAA, PVK, NiO, MoO3, WO3, and spiro-OMeTAD. These results point the way to the selection and rational engineering of better contacts as a means to achieve higher efficiencies in perovskite solar cells.

Here, we demonstrate a lead-free two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden-Popper-type (C18H35NH3)(2)SnBr4 perovskite with a strong emission from the self-trapped states, whose photoluminescence quantum yields in colloidal suspension and in a film are 88 and 68%, respectively. The insulating character of the organic oleylamine cation prevents electronic band formation between the [SnBr6](4-) octahedron layers, which results in the Stokes-shifted orange emission. Electroluminescence of these 2D lead-free perovskite materials was demonstrated in an inverted LED structure with a low turn-on voltage of 2.2 V and a luminance of 350 cd/m(2).

Despite the evident structural differences with respect to standard perovskite solar cells (PSCs), similar impedance spectra were obtained for PQDSCs, pointing to similar working principles in terms of the active layer. We distinguish two different regimes: At low illumination, recombination is ruled by multiple trapping with trap distributions and/or shunting. However, at higher light intensities, Shockley-Read-Hall recombination is observed. In addition, the low-frequency capacitance, C-LF, of PQDSCs increases several orders of magnitude when the illumination is varied from dark to 1-sun conditions. This feature has not been observed in other kinds of photovoltaic devices and is characteristic of PSCs. Although there is no consensus about the exact mechanism responsible for C-LF, the suggested models point to an ion migration origin. Its observation in thin-film and PQDSCs devices implies a similar effect in both.

However, for solution-processed perovskite films, one of the major challenges for film quality improvement is the lack of a regulation strategy for the colloids in the precursor solution. Here, we demonstrate facet-dependent colloid engineering to adjust the quality of a perovskite film and its photovoltaic performance. This is realized by the development of a facet passivation strategy to synthesize PbI2 (S-PbI2) with tunable morphology. Further, facet-dependent PbI2 colloid regulation is demonstrated, and the relations among the morphology of the PbI2 crystal, features of PbI2 colloids, the morphology of the PbI2 film, and the photovoltaic performance of MAPbI(3) are established.

Cs2TeI6 consists of high atomic number elements, has high electrical resistance, and exhibits high air and moisture stability, making it suitable as a sensitive X-ray photoconductor. In addition, we identify that Cs2TeI6 film can be prepared under a low-temperature process using electrostatic-assisted spray technique under atmospheric conditions and achieved resistivity of 4.2 X 10(10) Omega.cm. The resulting air- and water-stable Cs2TeI6 device Controller exhibits a strong photoresponse to X-ray radiation. An electron drift length on the order of 200 mu m is estimated under an applied electrical field strength of 400 V.cm(-1). A high sensitivity for Cs2TeI6 thick film device is realized, with the value of 192 nC.R(-1)cm(-2) under 40 kVp X-rays at an electrical field of 250 V.cm(-1), which is similar to 20 times higher than that of the hybrid 3D perovskite polycrystalline film X-ray detectors. X-ray imaging based on Cs2TeI6 perovskite films will require lower radiation doses in many medical and security check applications.

While perovskite solar cells are expected to eventually compete with existing silicon-based solar cells on the market, their long-term stability has become a major bottleneck. In particular, perovskite films are found to be very sensitive to external factors such as air, UV light, light soaking, thermal stress and others. Among these stressors, light, oxygen and moisture-induced degradation can be slowed by integrating barrier or interface layers within the device architecture. However, the most representative perovskite absorber material, CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI(3)), appears to be thermally unstable even in an inert environment. This poses a substantial challenge for solar cell applications because device temperatures can be over 45 degrees C higher than ambient temperatures when operating under direct sunlight. Herein, recent advances in resolving thermal stability problems are highlighted through literature review. Moreover, the most recent and promising strategies for overcoming thermal degradation are also summarized.

Comparative evaluation of lead emissions and toxicity potential in the life cycle of lead halide perovskite photovoltaics	ENERGY			English	Article						Thin film solar cells; Lead halide perovskite; Photovoltaics; Life cycle assessment; Toxicity	SOLAR-CELLS; COAL; MODULES; ENERGY	Lead halide perovskites (LHP) are an emerging class of photovoltaic (PV) materials that have drawn intense interest due to their power conversion efficiencies above 23% and their potential for low-cost fabrication. However, the toxicity of lead causes concern about its use in LHP-PV at large scales. Here, we quantified lead intensity and toxicity potential of LHP-PV in potential commercial production. Lead intensity in LHP-PV life cycles can be 4 times lower and potential toxic emissions can be 20 times lower than those in representative U.S. electricity mixes, assuming that PV operational lifetimes reach 20 years. We introduce the metric "toxicity potential payback time", accounting for toxic emissions in the life cycle of energy cycles, and showed that it is < 2 years for perovskite PVs produced by and displacing the same grid mix. The toxicity potential associated with the energy of manufacturing a PV system dominates that associated with release of embodied lead. Therefore, the use of lead should not preclude commercialization of LHP-PVs. Instead, effort should focus on development of low-energy manufacturing processes and long service lifetimes. Additional detailed investigations are needed to quantify the full life cycle of commercial production of perovskites and to minimize potential emissions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This becomes even more obvious if unusual shapes appear in the impedance diagram. Here, a low frequency hook with positive imaginary part is discussed that often leaves researchers clueless of how to handle it, especially if there is no common model for the device under test that includes the hook, which is actually true for most electrochemical systems. The low frequency hook is explained from a systems theory perspective and a very basic explanation is given of what has to happen phenomenologically for this feature to appear. The most common equivalent circuit model (ECM) for such a low frequency hook is reviewed and the relation to a general empirical low-pass filter type model is discussed. A common electrochemical example and an abstract minimal example are introduced to facilitate the interpretation of the low frequency hook for an arbitrary (photo-) electrochemical system.

Here, we report the role of physisorption of oxygen species from the ambient atmosphere in the oxidation states and defective oxides at the surface of SnO2 nanoparticles for the performance of PSCs. The SnO2 nanoparticle's thin film shows a higher oxidation state (Sn-O) and lower charge trap sites at an annealing temperature of 100 degrees C, and the SnO(2 )film based PSCs yield an efficiency of 18.04%. The annealing process results in the gradual desorption of physically adsorbed oxygen species. Therefore, the annealing process of SnO2 nanoparticle thin films in atmosphere is the key factor to control the oxidation states and defective oxides at the surface of SnO2 nanoparticle thin films.

In this paper, we demonstrate that the CH3NH3PbI3 film with larger grain sizes and fewer grain boundaries exhibits a higher thermal stability and the solar cell device exhibits improved photovoltaic performance. The grain size is well controlled by employing isopropanol solvent annealing on CH3NH3PbI3 films, and the highest efficiency of perovskite solar cells increases from 16.87% to 18.56% with the increase in the grain size. The results demonstrate that the reduction of grain boundaries is a feasible strategy to solve the thermal instability issue of perovskite thin films.

With only several years of development, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has increased from 3.8% to 22.7%. In general, PSCs have two types of structural architecture: mesoporous and planar. The latter possesses higher potential for commercialization due to its simpler structure and fabrication process, especially the inverted planar structure, which possesses negligible hysteresis. In an inverted PSC, the electron transport materials (ETM) are deposited on a perovskite film. Only a few ETMs can be used for inverted PSCs as the perovskite film is easily damaged by the solvent used to dissolve the ETM. Furthermore, the energy levels of the ETM should be well aligned with that of the perovskites. Normally it is difficult to use inorganic ETMs as they require high temperatures for the annealing process to improve the electron conductivity; the perovskite film cannot sustain these high temperatures. To date, the fullerene derivative, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), is the most commonly used organic ETM for high efficiency inverted planar PSCs. However, the high manufacturing cost due to its complex synthesis retards the industrialization of the PSCs. Here, we introduce a fullerene pyrrolidine derivative, N-methyl-2-pentyl-[60]fullerene pyrrolidine (NMPFP), synthesized via the Prato reaction of C-60 directly with cheap hexanal and sarcosine. Then the NMPFP electron transport layer (ETL) was prepared by a simple solution process. The properties of the resulting NMPFP ETLs were characterized using UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry measurements, atomic force microscopy, and conductivity test. From the results of the UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry measurements, the LUMO level of NMPFP ETL was calculated to be 0.2 eV higher than that of the PCBM ETL. This contributes to a higher open-circuit photovoltage. In addition, the NMPFP film presented higher conductivity than the PCBM film. Thus, the photo-generated charge carriers in the perovskite films should be transported more efficiently to the NMPFP electron transport layer (ETL) than to the PCBM ETL. This was confirmed by the results of the steady-state photoluminescence spectroscopy. Finally, the NMPFP as an alternative low-cost ETL was employed in an inverted planar PSC to evaluate the device performance. The device made with the NMPFP ETL yielded an efficiency of 13.83% with negligible hysteresis, which is comparable to the PCBM counterpart devices. Moreover, since stability is another important parameter retarding the commercialization of PSCs, the stability of the PCBM and NMPFP base PSCs were investigated and compared. It was found that the NMPFP devices possessed significantly improved stability due to the higher hydrophobicity of the NMPFP. In conclusion, this research demonstrates that NMPFP is a promising ETL to replace PCBM for the industrialization of cheap, efficient and stable inverted planar PSCs.

Recently emerged perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) offer more advantages including improved size-tunable band gap, structural stability, and solvent-based processing. Here we report a simple surfactant-assisted two-step synthesis to produce monodisperse PbI2 NCs which are then converted to methylammonium lead iodide perovskite NCs. Based on electron microscopy characterization, these NCs showed competitive monodispersity. Combined results from X-ray diffraction patterns, optical absorption, and photoluminescence confirmed the formation of high quality methylammonium lead iodide perovskite NCs. More importantly, by avoiding the use of hard-to-remove chemicals, the resulted perovskite NCs can be readily integrated in applications, especially solar cells through versatile solution/colloidal-based methods.

Yet, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of polycrystalline (3D) CsPbBr3 based PeLEDs needs further improvement. The low efficiency was attributed to severe luminescence quenching at PEDOT:PSS (Poly-(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate))/ CsPbBr3 interface arising from (i) interfacial energy barrier between PEDOT:PSS and CsPbBr3 layer, (ii) poor crystallization and large pinholes in perovskite film, and (iii) indium fin oxide (ITO) anode etching due to PEDOT:PSS acidity. Therefore, it is necessary to address all these problems simultaneously to reduce the luminescence quenching and to improve device efficiency. Here, we introduce a feasible approach to modify the PEDOT:PSS layer in order to reduce the luminescence quenching at PEDOT:PSS/CsPbBr3 interface. In this modification, PEDOT:PSS is mixed with a MoO3 ammonia solution at desired volume ratios. Our studies demonstrate that upon this treatment, not only hole injection and crystallization of perovskite film are improved but also ITO is protected from etching by the acidic nature of PEDOT:PSS. This modification result in a high performance all inorganic CsPbBr3 LED with a maximum luminance of similar to 34420 cd/m(2) and a current efficiency of similar to 7.30 cd/A. In addition, our state-of-the-art perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) exhibit no degradation after 2 h of continuous operation, representing a stable PeLEDs based on one-step solution processed polycrystalline CsPbBr3.

All of the phthalocyanine complexes show excellent thermal stabilities, appropriate energy levels and suitable hole mobilities. The potential of three HTMs were tested in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and ZnPcNO2-OBFPh based PSC obtained power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.74% under 100 mA cm(-2) standard AM 1.5G solar illumination. Most important of all, PSC based on ZnPcNO2-OBFPh shows better stability than that of the other two phthalocyanines and Spiro-OMeTAD under continuous light irradiation at 60 degrees C and maximum power point tracking in ambient air without encapsulation after 500 h. The results show that the introduction of appropriate peripheral groups and core metals can improve the performance and stability of PSCs dramatically, which provides an alternative way to develop HTMs for efficient and stable PSCs.

Understanding Detrimental and Beneficial Grain Boundary Effects in Halide Perovskites	ADVANCED MATERIALS			English	Article						amorphous grain boundaries; carrier lifetime; diffusion length; electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD); grain size effect; halide perovskites; mobility	METHYLAMMONIUM LEAD IODIDE; SOLAR-CELLS; POLYCRYSTALLINE SILICON; MULTICRYSTALLINE SILICON; DIFFUSION LENGTHS; RECOMBINATION; FILMS; PHOTOLUMINESCENCE; PERFORMANCE; ENERGY	Grain boundaries play a key role in the performance of thin-film optoelectronic devices and yet their effect in halide perovskite materials is still not understood. The biggest factor limiting progress is the inability to identify grain boundaries. Noncrystallographic techniques can misidentify grain boundaries, leading to conflicting literature reports about their influence; however, the gold standard - electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) - destroys halide perovskite thin films. Here, this problem is solved by using a solid-state EBSD detector with 6000 times higher sensitivity than the traditional phosphor screen and camera. Correlating true grain size with photoluminescence lifetime, carrier diffusion length, and mobility shows that grain boundaries are not benign but have a recombination velocity of 1670 cm s(-1), comparable to that of crystalline silicon. Amorphous grain boundaries are also observed that give rise to locally brighter photoluminescence intensity and longer lifetimes. This anomalous grain boundary character offers a possible explanation for the mysteriously long lifetime and record efficiency achieved in small grain halide perovskite thin films. It also suggests a new approach for passivating grain boundaries, independent of surface passivation, to lead to even better performance in optoelectronic devices.	[Adhyaksa, Gede W.

Here, it is shown that the 3-(decyldimethylammonio)-propane-sulfonate inner salt (DPSI), which is a sulfonic zwitterion, plays dual roles in tuning the crystallization behavior and passivating the defects of perovskites. The synergistic effect of crystallization control and defect passivation remarkably suppresses pinhole formation, reduces the charge trap density, and lengthens the carrier recombination lifetime, and thereafter boosts the small-area (0.08 cm(2)) planar perovskite device efficiency to 21.1% and enables a high efficiency of 18.3% for blade-coating large-area (1 cm(2)) devices. The device also shows good light stability, which remains at 88% of the initial efficiency under continuous unfiltered AM 1.5G light illumination for 480 h. These findings provide an avenue for simultaneous crystallization control and defect passivation to further improve the performance of perovskite devices.

In this work, in situ alternating current impedance spectroscopy measurements on CH(NH2)(2)PbBr3 (FAPbBr(3)) have been carried out under high pressure up to 4.8 GPa. The inductive loop has been discovered at low frequencies and can be tuned dramatically by applying pressure, which is attributed to large FA ion migration in FAPbB(r)3. Two discontinuous changes are observed in both ionic and electronic resistances around phase transition pressure. The pressure dependent photoresponse of FAPbBr(3) has also been studied by in situ photocurrent measurements under high pressure up to 3.8 GPa. It indicates that the photocurrent of FAPbBr(3) can be enhanced remarkably at 1.3 GPa and the largest photocurrent value in FAPbBr(3) is nearly 10 times larger than that in CH3NH3PbBr3 and about 3 times larger than that in CH3NH3PbI3.

Here, we report structural, electronic, excitonic, and optical properties of lead-free 2D Ruddlesden-Popper hybrid perovskites (CH3(CH2)(3)NH3)(2)(CH3NH3)(n-1)GenI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, and 3) from first-principles calculations. Our results show that the 2D perovskites have a higher stability than their 3D analogous (CH3NH3)GeI3 (n = ), and their band gaps decrease with increasing n values, from 1.88 eV (n = 1), to 1.83 eV (n = 2), to 1.69 eV (n = 3), and to 1.57 eV (n = ). The 2D perovskites exhibit a strong anisotropic feature, i.e., a low charge carrier effective mass and strong absorption in their 2D planes as compared to that in their third direction. These 2D perovskites also show a high exciton binding energy, allowing for an enhanced photoluminescence quantum efficiency with respect to their 3D compounds. These results suggest a great potential of these germanium-based 2D hybrid perovskites in the optoelectronic applications.

To improve the efficiency of these steps, several combinations of materials have been examined. Due to their excellent optical properties, two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides (2D-TMDs) have recently been explored. Another promising class of materials to platform efficient PVs is organic-inorganic perovskites. Here, we report on the ultrafast exciton dissociation through electron transfer from a 2D tungsten disulfide (WS2) monolayer to a thin layer of methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) perovskites. Photoluminescence measurements showed that when the 2D-WS2 monolayer was covered with perovskites, its emission completely quenched, suggesting that the CT process is highly efficient. Despite that pump-probe spectroscopy measurements were carried out with a similar to 45 fs temporal resolution, the CT dynamics were not captured. A comparison of the ultrafast dynamics of the two band-edge excitons of the charge donor (2D-WS2) suggested that electron transfer is the dominant pathway of CT. Furthermore, these pump-probe measurements indicated that a small fraction of transferred electrons remained in the perovskites up to almost 2 ns. These findings may open a new horizon for understanding the dissociation of photogenerated excitons in 2D-TMDs through hybridization with another class of nanomaterials.

Herein, we grow a 2D-quasi-2D-3D Sn perovskite film using removable pseudohalogen NH4SCN as a structure regulator. This hierarchy structure remarkably enhances air stability resulting from the parallel growth of 2D PEA(2)SnI(4) as the surface layer. We then explore the hierarchy structure perovskite films in planar structural solar cells, which generate a PCE up to 9.41%. The device retains 90% of its initial performance for almost 600 hr. Our results suggest that adding removable NH4SCN in a perovskite precursor can significantly improve the stability and photovoltaic performance of Sn perovskite. This finding provides a powerful strategy to manipulate the structure of low-dimensional perovskite in order to enhance the performance of perovskite solar cells.

In addition to efficiency optimization, understanding the fundamental properties of the perovskite materials and the related device physics, such as hysteresis and stability, has also attracted significant research interest. In this study, we manifested the fact that the hysteretic behavior of PVSC is strongly correlated with the structure design of the adjacent charge-transporting layer (CTL). The constituent ions in CTL are very likely to induce severe device hysteresis based on the analyses from the capacitance-voltage and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. By further applying Warburg impedance to simulate the impedance spectrum at the low-frequency region, distinct kinetics of ion movement at different perovskite/electron-transporting layer interfaces are clearly revealed. This work unveils the close interactions between the perovskite material and the ions from adjacent CTLs, providing a new perspective on the future molecular design of CTLs for PVSCs.

Near infrared to ultraviolet complex dielectric function (epsilon = epsilon(1) + i epsilon(2)) spectra of varying cesium-to-formamidinium ratios in solution processed perovskite thin films have been extracted. Analysis of these epsilon spectra track changes in the positions of critical point (CP) energies, including band gaps and above band gap transitions, with increasing cesium contents. Band gap values are identified as the lowest energy CP, with additional sub-gap features attributed to the presence of defects. Absorption onset values, for which absorption coefficient (alpha) = 4000 cm(-1), are extracted, with x = 0.2 showing the sharpest absorption edge and the least contribution to absorption from defects below the band gap. External quantum efficiency (EQE) simulations of solar cells using epsilon spectra as input are compared to experimental results and corroborate that the observed sub-gap absorption is due to defects as it does not contribute to EQE.

One tetraphenylbenzidine (TPB) based HTM, XY1, was designed and synthesized. XY1 exhibits suitable thermal stability, film-forming property, and hole mobility. Notably, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.23 % under 100 mW cm(-2) AM 1.5G illumination is obtained from cells by using XY1 as HTM. Moreover, the unsealed device based on XY1 maintains its initial PCE for 600 h when aged under ambient air of 40% relative humidity in the dark and dropped by 30.2% after 480 h under continuous operation at 1-sun illumination in ambient air, respectively, which is much better than devices based on Spiro-OMeTAD. The results demonstrate a simple molecular engineering strategy to design TPB based hole-transporting materials for highly stable perovskite solar cells, which is important for commercial application.

Dynamic Disorder Dominates Delocalization, Transport, and Recombination in Halide Perovskites	CHEM			English	Article							CHARGE-CARRIER MOBILITIES; SELF-TRAPPED EXCITONS; HYBRID PEROVSKITES; ADDUCT APPROACH; SOLAR-CELLS; BASE ADDUCT; EFFICIENCY; DIFFUSION; POLARONS; FILMS	We investigate the origins of exceptionally long charge-carrier lifetimes of halide perovskites by using temperature-dependent and time-resolved mid-infrared spectroscopy. We report direct observations of large polarons through their distinct mid-infrared electronic transitions and quantitatively correlate their formation with enhancement of electron-phonon coupling that quenches photoluminescence. The temperature-dependent study reveals a branching between free-carrier and large-polaron states in association with thermally induced dynamic disorder of the anharmonic inorganic framework, which is examined through local vibrational modes of the perovskite films. This dynamic disorder localizes charge carriers and enhances electron-phonon coupling, which both quenches photoluminescence and promotes large-polaron formation. Fortunately, such localization extends the charge recombination lifetime by nearly an order of magnitude. This work highlights the interplay between charge-carrier mobility and lifetime and suggests design rules about how cation and anion substitution can be used to tune the structural dynamics that underpin their relationship.

Here, we introduce a low-cost and stable conjugated donor polymer (PTQ10) as interfacial layer in the planar n-i-p structured pero-SCs. The polymer was applied to the perovskite intermediate phase before the thermal annealing. This treatment significantly reduced the loss of surface organic cation during thermal annealing. Importantly, the kinetics of phase conversion of perovskite was influenced, and perovskite crystal showed a more preferential orientation. Moreover, the polymer proved to be an effective hole extraction layer due to the proper energy alignment with perovskite. Finally, a champion power conversion efficiency of the planar pero-SCs was achieved at 21.2% with a high fill factor of 81.6%. The devices also showed great ambient and thermal stability. This work presents a facile way of perovskite surface control to achieve high-performance pero-SCs.

Thiazole-Induced Surface Passivation and Recrystallization of CH3NH3PbI3 Films for Perovskite Solar Cells with Ultrahigh Fill Factors	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						film quality; spin coating crystal growth; defect density; vapor annealing	HALIDE PEROVSKITES; CRYSTAL-GROWTH; BASE ADDUCT; EFFICIENCY; PERFORMANCE; ELECTRON; MORPHOLOGY; CRYSTALLIZATION; HYSTERESIS; EVOLUTION	The quality of perovskite films is a crucial factor governing the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells. However, perovskite films fabricated by the conventional one-step spin-coating procedure are far from ideal due to uncontrollable crystal growth. Herein, we report a facile recrystallization procedure using a thiazole additive coupled with vapor annealing to simultaneously modulate the perovskite crystal growth and suppress the surface defects. High quality perovskite films with no pin holes, high crystallinity, large grain size, and low roughness were obtained. Moreover, using the space charge limited current method, we observe that the defect density of the as-prepared perovskite films with the thiazole additive was decreased by 40% when compared with the film without thiazole. The lower defect density of these perovskite films enables the achievement of a final power conversion efficiency of 18% and an exceptionally high fill factor of 0.82, which correspond to a 25% enhancement compared with the control device. Our results reveal a novel and facile path to modulate the perovskite crystal growth and simultaneously suppress the film defect density and increasing efficiency in perovskite photovoltaics and related optoelectronic applications.

Recently, there have been debates on the microstructure-related defects in metal halide perovskites (grain size, grain boundaries, etc.) and a widespread view is that large grains are a prerequisite to suppress nonradiative recombination and improve photovoltaic performance, although opinions against it also exist. Herein, we employ blends of methylammonium lead iodide perovskites with an insulating polymer (polyvinylpyrrolidone) that offer the possibility to tune the grain size in order to obtain a fundamental understanding of the photoresponse at the microscopic level. We provide, for the first time, spatially resolved details of the microstructures in such blend systems via Raman mapping, light beam-induced current imaging, and conductive atomic force microscopy. Although the polymer blend systems systematically alter the morphology by creating small grains (more grain boundaries), they reduce nonradiative recombination within the film and enhance its spatial homogeneity of radiative recombination. We attribute this to a reduction in the density of bulk trap states, as evidenced by an order of magnitude higher photoluminescence intensity and a significantly higher open-circuit voltage when the polymer is incorporated into the perovskite films. The solar cells employing blend systems also show nearly hysteresis-free power conversion efficiency similar to 17.5%, as well as a remarkable shelf-life stability over 100 days.

X-ray photoemission spectroscopy measurements show that within 10 h of illumination, about half of the initial C, N, and Br elemental concentrations leave the surface and about half of the perovskite's Pb is converted into metallic Pb. Light exposures while in the UHV system also significantly roughen the surface, and surprisingly, empty voids form approximate to 1 to 3 mu m down in the light exposed region. A framework based on the Kirkendall effect is put forward to explain the observed void formation. This proposed model may be relevant to the slow degradation of perovskite solar cells, which is sometimes attributed to irreversible chemical reactions from undesired diffusion. These measurements and observations reveal the intrinsic behavior of the CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystals under light illumination while in a UHV system where volatile species are free to leave, in contrast to existing device studies on the photostability of perovskite solar cells.

Laser Annealing of TiO2 Electron-Transporting Layer in Perovskite Solar Cells	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						perovskites; solar cells; TiO2; laser processing; flexible; electron-transporting layer	BLOCKING LAYER; TRANSFORMATION; STATE	Solution-processed TiO2 and other metal-oxide electron-transporting layers (ETLs) for perovskite solar cells commonly require high-temperature annealing (>450 degrees C), causing the underlying indium-tin oxide (ITO) to degrade and inhibiting the use of flexible plastic substrates, such as poly(ethylene naphthalate). Laser-based solar cell manufacturing is attracting increased interest and can enable rapid and low-temperature fabrication of perovskite solar cells. By using novel pulsed ultraviolet laser processing on the solution-processed TiO2, we demonstrate a champion 17.1% efficient flexible perovskite solar cell. We can independently control the annealing of the ETL without affecting the underlying ITO or substrate due to the shallow absorption depth and short pulse duration of the laser. Ellipsometry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy verify that the laser annealed TiO2 thin film is stoichiometric and relatively denser than the thermally annealed control sample. The efficiencies of the laser-processed devices exceeded those fabricated via hot plate, but with the added benefit of a high-throughput, low temperature, and flexible-substrate-friendly process.

However, the stability and performance reproducibility of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) needs to be further improved to match that of silicon photovoltaic devices before they can be commercialized. One of the major bottlenecks that hinders the improvement of device stability/reproducibility is the additives in the hole-transport layer, lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP). Despite the positive effects of these hole-transport layer additives, LiTFSI is hygroscopic and can adsorb moisture to accelerate the perovskite decomposition. On the other hand, tBP, the only liquid component in PSCs, which evaporates easily, is corrosive to perovskite materials. Since 2012, the empirical molar ratio 6:1 tBP:LiTFSI has been wildly applied in PSCs without further concerns. In this study, the formation of tBP-LiTFSI complexes at various molar ratios has been discovered and investigated thoroughly. These complexes in PSCs can alleviate the negative effects (decomposition and corrosion) of individual components tBP and LiTFSI while maintaining their positive effects on perovskite materials. Consequently, a minor change in tBP:LiTFSI ratio results in huge influences on the stability of perovskite. Due to the existence of uncomplexed tBP in the 6:1 tBP:LiTFSI mixture, this empirical tBP-LiTFSI molar ratio has been demonstrated not as the ideal ratio in PSCs. Instead, the 4:1 tBP:LiTFSI mixture, in which all components are complexed, shows all positive effects of the hole-transport layer components with dramatically reduced negative effects. It minimizes the hygroscopicity of LiTFSI, while lowering the evaporation speed and corrosive effect of tBP. As a result, the PSCs fabricated with this tBP:LiTFSI ratio have the highest average device efficiency and obviously decreased efficiency variation with enhanced device stability, which is proposed as the golden ratio in PSCs. Our understanding of interactions between hole-transport layer additives and perovskite on a molecular level shows the pathway to further improve the PSCs' stability and performance reproducibility to make them a step closer to large-scale manufacturing.

In this contribution, we investigate the influence of precursor concentration on the film thickness, grain size, and orientation of these polycrystalline thin-films. We vary the molar concentration of the perovskite precursor containing Rb, Cs, MA, FA, Pb, I, and Br from 0.4 to 1.2 M. We use optical and electrical probes to measure local properties and correlate the effect of crystallographic orientation on the inter- and intragrain charge-carrier transport. We find that, with increasing precursor concentration, the grain size of the polycrystalline thin-films becomes larger and more faceted. Films with small grains show mostly random grain orientation angles, whereas films with large grains are oriented with {100} planes around an angle of 20 degrees relative to the surface normal. These films with oriented large grains also show longer lived charge-carrier lifetimes and an improved charge-carrier extraction at the surface. Our results provide new insights into the role of process conditions (precursor concentration) on film morphology (grain size and orientation), and consequently on the homogeneity of local performance, which could bring perovskite solar cells beyond the state-of-the-art.

Vapor Deposition of Transparent, p-Type Cuprous Iodide Via a Two-Step Conversion Process	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						chemical vapor deposition (CVD); copper(I) iodide (CuI); solar cells; p-type semiconductor; copper(I) sulfide (Cu2S); transparent conductor	PEROVSKITE SOLAR-CELLS; ATOMIC LAYER DEPOSITION; HOLE TRANSPORT LAYER; COPPER IODIDE; THIN-FILMS; ROOM-TEMPERATURE; SURFACE; CONDUCTOR; EFFICIENT; STABILITY	Photovoltaic devices require p-type layers with high optical transparency and electrical conductivity. One promising material is cuprous iodide, CuI, thin films of which have hole mobilities in the 1-12 cm(2)/V.s range. However, despite adequate electrical properties in many CuI thin films, most deposition processes afford only rough films that have poor continuity and low optical transparency, hampering the final device performance. We now report an all-vapor method, amenable to large-scale processing, for preparation of CuI thin films with near record optical and electrical properties. In this process, thin films of Cu(2-x)S (x = 0-0.1) or Cu2O grown by chemical vapor deposition from bis(N,N'-di-sec-butylacetamidinato)dicopper(I) in combination with hydrogen sulfide or water, respectively, were converted to gamma-CuI upon exposure to dilute hydrogen iodide vapor. The rate of this iodide-for-chalcogenide anion exchange reaction is controlled by the concentration and delivery rate of HI. The nucleation rate of the nascent CuI may be modified by dosing with iodine vapor (for Cu(2-x)S) or with vapors of thiodiglycol or ethylene glycol (for Cu2O). By balancing the rates of nucleation and conversion, we are able to prepare smooth, continuous thin films possessing optical and electrical properties approaching those of the best native p-type CuI films. We believe that the underlying chemical and materials science reasoning leading to these high-quality films will prove instructive in other thin-film systems. Furthermore, based on the measured band positions and carrier mobilities we anticipate high utility for these smooth CuI films as hole-transport layers in Earth-abundant, inexpensive thin-film photovoltaics.

In this work, a typical organic molecule bathocuproine (BCP) has been utilized during the preparation of a methylammonium lead tribromide (CH3NH3PbBr3) precursor, and a perovskite-based light-emitting diode (PeLED) consisting of ITO(glass)/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbBr3:BCP/Bphen/Ag was fabricated. Because of the participation of BCP, PeLED exhibits excellent light-emissive properties without any crystalline distortions of CH3NH3PbBr3, such as low turn-on voltage Vturn-on = 2.5 V, high luminescent intensity L = 1.4 x 10(4) cd/m(2), and high efficiency eta = 3.2 cd/A. On the basis of electronic transport and optically spectroscopic characterizations, it has been verified that such remarkable and desirable enhancements are attributed to three contributions: (i) a decrease of CH3NH3PbBr3 crystalline grain size, (ii) a reduction of trap density (n(t)), and (iii) an improvement of electronic charge mobility (mu(e)). We thus believe that not only may this work pave the way for the present fast development of PeLEDs, but it also provides some insightful physics studies for device physicists.

Well-controlled and understood charge carrier transport through the device stack is required to make the next step in efficiency improvements. In this paper, polymer-wrapped single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) films embedded in an insulating poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix and capped by a thermally evaporated Au electrode are investigated as a composite hole transport layer and optical spacer. Employing transient absorption spectroscopy we show that the SWNTs enhance the charge transfer rate from CQD to CQD, ZnO, or SWNT. In order to pinpoint the underlying mechanism for the improvement, we investigate the energetics of the junction by measuring the relative alignment of the band edges, using Kelvin probe and cyclic voltammetry. Measuring the external quantum efficiency and absorption we find that the improvement is not mainly from electronic improvements but from enhanced absorption of the CQD absorber. We demonstrate experimentally and theoretically, by employing a transfer-matrix model, that the transparent PMMA matrix acts as an optical spacer, which leads to an enhanced absorption in the absorber layer. With these electronic and optical enhancements, the efficiency of the PbS CQD solar cells improved from 4.0% to 6.0%.	[Tazawa, Yujiro; Zhang, Nanlin; Gregory, Daniel A.

In situ recombination junction between p-Si and TiO2 enables high-efficiency monolithic perovskite/Si tandem cells	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; PHOTOANODES; CONTACTS; PASSIVATION; BEHAVIOR; LAYERS; GAAS	Increasing the power conversion efficiency of silicon (Si) photovoltaics is a key enabler for continued reductions in the cost of solar electricity. Here, we describe a two-terminal perovskite/Si tandem design that increases the Si cell's output in the simplest possible manner: by placing a perovskite cell directly on top of the Si bottom cell. The advantageous omission of a conventional interlayer eliminates both optical losses and processing steps and is enabled by the low contact resistivity attainable between n-type TiO2 and Si, established here using atomic layer deposition. We fabricated proof-of-concept perovskite/Si tandems on both homojunction and passivating contact heterojunction Si cells to demonstrate the broad applicability of the interlayer-free concept. Stabilized efficiencies of 22.9 and 24.1% were obtained for the homojunction and passivating contact heterojunction tandems, respectively, which could be readily improved by reducing optical losses elsewhere in the device. This work highlights the potential of emerging perovskite photovoltaics to enable low-cost, high-efficiency tandem devices through straightforward integration with commercially relevant Si solar cells.

Thick TiO2-Based Top Electron Transport Layer on Perovskite for Highly Efficient and Stable Solar Cells	ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							DEGRADATION; STABILITY; STATES; TIO2	Simultaneously achieving high efficiency, long-term stability, and robust fabrication with good reproducibility in perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) is essential for their practical applications. Herein, we first demonstrate a thick TiO2 backbone film directly on top of a perovskite film through a simple room-temperature solution process. Through the strategy of decorating the TiO2 film with fullerene for passivating traps and filling voids, we achieve a fullerene-decorated TiO2 electron transport layer (ETL) in inverted PVSCs. Because of the suppressed monomolecular Shockley-Read-Hall recombination and ion diffusion of the fullerene-decorated TiO2 ETL, stabilized efficiencies of similar to 20% and shelf life stability remaining over 98% of initial efficiency after aging in ambient conditions or 16 months are achieved. Remarkably, the PVSCs are insensitive to TiO2 thickness from 50 to 250 nm, which contributes significantly to the robust fabrication and high reproducibility of the PVSCs. This work provides an ETL design on top of a perovskite film for simultaneous improvement of PVSC efficiency, stability, and reproducibility.

Improving Charge Carrier Delocalization in Perovskite Quantum Dots by Surface Passivation with Conductive Aromatic Ligands	ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							LEAD IODIDE PEROVSKITE; SOLAR-CELLS; HIGH-EFFICIENCY; HIGHLY LUMINESCENT; IMPROVED STABILITY; ORGANIC COMPLEXES; CAPPING LIGANDS; THIN-FILMS; NANOCRYSTALS; PHOTOLUMINESCENCE	Long-chain saturated hydrocarbons and alkoxysilanes are ligands that are commonly used to passivate perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) to enhance their stability and optical properties. However, the insulating nature of these capping ligands creates an electronic energy barrier and impedes interparticle electronic coupling, thereby limiting device applications. One strategy to solve this problem is the use of short conductive aromatic ligands that allow delocalization of the electronic wave function from the PQDs, which, in turn, facilitates charge transport between PQDs by lowering the energy barrier. This is demonstrated with methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr(3)) QDs prepared using benzylamine (BZA) and benzoic acid (BA) capping ligands. Optimized BZA-BA-MAPbBr(3) QDs are highly stable and show very high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY) (86%). More importantly, the BZA-BA-MAPbBr(3) QD film exhibits higher conductivity and carrier lifetime and more efficient charge extraction compared to PQDs with insulating ligands, as indicated by electrochemical measurements and transient photocurrent and photovoltage spectroscopy.

Here, for the first time a classic hole transport material, poly (3, 4-ethylene dioxy-thiophene)-poly (styrene sulfonate) (abbreviated as PEDOT:PSS) was introduced as additive directly into the CH3NH3PbI3 - xClx perovskite absorber. On controlled fine-tuning of PEDOT:PSS concentration within perovskite resulted into the high-quality films with large crystal grains that ultimately resulted into improved optoelectronic and charge transport properties. Due to the complexation between the PEDOT:PSS and CH3NH3PbI3 - xClx the defects in the active layer of perovskite as well as the passivation of back-and-front contact recombination occurred that leads to possible trap state healing in bulk as well at interfaces and this resulted into a longer lifetime charge carrier compare to the perovskite film without PEDOT:PSS additives. Solar cells prepared using 1.5 v% PEDOT:PSS and perovskite resulted an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.56%. This finding provided a simple way to fabricate efficient planar perovskite solar cells for the commercial applications.

The pristine champion devices fabricated by our optimized techniques can achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of similar to 18% with a negligible hysteresis. Accelerated by exposure to concentrated sunlight of 200 mW/cm(2), the short-term degradation tests show that the degradation effects of light exposure on the lattice and electronic structures of the MAPbI(3) active layer are almost negligible and the photoelectric parameters of devices demonstrate superior photochemical stability against illumination, which can be ascribed to the introductions of the Cu electrode and the proper charge transport layers of PTAA and Bphen. As the MAPbI(3) layers are integrated in devices and wrapped in these coverlayers, the volatile decomposition products originated from the photochemical reactions in MAPbI(3) active layer should be restrained inside of the active layer and finally regenerated MAPbI(3). Moreover, the Cu electrode strongly retards the photochemical reactions by restraining the diffusion of I- ions and further enhances photochemical stability of the devices.

We use density functional theory (DFT) calculations with the generalized gradient functional PBEsol, the meta-GGA functional SCAN, and the hybrid functional HSE06, including spin-orbit coupling, to screen substituent elements based on their fundamental bandgap. Of the 27 candidate elements explored, we identify six (Mg, Si, Ge, Cd, Hg, and Zn) to be viable candidates for replacing Pb in the hybrid perovskites. We further characterize the optical absorption spectrum, with and without spin-orbit coupling, for these candidate replacements.

However, their power conversion efficiency (PCE) is much lower than that of their 3D counterparts owing to large exciton binding energy, poor carrier transport, and low conductivity. Herein, we developed a methylammonium (MA) based 2D perovskite thin film using vapor-fumigation technology. Compared to the traditional 2D perovskite based on bulky butylammonium (BA) cations, its exciton binding energy significantly decreased to 172 meV from 510 meV, as calculated by first-order perturbation theory and an infinite barrier approximation, due to the high dielectric constant of MA. According to the WKb approximation, the tunneling probability of a carrier through a quantum well increased by four orders of magnitude because of the smaller layer thickness, which was confirmed by XRD (the layer spacing decreased to 9.08 angstrom of MA(2)PbI(4) from 13.39 angstrom of BA(2)PbI(4)). In addition, theoretical calculations and experimental analysis reveal that the MA(2)PbI(4) perovskite possesses a narrow band gap, good conductivity, and a low trap density. As a result, the PCE of the 2D PSCs reached 16.92%, and the certified efficiency was 16.6% according to the National Institute of Metrology (NIM), the highest efficiency value so far for 2D PSCs. Furthermore, the MA(2)PbI(4) devices exhibited superior long-term stability under illumination and exposure to environmental conditions. The PCEs of the 2D perovskite devices without encapsulation degraded by only 2.2% from their initial values when exposed to ambient conditions at similar to 55% relative humidity for 1512 hours. Meanwhile, the efficiency remained 97.2% of its initial value when the device was continuously illuminated for 500 hours at 60 degrees C in argon. Even after following the illumination test with light-soaking for over 500 h in ambient air, the PCE of the unsealed device suffered only a minor degradation of 3.8%.

Two-dimensional Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) perovskite solar cells exhibit excellent stability but suffer from low photovoltaic performance so far. Herein, a RP/3D heterostructure passivated by semiconducting molecules is reported, which systematically addresses both charge dynamics and degradation mechanisms in concert for cesium-free FAPbI(3) solar cells, delivering a power-conversion efficiency as high as 20.62% and remarkable long-term ambient stability with a t(80) lifetime exceeding 2880 hours without encapsulation. In situ characterizations were carried out to gain insight into structural evolution and crystal growth mechanisms during spin coating. Comprehensive film and device characterizations were performed to understand the influences of the RP perovskite and molecule passivation on the film quality, photovoltaic performance and degradation mechanisms. This enables fabrication of a superior quality film with significantly improved optoelectronic properties, which lead to higher charge collection efficiency. The underlying mitigated degradation mechanisms of the passivated RP/3D devices were further elucidated. The understanding of the necessity of addressing both the charge dynamics and degradation mechanisms of solar cells will guide the future design and fabrication of chemically stable, high-efficiency photovoltaic devices.

Here, we investigated the cooperation of a Lewis base and a Lewis acid by combining commercial bis-PCBM mixed isomers as the Lewis acid in the antisolvent and N-(4-bromophenyl)thiourea (BrPh-ThR) as the Lewis base in the perovskite solution precursor. The combination of the Lewis base and the Lewis acid synergistically passivates Pb2+ and PbX3- antisite defects, enlarges the perovskite grain size, and improves charge-carrier separation and transport, leading to improved device efficiency from 19.3% to 21.7%. In addition, this Lewis base and acid combination also suppresses moisture incursion and passivates pinholes generated in the hole-transporting layer. The unsealed devices remained at 93% of the initial efficiency value in ambient air (10-20% relative humidity) after 3600 h at 20-25 degrees C and dropped by 10% after 1500 h under continuous operation at 1-sun illumination and 55 degrees C in nitrogen with maximum power-point tracking.

However, the lack of high-quality low-bandgap perovskite absorber layers seriously hampers the development of efficient and stable two-terminal monolithic all-perovskite tandem solar cells. Here, we report a bulk-passivation strategy via incorporation of chlorine, to enlarge grains and reduce electronic disorder in mixed tin-lead low-bandgap (similar to 1.25 eV) perovskite absorber layers. This enables the fabrication of efficient low-bandgap perovskite solar cells using thick absorber layers (similar to 750 nm), which is a requisite for efficient tandem solar cells. Such improvement enables the fabrication of two-terminal all-perovskite tandem solar cells with a champion power conversion efficiency of 21% and steady-state efficiency of 20.7%. The efficiency is retained to 85% of its initial performance after 80 h of operation under continuous illumination.

This article reports the effect of photogenerated dipoles in the electron transport layer (ETL) on the photovoltaic actions in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). A nonfullerene material ITIC with optically induced dipoles was doped into PCBM acting as ETL in inverted planar structure PSCs (ITO/PEDOT: PSS/MAPbI(3-x)Cl(x)/ETL/PEI/Ag). The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs increases from 13.48% to 14.52% with introducing ITIC into ETL. The capacitance measurements indicate that optically induced dipoles can decrease interfacial charge accumulation. Furthermore, impedance spectroscopy suggests the charge recombination as well as ionic migration are reduced with ITIC doped ETL. Steady and transient PL spectra reveal that the electron extraction is more efficient with optically induced dipoles in the ETL. These results provide unique design of ETL in perovskite solar cells.

IPA solvent annealing (IPA SA) of PbI2 films was carried out at different temperatures. The grain size, compactness, roughness and morphology of PbI2 and CH3NH3PbI3 films were seriously affected by annealing methods. Similarly, weakly coordinating solvent annealing process was also employed to anneal all inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite in a one-step method. A continuous and dense CsPbI3 film with uniform grain size was obtained. We recognized that weakly coordinating solvent annealing for perovskite could regulate the dissolution-recrystallization process via controlling the volume of residual solvent in perovskite intermediate films. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of conventional CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) reached 17.4% and that of CsPbI3 PSCs reached 2.5% based on this sequential IPA SA process.

However, the annealing temperature higher than 90 degrees C is mandatory to produce high quality perovskite films. Here, for the first time, the use of an ultra-thin self-assembly monolayer (SAM) of methoxysilane on ZnO ETL to suppress the decomposition of perovskite films is reported. A self-form solvent annealing (SFSA) method is also carried out to improve the crystal quality of perovskite, and the champion device of SAM modified ZnO based PSCs yields a PCE of 18.34%. All these processes are conducted at low temperature and compatible with fabrication of flexible devices.

In particular, inorganic halide perovskite nanomaterials provide controllable morphology, tunable optoelectronic properties, and improved quantum efficiency. Here, the development controlled synthesis of desired inorganic halide perovskite nanostructures by various chemical approaches is described. Utilizing these nanostructures as platforms, anion exchange chemistry for wide compositional and optical tunabilities is described, and the rich structural phase transition phenomenon and mechanism investigated systematically. Furthermore, these nanostructures and extracted knowledge are applied to design photonic, photovoltaic, and thermoelectric devices. Finally, future directions and challenges toward improvement of the optical, electrical, and optoelectronic properties, exploration of the anion and cation exchange kinetics, and alleviation of the stability and toxicity issues in inorganic lead based halide perovskites are discussed to provide an outlook on this promising field.

Three applications of ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy of semiconductor thin films: spectroelectrochemistry, microscopy, and identification of thermal contributions	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C			English	Review							CHARGE-CARRIER DYNAMICS; HEMATITE PHOTOANODES; PEROVSKITE FILMS; SINGLET FISSION; SOLAR-CELL; FEMTOSECOND; RECOMBINATION; POLYMER; PROBE; PHOTOELECTROCHEMISTRY	This review describes three recent developments in ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy that have revealed new insights into the dynamics of photogenerated charge carriers in solution-processed semiconductor thin films. Transient absorption spectroelectrochemistry, in which transient absorption spectra are collected on a semiconductor film immersed in electrolyte solution under an applied potential, provides information about the dependence of transport of photogenerated charges on interfacial electronic structure. Ultrafast transient absorption microscopy enables measurement of excited state dynamics with sub-micron spatial resolution, which has been used to investigate the influence of film morphology on local excited state dynamics and image directly charge transport in solution-processed organic and hybrid organic-inorganic lead-halide perovskite semiconducting films. Finally, the recent identification of significant thermal contributions to the transient absorption spectra of organic and metal oxide semiconductor films is discussed, along with its potential implications for future measurements.

Polymers with hydroxyl functional groups greatly improve the uniformity of the composite films, and large area dense films are obtained using a simple drop-casting process. X-ray detectors based on the composite films exhibit a sensitivity of 40 C Gy(air)(-1) cm(-2), comparable to the reported sensitivity using Cs2AgBiBr6 single crystals. Such detectors can also tolerate a 5% tensile/compressive strain in the composite films without performance degradation. Pixelated X-ray detectors fabricated on the same composite film can realize X-ray imaging and resolve a proof-of-concept geometric pattern.

To incorporate organic chain polymers into the OIHPs based photo-active polycrystalline films seems to be a unique strategy to passivate naturally formed defects at grain boundaries and surfaces, to prevent surface oxidation, and consequently, to optimize photovoltaic performance, as well as to tackle with device instability. In this work, a Lewis-type organic insulating polymer, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), was utilized as an effective additive in formamidinium tin tri-iodide (FASnI(3)) precursor solutions, and the corresponding solid films were made by a one-step processing method. By tuning different concentrations of PMMA, the solar cells have exhibited remarkable improvements of V-oc and FF by comparing with a control device without PMMA. The role of PMMA is functional for surface morphology optimization, trap density (n(t)) reduction and current density-voltage (J-V) hysteresis elimination. As a result, it is helpful to effectively impede degradation speeds of FASnI(3) based solar cells.

Photovoltaic Effect in Indium(I) Iodide Thin Films	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; PHASE; EFFICIENCY; GROWTH	Halide semiconductors are undergoing a period of intense interest, buoyed by the outstanding optoelectronic properties of hybrid perovskites. It is worthwhile to consider whether related materials sharing unique aspects of the perovskite chemistry, such as the incorporation of metals that provide lone pair s electrons when integrated within the halide lattice, might yield semiconductors with comparable properties. One such metal that has not been widely studied in the context of photovoltaics is monovalent indium. In this work, we investigate a method of depositing films of indium(I) iodide, coupled with optoelectronic characterization and incorporation of these films into thin-film solar cells. We find that, although indium(I) iodide exhibits a photovoltaic effect, it is likely to be compromised by difficult-to-remove defects, e.g., iodine vacancies, which are expected to introduce recombination centers deep within the band gap.

A variety of pendant functionalities are introduced to 1, including azobenzene (6) and triarylamines (5ae). The extent of incorporation depends on the nucleophilicity of the parent aniline. Polymer 6 exhibits a UV-induced trans -> cis photoisomerization and has lower rates of photoinduced decomposition relative to parent 1. Triarylamine-containing polymers 5a-e are redox-active, forming optically active radical cations upon chemical oxidation. Compared with model N-arylpyrrole compounds 9a-e, polymers 5a-e demonstrate hypsochromic shifts in UV-vis absorptions and exhibit features between +0.5 and +1.2 V (vs Ag/AgCl) in solution-phase differential pulse voltammetry.

Here we show that free charges in OIHPs, whether generated by incident light or by current-injection from electrodes, can reduce their stability, while efficient charge extraction effectively stabilizes the perovskite materials. The excess of both holes and electrons reduce the activation energy for ion migration within OIHPs, accelerating the degradation of OIHPs, while the excess holes and electrons facilitate the migration of cations or anions, respectively. OIHP solar cells capable of efficient charge-carrier extraction show improved light stability under regular operation conditions compared to an open-circuit condition where the photo-generated charges are confined in the perovskite layers.

Surface potential properties of TiO2 nanoparticle film coated on the ITO-LiNbO3 (TiO2/ITO-LiNbO3) examined by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) confirmed that a large electric field (a few 10 V/mu m) generated from LiNbO3 can penetrate through the ITO layer and is applied to TiO2 film. This polarization-induced electric field leads to an increased photocurrent density by attracting and promoting electrons to direct transport through the mesoporous TiO2 network toward the collector electrode and a decreased charge recombination by facilitating electrons to pass through fewer boundaries of nanoparticles, resulting in high power conversion efficiency. The power conversion efficiency was enhanced by more than 40% in comparison with that without polarization-induced electric field. Incorporating functional ferroelectrics into photovoltaic cells would be a good strategy in improving photovoltaic performance and is applicable to other types of photovoltaic devices, such as perovskite solar cells.

To achieve these impressive numbers, the PSC scientific community is working to improve both the perovskite optoelectronic properties, and, importantly, the interfacial properties of the adjacent electron selective contacts (ESLs). Improvements in both fronts have happened concurrently and are responsible for these rapid efficiency gains. Here, the authors review the recent advances in understanding the role of ESLs on performance improvements. ESLs can be prepared from either organic and inorganic semiconductors, or a combination of both, and their key characteristics are summarized in detail. Current state-of-the-art PSCs employ fully inorganic ESLs made of a thin mesoporous TiO2 or a planar SnO2, with reported certified efficiencies of 22.7 and 20.9%, respectively. While TiO2 shows excellent performance in the short term, it has also been shown to induce solar cell degradation due to its UV absorption properties. Understanding ESLs has been instrumental in the rapid development of PSCs; however, some challenges remain in terms of understanding the role of different ESLs on the long-term stability of the devices.

Dynamic Disorder, Band Gap Widening, and Persistent Near-IR Photoluminescence up to At Least 523 K in ASnI(3) Perovskites (A = Cs+, CH3NH3+ and NH2-CH=NH2+)	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							FORMAMIDINIUM TIN IODIDE; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; SOLAR-CELLS; CARRIER LIFETIMES; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; ORGANIC CATIONS; FABRICATION; SEMICONDUCTOR; LUMINESCENCE	We report temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) in polycrystalline ASnI(3) perovskites (A = Cs+, CH3NH3+, and HC(NH2)(2)(+)), demonstrating extremely robust emission up to very high temperatures (523 K for CsSnI3). The PL peak energy (E-PL) monotonically blueshifts with increasing temperature, indicating band gap widening. Variable temperature synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction analysis confirms that these changes are associated with progressive emphanitic off-centering and dynamic fluctuations of the perovskite lattice. In CsSnI3, three different temperature gradients of E-PL are defined (0.29 meV K-1 below 200 K, 0.17 meV K-1 from 200 to 400 K, and 0.48 meV K-1 above 400 K), commensurate with the onset of dynamic structural disorder at 200 K and its saturation at 400 K as the Cs+ atoms rattle independently of the [SnI3](-) perovskite lattice. These results explain how solution-processed perovskites with massive defect concentrations can yield high optoelectronic performance at elevated temperatures.

Fullerene-based perovskite solar cells produce no hysteresis and do not require high-temperature annealing. However, high power conversion efficiency has been only achieved when the fullerene layer is thermally evaporated, which is an expensive process. In this work, the limitations of a solution-processed fullerene layer have been identified as high crystallinity and the presence of remnant solvents, in contrast to a thermally deposited C-60 film, which has low crystallinity and no remaining solvents. As a solution to these problems, a mixed C-60 and C-70 solution-processed film, which exhibits low crystallinity, is proposed as an electron-transporting layer. The mixed-fullerene-based devices produce power conversion efficiencies as high as that of the thermally evaporated C-60-based device (16.7%) owing to improved fill factor and open-circuit voltage. In addition, by vacuum-drying the mixed fullerene film, the power conversion efficiency of the solution-processed perovskite solar cells is further improved to 18.0%. This improvement originates from the enhanced transmittance and charge transport by removing the solvent effect. This simple and low-cost method can be easily used in any type of solar cells with fullerene as the electron-transporting layer.

Herein, we report a practical grain boundary modification to remarkably improve the humidity and thermal stability by gradually growing in situ two-dimensional nanoplates between the grain boundaries of perovskite films using phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAT). The experimental results show that PEAL nanoplates play a critical role in stabilizing perovskite thin films by reducing the moisture sensitivity and suppressing phase transition at the grain boundaries. In addition to the significant improved ambient stability, the grain boundary modification by PEAL can effectively suppress the nonradiative charge recombination at grain boundaries. As a result, the efficiency of perovskite solar cells is up to 20.34% with significant humidity and thermal stability.

In this work, we have demonstrated CsPbl(3) perovskite quantum dot (QD) solar cells with a remarkable efficiency approaching 13% and an extremely low energy loss of 0.45 eV by employing a series of dopant-free polymeric hole-transporting materials (HTMs). The CsPbl(3) QD solar cells use polymer HTMs to achieve efficient charge extraction at QD/polymer interfaces and avoid device instability caused by complex doping and oxidation processes required by conventional Spiro-OMeTAD. Meanwhile, the CsPbl(3) QD photovoltaic devices can be fabricated at room temperature and exhibit more reproducible film quality, showing potential advantages over current all-inorganic perovskite solar cells. We believe that our findings will catalyze the development of new device structures, specifically for perovskite QDs, and help realize the promising potential of all-inorganic perovskite solar cells.

In situ X-ray diffraction during film deposition and thermal conversion gave insight into the formation of crystalline inter-mediates, essential for high-quality films. Parameters were optimized based on the in situ study, allowing perovskite films to be annealed within 3s with a champion power conversion efficiency of 16.8%. This opens up a clear pathway to-ward industrial-scale high-throughput manufacturing, which is required to fulfill the projected photovoltaic installation rates needed to reach climate goals.

Ultra-stable 2D layered methylammonium cadmium trihalide perovskite photoelectrodes	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							HOLE EXTRACTION LAYERS; HALIDE PEROVSKITE; HIGHLY EFFICIENT; SOLAR-CELLS; LENGTHS; OPTIMIZATION; PERFORMANCE; MOBILITIES	For the first of time, we demonstrate that methylammonium cadmium halides show photoelectrochemical (PEC) response with excellent humidity and chemical resistance because the oxidation state of almost all cadmium compounds is +2. The photocurrent densities of two-dimensional (2D) layered (MA)(2)CdCl4 perovskites are about 0.30 mA cm(-2) under 100 mW cm(-2) irradiation. The interaction between these methylammonium cadmium halides and water vapor is studied by probing film morphology and characterizing single crystal structure. It is shown that H2O is able to complex with the perovskite, forming a hydrate product with the molecular formula of MACd(3)Cl(7)3H(2)O upon humidity exposure. This causes a decrease in absorption and a recognizable change in the crystal structure of the material. When compared to methyl-ammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)), the PEC stability of 2D layered (MA)(2)CdCl4 perovskites with BQ/BQ(-) redox couples (where BQ is benzoquinone) in CH2Cl2 is enhanced from 50 hours to 600 hours, exhibiting an increase of 12 times.

In the case of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)), deep level traps limit efficiency by participating in charge carrier recombination. Prior work has shown that the solar cell efficiency of MAPbI(3) solar cells varied significantly with deposition method; specifically, efficiencies of 13.5 and 17.7% were observed for MAPbI(3) processed with a one- and two-step method, respectively. However, the origin of the difference in efficiency remains unclear. In this study, we analyze the interplay between deep level traps and efficiency by simulating the photoexcited charge carrier pathway across solar cells processed via the one- and two-step method using finite-element drift-diffusion modeling. We determined that in the case of one-step processing, the traps propagate throughout the bulk, while for two-step, the traps congregate at the interface where the MAPbI(3) was grown (mesoporous TiO2). Composition and structural analysis are used to propose a plausible explanation as to why the difference in processing changes the spatial distribution of the traps.

Control of Charge Recombination in Perovskites by Oxidation State of Halide Vacancy	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							METHYLAMMONIUM-LEAD IODIDE; OPEN-CIRCUIT VOLTAGE; AB-INITIO; SOLAR-CELLS; HYBRID PEROVSKITES; DEFECT TOLERANCE; TRAP STATES; ELECTRONIC EXCITATIONS; TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE; CARRIER DYNAMICS	Advances in perovskite solar cells require development of means to control and eliminate the nonradiative charge recombination pathway. Using ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, we demonstrate that charge recombination in perovskites is extremely sensitive to the charge state of the halogen vacancy. A missing iodine anion in MAPbI(3) has almost no effect on charge losses. However, when the vacancy is reduced, the recombination is accelerated by up to 2 orders of magnitude. The acceleration occurs due to formation of a deep hole trap in the singly reduced vacancy, and both deep and shallow hole traps for the doubly reduced vacancy. The shallow hole involves a significant rearrangement of the Pb-I lattice, leading to a new chemical species: a Pb-Pb dimer bound by the vacancy charge, and under-coordinated iodine bonds. Hole trapping by the singly reduced iodide vacancy operates parallel to recombination of free electron and hole, accelerating charge losses by a factor of S. The doubly reduced vacancy acts by a sequential mechanism-free hole, to shallow trap, to deep trap, to free electron, and accelerates the recombination by a factor of 50. The study demonstrates that iodine anion vacancy can be beneficial to the performance, because it causes minor changes to the charge carrier lifetime, while increasing charge carrier concentration. However, the neutral iodine and iodine cation vacancies should be strongly avoided. The detailed insights into the charge carrier trapping and relaxation mechanisms provided by the simulation are essential for development of efficient photocatalytic, photovoltaic, optoelectronic and related devices.

Acoustic phonon lifetimes limit thermal transport in methylammonium lead iodide	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						hybrid perovskite; thermal conductivity; inelastic neutron spectroscopy; lattice dynamics; solar cells	CONDUCTIVITY; TRANSITIONS; PEROVSKITES; DECAY	Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) have become an important class of semiconductors for solar cells and other optoelectronic applications. Electron-phonon coupling plays a critical role in all optoelectronic devices, and although the lattice dynamics and phonon frequencies of HOIPs have been well studied, little attention has been given to phonon lifetimes. We report high-precision momentum-resolved measurements of acoustic phonon lifetimes in the hybrid perovskite methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI), using inelastic neutron spectroscopy to provide high-energy resolution and fully deuterated single crystals to reduce incoherent scattering from hydrogen. Our measurements reveal extremely short lifetimes on the order of picoseconds, corresponding to nanometer mean free paths and demonstrating that acoustic phonons are unable to dissipate heat efficiently. Lattice-dynamics calculations using ab initio third-order perturbation theory indicate that the short lifetimes stem from strong three-phonon interactions and a high density of low-energy optical phonon modes related to the degrees of freedom of the organic cation. Such short lifetimes have significant implications for electron-phonon coupling in MAPI and other HOIPs, with direct impacts on optoelectronic devices both in the cooling of hot carriers and in the transport and recombination of band edge carriers. These findings illustrate a fundamental difference between HOIPs and conventional photovoltaic semiconductors and demonstrate the importance of understanding lattice dynamics in the effort to develop metal halide perovskite optoelectronic devices.

Understanding the microscopic origins of high ionic conductivities has been complicated by indirect measurements and sample microstructural heterogeneities. Here, we report the direct visualization of halide anion interdiffusion in CsPbCl3-CsPbBr3 single crystalline perovskite nanowire heterojunctions using wide-field and confocal photoluminescence measurements. The combination of nanoscale imaging techniques with these single crystalline materials allows us to measure intrinsic anionic lattice diffusivities, free from complications of micro-scale inhomogeneity. Halide diffusivities were found to be between 10(-13) and similar to 10(-12) cm(2)/second at about 100 degrees C, which are several orders of magnitudes lower than those reported in polycrystalline thin films. Spatially resolved photoluminescence lifetimes and surface potential measurements provide evidence of the central role of halide vacancies in facilitating ionic diffusion. Vacancy formation free energies computed from molecular simulation are small due to the easily deformable perovskite lattice, accounting for the high equilibrium vacancy concentration. Furthermore, molecular simulations suggest that ionic motion is facilitated by low-frequency lattice modes, resulting in low activation barriers for vacancy-mediated transport. This work elucidates the intrinsic solid-state ion diffusion mechanisms in this class of semisoft materials and offers guidelines for engineering materials with long-term stability in functional devices.

Precise Control of Thermal and Redox Properties of Organic Hole-Transport Materials	ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION			English	Article						glass transition temperature; hole-transport materials; organic semiconductors; perovskite solar cells; solar energy	PEROVSKITE SOLAR-CELLS; LOW-COST; EFFICIENT; STABILITY; MOBILITY	We report design principles of the thermal and redox properties of synthetically accessible spiro-based hole transport materials (HTMs) and show the relevance of these findings to high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The chemical modification of an asymmetric spiro[ fluorene-9,9'-xanthene] core is amenable to selective placement of redox active triphenylamine (TPA) units. We therefore leveraged computational techniques to investigate five HTMs bearing TPAgroups judiciously positioned about this asymmetric spiro core. It was determined that TPA groups positioned about the conjugated fluorene moiety increase the free energy change for holeextraction from the perovskite layer, while TPAs about the xanthene unit govern the T-g values. The synergistic effects of these characteristics resulted in an HTM characterized by both a low reduction potential (approximate to 0.7V vs. NHE) and a high T-g value (> 1258 degrees C) to yield a device power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.8% in a PSC.

The introduced PFTBT exhibits high absorbance in the UV region and high conductivity which increases the device absorbance and the efficiency of carrier mobility. Besides, PFTBT acts as traps which can increase the concentration of the majority carrier. Therefore, the doped device exhibits high responsivity and high specific detectivity with the value of 0.22 A W-1 and 1.78 x 10(12) Jones which respectively has a 3.6 and 2.6 times greater enhancement than the device without doping. The response time is also improved from 27 ms to 22 ms. Owing to the different absorbances that the materials have, the PD has a narrow detection range from 320 nm to 340 nm which is helpful to the study of the specific wavelength. In other words, the research provides a potential way to fabricate practical high-performance UVPDs.

Herein an HTM (EDOT-Amide-TPA) is reported in which a functional amide-based backbone is introduced, which allows this material to be synthesized in a simple condensation reaction with an estimated cost of <$5 g(-1). When employed in perovskite solar cells, EDOT-Amide-TPA demonstrates stabilized power conversion efficiencies up to 20.0% and reproducibly outperforms Spiro-OMeTAD in direct comparisons. Time resolved microwave conductivity measurements indicate that the observed improvement originates from a faster hole injection rate from the perovskite to EDOT-Amide-TPA. Additionally, the devices exhibit an improved lifetime, which is assigned to the coordination of the amide bond to the Li-additive, offering a novel strategy to hamper the migration of additives. It is shown that, despite the lack of a conjugated backbone, the amide-based HTM can outperform state-of-the-art HTMs at a fraction of the cost, thereby providing a novel set of design strategies to develop new, low-cost HTMs.	[Petrus, Michiel L.; Sirtl, Maximilian T.; Closs, Anna C.; Bein, Thomas] Univ Munich LMU, Dept Chem, Butenandtstr 11, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Petrus, Michiel L.; Sirtl, Maximilian T.; Closs, Anna C.; Bein, Thomas] Univ Munich LMU, Ctr NanoSci CeNS, Butenandtstr 11, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Schutt, Kelly; Snaith, Henry] Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Clarendon Lab, Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PU, England; [Hutter, Eline M.; Savenije, Tom J.] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Chem Engn, Maasweg 9, NL-2629 HZ Delft, Netherlands; [Ball, James M.; Petrozza, Annamaria] Ist Italiano Tecnol, Ctr Nano Sci & Technol Polimi, Via Giovanni Pascoli 70-3, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Bijleveld, Johan C.] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Aerosp Engn, Kluyverweg 1, NL-2629 HS Delft, Netherlands; [Dingemans, Theo J.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Appl Phys Sci, Murray Hall 1113,121 South Rd, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Docampo, Pablo] Newcastle Univ, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England	Petrus, ML (reprint author), Univ Munich LMU, Dept Chem, Butenandtstr 11, D-81377 Munich, Germany.; Petrus, ML (reprint author), Univ Munich LMU, Ctr NanoSci CeNS, Butenandtstr 11, D-81377 Munich, Germany.; Docampo, P (reprint author), Newcastle Univ, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.	michiel.petrus@cup.lmu.de; pablo.docampo@newcastle.ac.uk	Snaith, Henry J/A-7367-2016	Snaith, Henry J/0000-0001-8511-790X; Hutter, Eline/0000-0002-5537-6545; Bijleveld, Johan/0000-0002-6844-3719	Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [03SF0516B]; Bavarian Collaborative Research Program "Solar Technologies Go Hybrid" (SolTech); Center for NanoScience (CeNS); DFG Excellence Cluster "Nanosystems Initiative Munich" (NIM); Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO); Marshall Aid Commemoration Commission	The authors acknowledge Dr. Steffen Schmidt for the SEM images.

Many efforts have been made to study their structures in the search for a better mechanistic understanding to guide the materials optimization. Here, we investigate the structure instability of the single-crystalline CH(3)NH(3)Pbl(3) (MAPbl(3)) film by using transmission electron microscopy. We find that MAPbl(3) is very sensitive to the electron beam illumination and rapidly decomposes into the hexagonal Pbl(2). We propose a decomposition pathway, initiated with the loss of iodine ions, resulting in eventual collapse of perovskite structure and its decomposition into Pbl(2). These findings impose important question on the interpretation of experimental data based on electron diffraction and highlight the need to circumvent material decomposition in future electron microscopy studies. The structural evolution during decomposition process also sheds light on the structure instability of organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites in solar cell applications.

Ion migrations are believed to be relevant. But the atomistic details still remain unclear. Here we study the migrations of ions in CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI(3)) at varying temperatures (T's), using combined experimental and first-principle theoretical methods. Classical hopping of the iodide ions is the main migration mechanism at moderate T's. Below similar to 270 K, the kinetic constant for ionic migration still shows an Arrenhius dependency, but the much lower activation energy is attributed to the migration of H+. A gradual classical-to-quantum transition takes place between similar to 140 and similar to 80 K. Below similar to 80 K, the kinetic constant becomes T-independent, suggesting that deep quantum tunneling of H+ takes over. This study gives direct experimental evidence for the migrations of H(+)s in MAPbI(3) and confirms their quantum nature.

However, their broad band gap makes them unsuitable for single-junction solar cells, which spurred researchers to design new strategies to narrow the band gap and broaden their photovoltaic application. Herein, a general doping strategy was designed to obtain lead-free and large size Sn-doped MA(3)Sb(2)I(9) single crystals. Their crystal structures and valence states were investigated in detail by X-ray diffraction and the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, revealing distinct lattice expansion, thus demonstrating the successful doping of Sn2+. After the doping of Sn2+, a significant 296 nm red-shifted light absorption peak was clearly observed, and the carrier mobility enhanced by about two-fold, as investigated by space charge-limited current (SCLC) and Hall effect measurements. The trend of the band gap determined by the first-principles calculations matches well with that of experiments.

Myths and reality of HPbI3 in halide perovskite solar cells	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							ORGANIC-INORGANIC PEROVSKITES; HYBRID PEROVSKITES; PHASE-TRANSITION; THIN-FILMS; EFFICIENT; STABILITY; PRECURSOR; TIN; FORMAMIDINIUM; ALPHA-CSPBI3	All-inorganic perovskites have a special place in halide perovskite family because of their potential for better stability. However, the representative cesium lead iodide (CsPbI3) is metastable and spontaneously converts to the non-perovskite structure at room temperature. Here, we demonstrate that what appears to be all-inorganic CsPbI3 stabilized in its perovskite form using the purported intermediate known as hydrogen lead iodide (HPbI3) is, in fact, the hybrid perovskite cesium dimethylammonium lead iodide (Cs(1-x)DMA(x)PbI(3), x = 0.2 to 0.5). Thus, many of the reported all-inorganic perovskites are actually still hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites, as strongly evidenced by a wide battery of experimental techniques presented here. Solar cells based on the representative composition Cs(0.7)DMA(0.3)PbI(3) can achieve an average power conversion efficiency of 9.27 +/- 1.28% (max 12.62%). These results provide an alternative angle to look at previous results pertaining all-inorganic CsPbI3 while the DMA cation is now revealed as an alternative A site cation.

Unravelling the Improved Electronic and Structural Properties of Methylammonium Lead Iodide Deposited from Acetonitrile	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							HYBRID PEROVSKITES; METHYLAMINE; CRYSTALLIZATION; DECOMPOSITION; PERFORMANCE; IMPACT; ENERGY; FILMS	Perovskite-based photovoltaics are an emerging solar technology with lab scale device efficiencies of over 22 %, and significant steps are being made toward their commercialization. Conventionally high efficiency perovskite solar cells are formed from high boiling point, polar aprotic solvent solutions. Methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) films can be made from a range of solvents and blends; however, the role the solvent system plays in determining the properties of the resulting perovskite films is poorly understood. Acetonitrile (ACN), in the presence of methylamine (MA), is a viable nontoxic solvent for fabrication of CH3NH3PbI3 photovoltaic devices with efficiencies >18 %. Herein we examine films prepared from ACN/MA and dimethylformamide (DMF) and scrutinize their physical and electronic properties using spectroscopy, scanning probe imaging, and ion scattering. Significant differences are observed in the chemistry and electronic structure of CH3NH3PbI3 films made with each solvent, ACN/MA produces films with superior properties resulting in more efficient photovoltaic devices. Here we present a holistic and complete understanding of a high performance perovskite material from an electronic, physical, and structural perspective and establish a robust toolkit with which to understand and optimize photovoltaic perovskites.

This study demonstrated that adhesive encapsulation by employing commercial which and tape, polyimide significantly simultaneously improved the water resistance and thermal stability of MAPbI((3-x))Br(x) perovskite films and PSCs. The stable operation of encapsulated PSCs in water with a power conversion efficiency of 19.1% was achieved, which was slightly higher than that of the device in air (18.2%). The devices with a stable power output could retain 96.3% of their initial efficiency in water for 1620 s under continuous illumination. In addition, the encapsulated MAPbI((3-x))Br(x) films could retain their tetragonal perovskite crystal structure after being heated at 240 degrees C for 180 min in an ambient environment. This adhesive encapsulation offers an avenue to improve the stability of halide perovskite devices for future commercialization.

Rotationally Free and Rigid Sublattices of the Single Crystal Perovskite CH3NH3 PbBr3 (001): The Case of the Lattice Polar Liquid	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							SURFACE DEBYE TEMPERATURE; SOLAR-CELLS; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; FERROELECTRIC POLARIZATION; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; LEAD BROMIDE; DISORDER; NANOCRYSTALS; SEPARATION; HYSTERESIS	The dynamic motion, within the lattice of single crystal CH3NH3PbBr3 (001) hybrid halide perovskite, was investigated using powder and single crystal X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy. Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies indicate the methylammonium cation adopts multiple orientations within the crystal, at room temperature, evidence of a disordered methylammonium sublattice within a rigid and ordered PbBr3 matrix lattice. From the Br (3)d(5)/(2) core level photoemission temperature dependence, an effective Debye temperature of 160 +/- 22 K can be estimated, while the Pb 4f(7/2) core-level Debye-Waller factor plots suggest an effective Debye temperature of 202 +/- 131 K, indicative of a very rigid lattice along the (001) direction. The combination of X-ray diffraction with temperature dependent X-ray photoemission spectroscopy for bromine and lead core level peaks supports the characterization of CH3NH3PbBr3 as a lattice polar liquid crystal, as CH3NH3PbBr3 does not meet the criteria required for a ferroelectric material.

Tunable Electrical and Optical Properties of Nickel Oxide (NiOx) Thin Films for Fully Transparent NiOx-Ga2O3 p-n Junction Diodes	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						oxide semiconductors; pn junction; pulsed laser deposition; nickel oxide; gallium oxide	PEROVSKITE SOLAR-CELLS; SPUTTERED NIO; LAYER; TEMPERATURE; FABRICATION; CONTACT	One of the major limitations of oxide semi-conductors technology is the lack of proper p-type materials to enable devices such as pn junctions, light-emitting diodes, and photodetectors. This limitation has resulted in an increased research focus on these materials. In this work, p-type NiOx thin films with tunable optical and electrical properties as well as its dependence with oxygen pressure during pulsed laser deposition are demonstrated. The control of NiOx films resistivity ranged from similar to 10(9) to similar to 10(2) Omega cm, showing a p-type behavior with E-g tuning from 3.4 to 3.9 eV. Chemical composition and the resulting band diagrams are also discussed. The all-oxide NiOx-Ga2O3 pn junction showed very low leakage current, an ideality factor of similar to 2, 10(5) on/off ratio, and 0.6 V built-in potential. Its J-V temperature dependence is also analyzed. C-V measurements demonstrate diodes with a carrier concentration of 10(15) cm(-3) for the Ga2O3 layer, which is fully depleted. These results show a stable, promising diode, attractive for future photoelectronic devices.	[Pintor-Monroy, Maria Isabel; Barrera, Diego; Murillo-Borjas, Bayron L.; Hsu, Julia W.

The controllable growth of 2D perovskites with desired shapes would be critical for improving the performance of 2D perovskite-based optoelectronic devices. However, the investigation on this is still in its infancy. Here, we report on the controllable synthesis of 2D (C4H9NH3)(2)PbI4 microstructures with a butterfly shape, (C4H9NH3)(2)(CH3NH3)Pb2I7 and (C4H9NH3)(2)PbI4/(C4H9NH3)(2)(CH3NH3)Pb2I7 microstructures with a square shape by a solution-processing method. We have systematically investigated the influence of the substrate, mass ratio and crystallization temperature on the morphology evolution of the as-synthesized 2D perovskite microstructures. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and optical microscopy (OM) images show that the size and thickness of the resultant products are positively correlated with their mass ratio and negatively correlated with their crystallization temperature. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, fluorescence imaging, temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) and absorption studies confirm the crystalline structures and optical properties of the as-synthesized regularly shaped 2D perovskite microstructures. Our studies provide a simple method to controllably synthesize 2D perovskite microstructures without using very toxic solvents and thus offer a platform to investigate the optical and charge transport properties of 2D perovskite materials for the further design of new device architectures with enhanced performance.

However, its practical application is restricted by the low energy conversion efficiency and poor stability of photocatalysts. Herein, we report the realization of highly efficient overall water splitting promoted by bifunctional bimetallic phosphide (Ni0.5Co0.5P) nanowire arrays vertically grown on carbon paper (Ni0.5Co0.5P/CP) and driven by highly stable all-inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The Ni0.5Co0.5P/CP electrocatalysts can provide abundant active sites, high electrical conductivity, and good contact interface with the electrolyte, thus showing remarkable activity and great durability for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The electrolyzer assembled with both the Ni0.5Co0.5P/CP anode and cathode can afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at only 1.61 V and allow consecutive water splitting.

Nevertheless, the use of the toxic element Pb is still a big challenge for the mass production of highly efficient perovskite solar cells. In this work, a novel and facile technique is presented to fabricate tin-lead alloyed perovskite films using metal precursors and a substitution method. Herein, the perovskite films are formed as a result of the substitution reaction between the Sn metal precursor and methylammonium triiodideplumbate (CH3NH3PbI3, MAPbI(3)) solution carried out at 70 degrees C. The maximum Sn content in perovskite films reaches up to 15% with a substitution reaction time period of 1 day. Through this substitution technique and the unique growth mechanism, a less-toxic and efficient perovskite solar cell with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.46% is fabricated. It is found that this substituting strategy can exploit a new direction to further explore different active metals substituting less active organic metallic systems with even lower temperature conditions.

Among their attributes are solution processability, high absorbance in the visible spectral range, and defect tolerance, as manifested in long photocarrier lifetimes and diffusion lengths. The microscopic origin of photophysical properties of perovskites is, however, still unclear and under debate. Here, we observe an interesting universal scaling behavior in a series of (hybrid and all-inorganic) perovskite single crystals investigated via simultaneous measurements of the Hall effect, photoconductivity, and photoluminescence. A clear correlation between photoconductivity and photoluminescence as functions of the incident photon flux is observed. While photoconductivity exhibits a crossover in the power-law dependence between power exponents 1 and 1/2, photoluminescence exhibits a crossover between power exponents 2 and 3/2. This correlation is found in all the studied compounds regardless of the cation type (organic or inorganic) or crystallographic phases. We propose phenomenological microscopic mechanisms that explain these interesting nontrivial power exponents and crossovers between them in this broad class of lead-halide perovskites.

However, the fundamental understanding of the photophysics in perovskite remains elusive. In this work, we have revealed two distinct states in MAPbI(3) thin films at low temperature through time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy (TRPL). In particular, we observed a photo-induced carrier injection from the high energy (HE) state to the low energy (LE) state which has a longer lifetime. The strong interaction between the two states, evidenced by the injection kinetics, can be sensitively controlled through the excitation power. Understanding of the interacting two-states not only sheds light on the long PL lifetime in perovskite but also helps to understand the different behavior of perovskite in response to different excitation power. Further efforts in modifying the low energy state could significantly improve the quantum efficiency and lead to novel application in optoelectronics based on perovskite.

Previously, resonant metallic NPs have been incorporated into perovskite solar cells for better light absorption and charge separation. However, high inherent optical losses and high reactivity of noble metals with halides in perovskites are main limiting factors for this approach. Incidentally, low-loss and chemically inert resonant silicon NPs allow for light trapping and enhancement at nanoscale, being suitable for thin film photovoltaics. Here photocurrent and fill-factor (FF) enhancements in meso-superstructured perovskite solar cells, incorporating resonant silicon NPs between mesoporous TiO2 transport and active layers, are demonstrated. This results in a boost of device efficiency up to 18.8% and FF up to 79%, being a record among the previously reported values on NPs incorporation into CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite-based solar cells. Theoretical modeling and optical characterization reveal the significant role of Si NPs for increased light absorption in the active layer rather than for better charge separation. The proposed strategy is universal and can be applied in perovskite solar cells with various compositions, as well as in other optoelectronic devices.

We discuss the transformation mechanism in detail. More interestingly, the transformed samples in black can rapidly self-heal into yellow ones when exposed to deionized water (DI water). Contrary to other hybrid perovskites, DMASnI(3) crystals exhibit excellent water phase stability. For example, DMASnI(3) was immersed in DI water for 16h and no decomposition was observed. Inspired by its excellent water phase stability, we demonstrate a potential eco-friendly application of DMASnI(3) in photo-catalysis for H-2 evolution in DI water. We present the first H-2 evolution rate of 0.64 mol h(-1) with good recycling properties for pure DMASnI(3) crystals. After the narrowing process, the optical band gap of DMASnI(3) can be lowered from 2.48 eV to 1.32 eV. Systematical characterizations are applied to investigate their structures and optoelectronic properties. The reversible band gap narrowing behavior and outstanding electrical properties, such as higher carrier mobility and long carrier lifetime show that DMASnI(3) has a great potential for optoelectronic applications.

This process enables decoupling of the nucleation and the crystallization phases by inhibiting chemical reactions in as-cast precursor films rapidly cooled down by immersion in liquid nitrogen. The cooling is followed by blow-drying with nitrogen gas, which induces uniform precipitation of precursors due to the supersaturation of precursors in the residual solvents at very low temperature, while at the same time enhancing the evaporation of the residual solvents and preventing the ordered precursors/perovskite from redissolving into the residual solvents. Using the proposed techniques, the crystallization process can be initiated after the formation of a uniform precursor seed layer. The process is generally applicable to improve the performance of solar cells using perovskite films with different compositions, as demonstrated on three different types of mixed halide perovskites. A champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.4% with open-circuit voltage (V-OC) = 1.14 V, short-circuit current density ( J(SC)) = 23.5 mA cm(-2), and fill factor (FF) = 0.80 is achieved using the proposed cryogenic process.

These processes are thought to be influenced by structural inhomogeneities (e.g. interfaces and grain boundaries) bringing forward the necessity for development of techniques capable of correlating nanostructure and photo-transport behavior. While Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) is ideally suited to map surface potentials on relevant length scales, it lacks sufficient temporal resolution to extract the meaningful system dynamics. Here, we develop a time resolved surface photovoltage (SPV) measurement based on full information capture of the photodetector stream during open loop KPFM operation. G-Mode, or G-KPFM allows quantification of SPV with microsecond temporal and nanoscale spatial resolution. Using this technique, we observe concurrent spatial and fast temporal variations in the SPV generated across a methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) thin film, a possible indicator relating microstructure with heterogenous photo-transport behavior. We further demonstrate the advantage of adopting big data analytics including unsupervised clustering methods to quickly discern spatial variability in the information rich SPV dataset. Beyond G-KPFM, such clustering methods will be useful for interpretation of the multidimensional datasets arising from the growing number of time resolved KPFM approaches now available.

Rapid and Low-Temperature Processing of Mesoporous and Nanocrystalline TiO2 Film Using Microwave Irradiation	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						nanoporous TiO2; microwave irradiation; low temperature processing; dye-sensitized solar cell; microwave attenuation; fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO)	SENSITIZED SOLAR-CELLS; THIN-FILMS; SPRAY-PYROLYSIS; ANATASE; COST	Nanoporous (np)-TiO2 films have multiple applications, including dye-sensitized and perovskite solar cells. However, preparation of np-TiO2 films on transparent conductive oxide-coated surfaces (e.g., fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO)) requires high-temperature sintering (450-500 degrees C) for at least 30-60 min in a conventional oven. Here, we introduce a novel technique to rapidly produce np-TiO2 films on FTO-coated glass substrates via microwave (MW) irradiation. np-TiO2 films were sintered on FTO-glass substrates in less than 10 min at temperatures less than 260 degrees C using an optimized MW irradiation program and a simple MW attenuation technique. Significantly, cracking of FTO-coated glass substrates was avoided during MW irradiation, which was a limiting problem in previous studies. MW-developed films were evaluated with UV vis absorption spectrophotometry, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and atomic force microscopy, with MW-developed films (>4 min) producing essentially identical characteristics as conventionally annealed films. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) fabricated with MW-developed films (8 min) demonstrated an overall power conversion efficiency of 7.16% as compared to 7.04% for conventionally-fabricated DSSCs. This rapid and low-temperature sintering technique saves time and energy and may also pave the way for deposition of np-TiO2 films on plastic-based substrates.

It is found that the distribution of iodide ions in the MAPbBr(3-x)I(x) particles tends to be largest on the surface and becomes lower on going into the interior so that they have a correct bandgap funnel structure that is needed for transferring photogenerated charge carriers from the interior to the surface. Consequently, the MAPbBr(3-x)I(x)/Pt powder sample (250 mg) exhibits an enhanced photocatalytic activity for a H-2 evolution under visible light (100 mW cm(-2), lambda > 420 nm) with the rate of 651.2 mu mol h(-1) and a solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency of 1.05%.

Impact of Surfaces on Photoinduced Halide Segregation in Mixed-Halide Perovskites	ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							INDUCED PHASE SEGREGATION; OPEN-CIRCUIT VOLTAGE; TANDEM SOLAR-CELLS; IODIDE; FILMS; PASSIVATION; EFFICIENT; RECOMBINATION; DEFECTS; YIELDS	Photoinduced halide segregation currently limits the perovskite chemistries available for use in high-bandgap semiconductors needed for tandem solar cells. Here, we study the impact of post-deposition surface modifications on photoinduced halide segregation in methylammonium lead mixed-halide perovskites. By coating a perovskite surface with the electron-donating ligand trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO), we are able to both reduce nonradiative recombination and dramatically slow the onset of halide segregation in CH3NH3PbI2Br films. This result, coupled with the observation that the rate of halide segregation can be tuned by varying the selective contact, provides a direct link between surface modifications and photoinduced trap formation. On the basis of these observations, we discuss possible mechanisms for photoinduced halide segregation supported by drift-diffusion simulations. This work suggests that improved understanding and control of perovskite surfaces provides a pathway toward stable and high-performance wide-bandgap perovskites for the next generation of tandem solar cells.

Donor/Acceptor Charge-Transfer States at Two-Dimensional Metal Halide Perovskite and Organic Semiconductor Interfaces	ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							LIGHT-EMITTING-DIODES; SOLAR-CELLS; THIN-FILMS; DEVICES; ENERGY	Metal halide perovskite semiconductors with small exciton binding energy have been widely used in perovskite solar cells and achieved rapid progress in terms of device performance. However, the strong excitonic nature of two-dimensional (2D) perovskites with small n values remains underexploited (n represents the number of inorganic monolayer sheets sandwiched between bulky organic cation layers). In this work, we report experimental evidence of donor/acceptor charge-transfer (CT) states formed at 2D metal halide perovskite/organic semiconductor heterojunctions, with a corresponding increase in photocurrent production for these excitonic materials. Furthermore, it is found that the size of the organic cation in the 2D perovskite layer plays a critical role in the CT process. The ability to dissociate excitons in 2D perovskites by interfacing with an organic semiconductor in a donor/acceptor configuration opens up new opportunities for exploiting the excitonic nature of low-dimensional perovskites in applications such as solar cells, photodetectors, light - emitting devices, and light matter interactions.

Time-Domain ab lnitio Analysis Rationalizes the Unusual Temperature Dependence of Charge Carrier Relaxation in Lead Halide Perovskite	ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							ELECTRON-HOLE RECOMBINATION; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; IODIDE PEROVSKITES; BAND-GAP; DEFECT TOLERANCE; PYXAID PROGRAM; INITIO; ENERGY; INTERPLAY; VIBRATIONS	Increased charge carrier lifetimes at elevated temperatures constitute an intriguing and valuable feature of hybrid organic inorganic perovskites that are subject to heating in solar energy applications. We rationalize this peculiar behavior at the atomistic level using real-time time dependent density functional theory and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics. Focusing on tetragonal MAPbI(3), we demonstrate that temperature has different effects on the organic and inorganic subsystems and leads to subtle structural changes, decreasing nonradiative electron hole recombination. First, charge-phonon interactions are decreased because the libration dynamics of the organic component at higher temperature reduces the oscillation amplitude of the Pb-I lattice that supports electrons and holes. Second, thermal disorder localizes wave functions, reducing the nonadiabatic charge phonon coupling. Third, tilting of the inorganic octahedra increases the bandgap, extending charge carrier lifetime further. The detailed time-domain atomistic analysis of the uncommon dependence of charge recombination on temperature emphasizes the key role played by the organic cation, establishes important structure property relationships, provides valuable insights into efficient performance of perovskite solar cells, and highlights factors required to maintain and improve such performance.

This review seeks to provide an insight into an advanced concept on the synergistic combination of QDs and perovskites, which affords a number of exciting synergies for the further advancements in hybrid solar cells, including growth promotion of perovskite crystals, complementary light harvesting, rapid extraction of charge carriers, efficient carrier transport, surface and interface engineering, and improved stability. The emphasis is placed on the most widely studied system of PbS and CH3NH3PbI3, which enables the heteroepitaxial growth of perovskites on QDs. Issues related to fundamental physical and chemical features, lattice coherence, materials and films processing, and energy transfer between QDs and perovskites, as well as advances in device architecture and photovoltaic performance are discussed. In addition, prospects overriding current challenges are also proposed for future work toward practical realization of highly efficient and stable hybrid solar cells. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

One potential loss channel consists of electrons recombining at the interface with the hole transport layer (HTL). We synthesized adamantylammonium halides (ADAHX, X = Cl-, Br-, I-) and demonstrated that ADAHI interacts with the perovskite surface using solid-state NMR spectroscopy. As a result, ADAHI reduces non-radiative recombination when added to the HTL, raising the PSC photovoltage to an average value of 1.185 V, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) to almost 22%, and the maximum external electroluminescence quantum yield to 2.5% at an injection current that is equal to the photocurrent under solar illumination. The lowest value measured for the loss in potential is only 365 mV with respect to the band gap, surpassing the highest-efficiency silicon solar cells. Devices with ADAHI-modified HTL show excellent operational stability for 500 hours. We show the general validity of our new approach for a variety of perovskite formulations and hole conductors.

Synthesis and dielectric characterisation of triiodide perovskite methylammonium lead iodide for energy applications	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; EFFICIENT; PERFORMANCE; LENGTHS	Impedance spectroscopic measurements on spin coated 550nm thick perovskite films sandwiched between titanium oxide (TiO2) deposited on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates and with a platinum (Pt) counter electrode have been performed to determine the influence of the percentage of PbI2 in methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) compounds. These compounds with perovskite structure have been synthesized by weaving methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) and lead iodide (PbI2) in two different weight ratios of 1:4 and 3:7. The surface grains are found from the scanning electron microscoping images to have become relatively larger with increasing PbI2 content in spincoated perovskite film. Nearly 2% increase in optical band gap has been observed with increasing weight ratio of PbI2 content from 1:4 to 3:7.	[Mahapatra, S.

Impact of Moisture on Photoexcited Charge Carrier Dynamics in Methylammonium Lead Halide Perovskites	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; CH3NH3PBI3 PEROVSKITE; IODIDE PEROVSKITE; PHOTOCHEMICAL STABILITY; PHOTOVOLTAIC EFFICIENCY; INDUCED DEGRADATION; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; SINGLE-CRYSTALS; WATER-VAPOR; LOW-COST	Organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites are notoriously unstable in humid environments. While many studies have revealed the morphology and crystal structure changes that accompany exposure to humidity, little is known about changes to the photophysics that accompany the degradation process. By combining in situ steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence with Hall effect measurements, we examined the changes in the photoexcited carrier dynamics for methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)) and bromide (MAPbBr(3)) films exposed to nitrogen gas containing water vapor at 80% relative humidity. The changes in the photophysics of MAPbI(3) interacting with water follow a four-stage process, consisting of surface passivation, free electron doping, interfacial hydration, and bulk hydration. In contrast, MAPbBr(3) exhibits only features associated with the first two stages, which occur at a faster rate. Our results elucidate the degradation mechanisms of perovskite films in high humidity from the perspective of the photophysics, providing insights for how humidity affects the stability of the perovskite materials.

Although these materials are expected to have many superior properties, control of the quantum confinement and isoelectronic magnetic doping, which can greatly enhance their optical, electronic, and magnetic properties, has faced significant challenges. These obstacles have hindered full utilization of the benefits that can be obtained by using CsPbX3 nanocrystals exhibiting strong quantum confinement or coupling between exciton and magnetic dopants, which have been extensively explored in many other semiconductor quantum dots. Here, we review progress made during the past several years in tackling the issues of introducing controllable quantum confinement and doping of Mn2+ ions as the prototypical magnetic dopant in colloidal CsPbX3 nanocrystals.

Improvements to the charge transport structures in hybrid perovskite solar cells allow for much higher charge extraction from perovskite solar cells, improving overall efficiency of solar cells utilizing electrospun charge transport structures. Electrospinning and post-processing techniques were utilized to produce high surface area electron and hole transport structures for use in perovskite solar cells, and opto-electronic properties and surface/ layer interactions were studied.

For PSCs to be commercially competitive, one of the important challenges is to overcome the limitations of small area and excessive material waste from spin-coating. Electrospray printing is a scalable and roll-to-roll compatible method with high material utilization rate. Here, we report an all electrospray printing process for PSCs in ambient air below 150 degrees C. Strategies for successful electrospray printing of PSCs include formulating the precursor inks with solvents of low vapor pressures and judicial choice of droplet flight time, as well as tailoring the wetting property of the substrate to suppress coffee ring effects. Implementation of these strategies leads to pin-hole free, smooth and uniform perovskite layer, hole transport layer and electron transport layer. The power conversion efficiency of the all electrospray printed devices reaches up to 15.0%, which is the highest to date for fully printed PSCs using mainstream printing methods in air without significant material waste.

Critical concerns pertaining to the instability, hysteretic effects, reproduction, flexibility, large area and transparency, which may potentially hinder their commercialization still remain. In this work, an effective low-temperature electron beam (E-beam) approach for depositing lanthanides (Y3+, La3+, Ce3+, Nd3+, Sm3+, Gd3+, Tm3+, Yb3+, Lu3+) doped TiO2 as electron transport layer was developed for planar PSCs application. The lanthanide dopants, especially for Gd3+, could facilitate the charge transport behaviour and band gap optimization of TiO2. Additionally, small molecule DRCN5T was selected as an effective additive in antisolvent to fill grain boundary and modify the quality of the perovskite film with a grain size of 1.3-2.0 mu m. The modified PSCs exhibit a noticeably increased PCE from 19.0% to 20.53% with excellent long-term and light stability. More importantly, flexible, large area and transparent PSCs were also achieved. The flexible devices show more than 20% of their initial PCE values after 1000 bending cycles.

Increasing markets and decreasing package weight for high-specific-power photovoltaics	NATURE ENERGY			English	Article							PEROVSKITE SOLAR-CELLS; EFFICIENCY	Thin-film and emerging technologies in photovoltaics (PV) offer advantages for lightweight, flexible power over the rigid silicon panels that dominate the present market. One important advantage is high specific power (the power-to-weight ratio). Here we consider niche market size, price points and value propositions that can provide a path for new PV market entrants. Examining the cost-production experience curves of Si, CdTe and CIGS PV suggests that a minimum market size of US$0.2-1 billion is required to incubate a new market entrant. Several markets requiring high specific power meet this threshold. We assess the critical role of the substrate, packaging and interconnects and provide a quantitative assessment of pathways to maximize specific power. With all requisite components included, along with requirements for safety and reliability, we estimate a lower bound for a durable lightweight module at about 300-500 g m(-2). Pairing this bound with a 15%-efficiency thin-film or 35%-efficiency III-V module would yield specific powers up to 500 W kg(-1) or 1,167 W kg(-1), respectively.

It is observed that, with increment of the film thickness, perovskite crystallites become smaller; As for the performance parameters, opencircuit voltage (V-OC) drops slowly; while short-circuit current density (J(SC)) and fill factor (FF) rise at first, and then decrease after the film thickness surpasses about 22 mu m. The slight decrease in open-circuit voltage (V-OC) is due to heavier recombination brought by smaller crystallite size of perovskite. The upgraded short-circuit current density is due to accelerated charge-extracting rate across the interface between perovskite and mesoporous carbon, as revealed by the transient photocurrent (TPC) decay measurement. As for the improved fill factor, it is ascribed to the increased conductivity of the mesoporous carbon film. Besides, shelf-stability of the devices is tested. Stability up to 112 days (relative humidity of 40-70%, no encapsulation) are observed for these carbon based mesoporous perovskite solar cells, even though the mesoporous carbon is as thin as similar to 4 mu m. The sound stability shows that the TiO2 nanoparticle-bonding carbon film could provide effective barrier against H2O/O-2.

Despite the high throughput of these semiconductors, they are prone to long-term degradation. A degradation process that is still far from understood. This might be attributed to the complex nature of the organic compound in the A site of the perovskite structure. In this work, we disturb the perovskite structure, methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3), by inducing intrinsic defects in it using different ratios of the precursors. The presence of excess CH3NH3I (MAI) creates vacancies in the structure, resulting in higher degrees of crystallization and lower decomposition rate. The deviations from the norm in the crystalline lattice highlight the role of MAI in the degradation process. Depending on the concentration, excess MAI may also liberate halide ions. These halide ions then act as dopants and change the bandgap of the perovskite semiconductors. The dark current density in the photodetectors fabricated based on these materials increases from 10(-12) to 10(-8) Acm(-2), as the concentration of MAI in the perovskite decreases, with the exception of the base concentration. However, MAI possess a disordered molecular structure which may result in formation of trap vacancies. Therefore, the concentration of MAI in the perovskite structure must be adjusted such that formation of [PbI6(CH3NH3)(n)](m) clusters are possible.

In present work, we used the PbCl2 as a dopant to improve the perovskite film quality, we found the crystalline and grain size of perovskite film both increased with 10% molar ratio of PbCl2. The in situ time-resolved grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering measurements revealed that more pre-nucleated suspended in the solution when employed the PbCl2 dopant, leading to high crystalline for perovskite film. An incorporation of the space charge limit current, photoluminescence, time-resolved photoluminescence measurements, we uncover the function of PbCl2 in reduced trap density, decreased charge recombination and enhanced carrier lifetime. As a result, the efficiency of planar-structure perovskite solar cells based on PbCl2 enhanced to as high as 19.79% with reduced hysteresis, increased by similar to 23% compared to the device without PbCl2 (16.05%). We believe that this work would provide a fundamental prospective for mixed perovskite and promote its application in perovskite photovoltaics.

Here we demonstrate a simple and novel technique to control compensating defects in Al doped ZnO (AZO) thin films involving a post-growth annealing process with Zn blanket. We also provide an in-depth understanding of the mechanism of achieving high conductivity. As low as 8.8 Omega/sq sheet resistance (resistivity 3.1 x 10(-4) Omega cm) with 90% visible transmission value and wherefrom a figure of merit (FOM) value of 6.5 x 10(-2) Omega-1 for a RF sputtered 350 nm AZO thin film can be achieved. Such very low sheet resistance has been attributed to a decrease in the number of compensating defects and lesser out diffusion of Zn in AZO. Application of the developed AZO film as conducting substrate has successfully been tested by fabricating perovskite solar cells on flexible Coming (R) Willow (R) Glass substrate. The present findings open up the possibility of enough high quality industrial-scale production of transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) bearing crucial significance from the perspective of transparent electrodes for solar cells.

Parallel to the PSC research, there is growing interest in exploring the synthesis and physiochemical behaviors of HP nanocrystals (NCs). While these HP NCs inherently possess many unique properties that are suitable for the use in PSCs, the reported effort of incorporating HP NCs into PSCs is still highly limited. As a result, there is a gap between HP NC and PSC research. In this context, we provide here a brief review of the established HP NC synthesis and a discussion of the several recent studies pertaining to the use of HP NCs in PSCs. Based on these, we provide perspectives on promising directions for bridging the gap between HP NC and PSC research in the future.

Encapsulating perovskite solar cells to withstand damp heat and thermal cycling	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS			English	Article							DEGRADATION; FORMAMIDINIUM; STABILITY; PBI2	Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are highly promising, but they are mechanically fragile, composed of layers with mismatches in thermal expansion coefficients, and known to decompose in the presence of heat and moisture. Here we show the development of a glass-glass encapsulation methodology for PSCs that enables them to pass the industry standard IEC 61646 damp heat and thermal cycling tests. It is important to select a thermally stable perovskite composition to withstand the encapsulation process at 150 degrees C and design a cell that minimizes metal diffusion. Moreover, the package needs an edge seal to effectively prevent moisture ingress and an inert encapsulant with an appropriate elastic modulus to hold the package together while allowing for compliance during temperature fluctuations. Our work demonstrates that industrially relevant encapsulation techniques have the potential to enable the commercial viability of PSCs.

Here, we demonstrate the red and blue excitation wavelength resolved impedance response in state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells (PSCs) providing insights into charge recombination and ion accumulation. To get insight into the interfacial electronic characteristics, we fabricated PSCs with a planar architecture containing state-of-the-art triple-cation perovskite materials as absorber layers. The capacitance-frequency response under various blue and red illumination conditions were used to investigate interfacial charge accumulations and found that under high energy photons irradiation maximum charge or ion accumulations at interface (ETL/perovskite) take place. Ideality factor of PSCs was also calculated from the obtained value of high frequency resistance equaling 2.1 and 1.8 for devices measured under blue and red excitation wavelength, respectively. Our study illustrates that EIS measurements at different excitation wavelengths, reveals information about charge or ion accumulation and also provides a tool to diagnose PSCs in a more localized way.

However, the triple-cation PVSCs still suffer from initial instability under illumination. Here, we report on the improvement of device performance and operational illumination stability of PVSCs via simultaneous incorporation of lead thiocyanate (Pb(SCN)(2)) additive and Cs cations, which enhances the perovskite crystallinity and lowers the trap density. We systematically investigate the impact of Cs on the device performance of PVSCs and demonstrate stable power conversion efficiencies of up to 20%. Importantly, our PVSCs with Cs and SCN additives sustain maximum power conversion efficiencies of about 19% without noticeable degradation during continuous operation for 20000 seconds under 100 mW cm(-2) AM 1.5G illumination. The excellent illumination stability of our PVSCs is mainly attributed to the reduced defect density and suppressed photodecomposition of the perovskite due to the incorporation of nonvolatile Cs ions.

Using a perovskite precursor ink with long wet-film processing window, we demonstrate efficient perovskite solar cells based on slot-die coated perovskite layer. We found almost no difference in the photophysical and structural details of perovskite films that were deposited by spin coating to films deposited by slot-die coating. We explored various slot-die coating parameters to determine their effect on the performance of the device metrics. In addition to slot-die coating, we demonstrate the versatility of this wide wet-film processing window by fabricating perovskite solar cells with active layers deposited by spin coating, blade coating, and spray coating that all exhibited similar performance.

Tin-lead halide perovskites with improved thermal and air stability for efficient all-perovskite tandem solar cells	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS			English	Article							INDUCED DEGRADATION; FORMAMIDINIUM; LAYERS	We report the fabrication of monolithic all-perovskite tandem solar cells with a stabilized power conversion efficiency of 19.1% and demonstrate improved thermal, atmospheric, and operational stability of the tin-lead perovskite (FA(0.75)Cs(0.25)Sn(0.5)Pb(0.5)I(3)) used as the low gap absorber. To achieve a high matched current density in the two-terminal tandem, we develop a route to fabricate uniform and thick tin-lead perovskites that enable the two-terminal tandem to attain external quantum efficiencies >80% in the near infrared. By post-processing the as-deposited tin-lead perovskite films with methylammonium chloride vapor, we increase grain sizes to over a micron and boost solar cell open circuit voltage and fill factor. Tin-lead perovskite solar cells made by this method exhibit the most stable operation at maximum power under simulated sunlight of any reported small bandgap perovskite solar cell to date. We show that an unencapsulated tin-lead perovskite solar cell maintains its full performance after 150 hours at 85C in air, which is substantially better than has been observed previously. This work identifies strategies for attaining highly efficient all-perovskite tandem solar cells while maintaining thermal and operational stability.

Achieving Fully Blade-Coated Ambient-Processed Perovskite Solar Cells by Controlling the Blade-Coater Temperature	IEEE JOURNAL OF PHOTOVOLTAICS			English	Article						Ambient processing; Benard cells; blade-coating; Marangoni convection; perovskite solar cells	CH3NH3PBI3 PEROVSKITE; CARRIER LIFETIME; PINHOLE-FREE; PERFORMANCE; FILM; CRYSTALLIZATION; EFFICIENCY; CONVECTION; IMPACT; LAYER	The state-of-the-art solution-processed perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have reached the compelling power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.1%, comparable with most of the current single-junction nonconcentrated commercialized solar cells. However, the development of scalable printing and coating techniques compatible with the fabrication of PVSCs in ambient conditions still lags behind, due to the following two reasons: 1) The ambient oxygen and moisture significantly degrade the characteristics and functionality of the perovskite films, and 2) most of the research groups focus on the lab-scale spin-coating, hindering gaining knowledge and experience required to understand and employ scalable methods. In this paper, we fabricated all layers of the PVSCs, except for the back contact, by scalable blade-coating method, performed in ambient conditions, and achieved a high PCE of 11.1%, with superior device stability. Through selecting a nonhalide source and strong reducing agent, we alleviated the oxidation problem in ambient conditions. Moreover, we found an optimized blade-coater substrate temperature of 125 degrees C, which can yield micrometer-scale perovskite domain size created by thermocapillary Marangoni motion, high crystallinity, large absorption, and prolonged carrier lifetime. These results are promising for manufacturing PVSCs in high volume and in ambient conditions.

Our results indicate that the hot-carrier-induced deprotonation of MA(+) cations is the fundamental origin of the photodegradation, which inevitably leads to the release of volatile species such as ammonia (NH3), aminocarbyne fragments (CNH2), hydrogen (H-2), and iodine/hydrogen iodide (I/HI) from methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)) at different rates under simulated one sun solar illumination. Photodegradation processes can be mitigated by applying ultra-violet (UV) filters with suitable cutoff wavelengths to the light source. Additionally, we demonstrate that the incorporation of FA reduces the release of organic species but does not prevent the formation of I/HI. However, the addition of Cs effectively suppresses the release of all volatile gases. The best photostability is obtained with the FA/Cs mixed perovskites, showing that the complete removal of MA from mixed-cation perovskites is preferred for more photostable perovskites.

The surface chemistry and morphology of GO was tailored by irradiating aqueous GO solution with Co-60 gamma-ray. During the irradiation, hydroxyl radicals were believed to be released from water radiolysis and oxidized the surface of pristine GO sheets, supposedly. Furthermore, large GO agglomerates scattered as individual GO sheets with small lateral dimensions, which is advantageous to uniform distribution of GO sheets in PEDOT:PSS layer. PEDOT:PSS layer with gray irradiated GO (gamma-GO) facilitated efficient hole transport properties in perovskite solar cells. PEDOT:PSS layer became more hydrophobic by embedding gamma-GO after thermal annealing and thus improved the crystallinity of perovskite layer on top of the PEDOT:PSS. Consequently, embedding gamma-GO in PEDOT:PSS layer resulted in better electrical properties than PEDOT:PSS layer without GO or with pristine GO. As a result, power conversion efficiency was improved owing to increased charge generation/extraction, and photoluminescence in the perovskite photoactive layer. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

A two-step spin process produced a mixed halide perovskite of CH3NH3PbI3-xClx and a mixture of PbCl2 and PbI2 was deposited on CdS, followed by a sub-sequential reaction with MAI (CH3NH3I). The added PbCl2 to PbI2 in the first spin-step affected the structure, orientation, and shape of lead halides, which varied depending on the content of Cl. A small amount of Cl enhanced the surface morphology and the preferred orientation of PbI2, which led to large and uniform grains of perovskite thin films. In contrast, the high content of Cl produces a new phase PbICl in addition to PbI2, which leads to the small and highly uniform grains of perovskites. An improved surface coverage of perovskite films with the large and uniform grains maximized the performance of perovskite solar cells at 0.1 molar ratio of PbCl2 to PbI2. The depth profiling of elements in both lead halide films and mixed halide perovskite films were measured by Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy, revealing the distribution of chlorine along with the thickness, and providing the basis for the mechanism for enhanced preferred orientation of lead halide and the microstructure of perovskites.

Here, the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) with incident light exciting from the upper surface and bottom of halide perovskite films, respectively, showed very different results, verifying the much more surface trap states in the film. To eliminate the defects and enhance the photovoltaic properties of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), we designed a facile and effective method to repair the defects of the perovskite film using formamidinium iodine (FAI) solution. The dissociative FA(+) and I- ions could compensate for the loss of volatile organic cations and also fill the I- vacancies of halide perovskites. After repairing defects with proper concentration of FAI solution, the TRPL curves obtained by light exciting from the different sides of the perovskite film nearly overlap together, indicating the reduction of surface traps. As a result, both the total carrier lifetime and charge extractions were improved by removing the nonradiative channels (surface traps), which universally enhanced the power conversion efficiency and stability of the planar heterojunction structural PSCs.

In addition to acting as matrices, MSt also functions as the ligand bound to the surface of CsPbX3 NCs, thereby eliminating the potential damage of NCs commonly encountered during purification as in copious past work. Quite intriguingly, the resulting CsPbX3-MSt nanocomposites display an outstanding suite of stabilities. First, they retain high emission in the presence of water because of the insolubility of MSt in water, signifying their excellent water stability. Second, anion exchange between CsPbBr3 MSt and CsPbI3 MSt nanocomposites is greatly suppressed. This can be ascribed to the efficient coating of MSt, thus effectively isolating the contact between CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 NCs, reflecting notable compositional stability. Third, remarkably, after being impregnated by MSt, the resulting CsPbI3 MSt nanocomposites sustain the cubic phase of CsPbI3 and high emission, manifesting the strikingly improved phase stability. Finally, phase segregation of CsPbBr1.5I1.5 NCs is arrested via the MSt encapsulation (i.e., no formation of the respective CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3), thus rendering pure and stable photoluminescence (i.e., demonstration of phase segregation stability). Notably, when assembled into typical white light-emitting diode architecture, CsPbBr1.5I1.5 MSt nanocomposites exhibit appealing performance, including a high color rendering index (R-a) and a low color temperature (T-c). As such, the judicious encapsulation of perovskite NCs into organic salts represents a facile and robust strategy for creating high-quality solid-state luminophores for use in optoelectronic devices.

Influence of pi-conjugated cations and halogen substitution on the optoelectronic and excitonic properties of layered hybrid perovskites	PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS			English	Article							ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE FABRICATION; TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; WHITE-LIGHT EMISSION; SOLAR-CELLS; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; EFFECTIVE MASSES; CHARGE-CARRIERS; BINDING-ENERGY; LEAD	Low-cost chemical engineering of two-dimensional layered hybrid halide perovskite structures allows for the design of hybrid semiconductor quantum wells with tailored room-temperature excitonic optical absorption, emission, and charge carrier transport properties. Here density functional theory and the Bethe-Salpeter equation are used to predict the electronic structure and optical response of layered perovskites with two representative single-ring conjugated organic spacers, ammonium-propyl-imidazole (API) and 2-phenethylammonium (PEA). The inorganic perovskite quantum well properties are further tuned by analyzing the effect of halogen (X = I, Br, Cl) substitution. We found that visible light absorption occurs primarily within the perovskite layer and that UV light absorption induces partial electron-hole separation between layers. In addition, a strong exciton binding energy and influence on absorption spectrum is found by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation. Our results suggest that further engineering is necessary beyond the single-ring limit, by introducing more conjugated rings and/or heavier nuclei into the organic spacer. This is a promising future direction to achieve photoinduced charge separation and more generally hybrid heterostructures with attractive optoelectronic properties.

As a crucial first step to address this issue, we performed density functional theory calculations to evaluate the electronic structure of the energetically favored (110) perovskite surface in the presence of the widely reported IPb antisite defects. Our calculations indicate that the nature of trap states formed is different for the perovskite surface with exposed methylammonium (MAI) and lead iodide (PbI2) terminating groups. While, in MAI terminated surfaces, IPb antisite defects lead to shallow states close to the valence band, both deep and shallow states are created in the bandgap region in the PbI2 terminated surface. Furthermore, we determined contribution from individual atoms to the trap states and inferred that the trap states originate from the clusters of iodine atoms that are formed near the defect site. The exact nature of the defect state is strongly correlated with the atomic structure of these clusters and can be potentially tuned by controlling the processing conditions of the perovskite film.

Higher order electron-hole recombination processes can critically affect the efficiency of such devices. In the present work, the Auger recombination coefficients are computed in the prototypical halide perovskite, CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI(3)), using first-principles calculations. It is demonstrated that Auger recombination is responsible for the exceptionally high third-order recombination coefficient observed in experiment. The large Auger coefficient is attributed to a coincidental resonance between the bandgap and interband transitions to a complex of higher-lying conduction bands. Additionally, it is found that the distortions of PbI6 octahedra contribute significantly to the high Auger coefficient, offering potential avenues for materials design.

Cubic alpha-FAPbI(3) (P-m(3) over bar (m)) partially and irreversibly transformed to hexagonal delta-FAPbI(3) (P6(3)mc) at a pressure less than 0.1 GPa. Structural transitions of alpha-FAPbI(3) followed the sequence of Pm (3) over barm -> P4/mbm -> Im (3) over bar -> partial amorphous during compression to 6.59 GPa, whereas the delta-phase converted to an orthorhombic Cmc2(1) structure between 1.26 and 1.73 GPa. During decompression, FAPbI3 recovered the P63mc structure of the 6-phase as a minor component (similar to 18 wt %) from 2.41-1.40 GPa and the Pm (3) over barm structure of the alpha-phase becomes dominant (similar to 82 wt %) at 0.10 GPa but with an increased fraction of delta-FAPbI(3). The photoluminescence behaviors from both the alpha- and delta-forms were likely controlled by radiative recombination at the defect levels rather than band-edge emission during pressure cycling. FAPbI3 polymorphism is exquisitely sensitive to pressure. While modest pressures can engineer FAPbI(3)-based photovoltaic devices, irreversible delta-phase crystallization may be a limiting factor and should be taken into account.

Antisolvent processing of lead halide perovskite thin films studied by in situ X-ray diffraction	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; FABRICATION; EFFICIENCY; PHASE; CRYSTALLIZATION; COORDINATION; MECHANISM	The conversion mechanism from the precursor ink to the perovskite film using antisolvent-induced crystallization has been studied using in situ X-ray diffraction during blade coating and antisolvent deposition. We study various solvent systems forming methylammonium lead iodide perovskite. We find that it is critical to add the antisolvent before the formation of a crystalline intermediate phase. Compared to thermal crystallization, the antisolvent-induced crystallization alters the conversion route. Instead of heterogeneous nucleation and conversion through a crystalline intermediate phase, antisolvent-assisted annealing leads to a rapid direct crystallization, resulting in highly regular smooth films.

However, for light-emitting applications, photoluminescence (PL) is usually weak for MAPbBr(3) (MA = CH3NH3+) single crystals (MBSCs) compared with their polycrystalline counterpart. Therefore, developing novel techniques to process MBSCs with different morphologies for PL-related applications is greatly needed. The current strategies for making perovskite crystals are mostly based on bottom-up method (chemical synthesis and assembling). Here, an easy method to achieve top-down fabrication of MBSCs, i.e., femtosecond laser processing MBSC surface by controlling the laser parameters is demonstrated. The femtosecond laser processing technology can achieve two orders of magnitude enhancement under ambient conditions in PL. In addition, the processed regions also show three times enhancement in PL under nitrogen environment. It is assumed that this is mainly due to the texture based on photon recycling and light out-coupling mechanism, and the passivation of surface recombination centers on MBSC. This study not only provides a convenient top-down strategy to achieve a range of morphological micro-/nanostructures with enhanced PL on MBSC surface, but also paves the way for applications of MBSCs in light emitting or PL imaging devices.

J	Shen, TY; Siontas, S; Pacifici, D				Shen, Tianyi; Siontas, Stylianos; Pacifici, Domenico			Plasmon-Enhanced Thin-Film Perovskite Solar Cells	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							EFFICIENCY	We report on plasmon-enhanced hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells with methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)) as the active absorbing material. Three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain simulations were performed on perovskite solar cells that consist of perovskite films with varied thicknesses on top of corrugated gold electrodes with different light trapping geometries, such as arrays of nanoholes and nanodisks. The absorption within the perovskite and gold films was estimated by calculating the electric field at every mesh point within the simulation volume, which allowed for the calculation of the solar cell power conversion efficiency (PCE) as a function of relevant design parameters. Optimal nanostructure designs were obtained by systematically varying the geometry dimensions. The results show that 100 nm-thick perovskite films on top of corrugated gold electrodes can exhibit up to 52% increase in PCE compared to their flat counterparts (i.e., from 19.2% for a flat cell to 29.2% for an optimized nanocorrugated cell). Moreover, we show that a 150 nm-thick perovskite film cell with opportunely corrugated back metal contacts can exhibit a PCE value of_31.3%, which is comparable to that of a 400 nm-thick bulk-like-cell (31.6%). These-findings may pave the way for plasmon-enhanced high-performance perovskite solar cells with ultrathin absorbing layers.

Interfacial Charge Transfer between Excited CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals and TiO2: Charge Injection versus Photodegradation	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article							PEROVSKITE SOLAR-CELLS; CDSE QUANTUM DOTS; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; ELECTRON INJECTION; DIFFUSION LENGTHS; ANION-EXCHANGE; DEGRADATION; CH3NH3PBI3; LAYERS; FILM	Record-breaking efficiency achieved with quantum dot solar cells made of perovskite nanocrystals demands understanding of the excited-state interactions between perovskite nanocrystals and metal oxide electron transport layers. The interfacial electron transfer between excited CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals and metal oxides (TiO2, SnO2, and ZnO) was elucidated using transient absorption spectroscopy and found to occur with a rate constant in the range of 2-4 x 10(1) s(-1). In an inert atmosphere, back electron transfer helps to maintain the stability of the perovskite nanocrystals. However, the presence of oxygen introduces instability as it scavenges away transferred electrons from the electron-transporting metal oxide, leaving behind holes to accumulate at CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, which in turn induce anodic corrosion. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements have enabled us to identify PbO as the major photodegraded product. The importance of the surrounding atmosphere and the supporting metal oxide in governing the stability of perovskite nanocrystals is discussed.

In addition to facilitating. film formation, the hydrophobic PVP served to protect the perovskite grains optimization of the deposition parameters, provided for from atmospheric moisture. Use of PVP, coupled with compact, smooth, pinhole-free perovskite films that when incorporated into a photovoltaic device exhibited highly reproducible efficiencies in the range of up to 17%. In the absence of encapsulation, the devices exhibited stable performance characteristics during exposure to humid ambient air for 600 h. Furthermore, on flexible substrates, the 8 wt % PVP-perovskite samples provided for device efficiencies of ca. 15%.

Ultrasensitive Heterojunctions of Graphene and 2D Perovskites Reveal Spontaneous Iodide Loss	JOULE			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; GRAIN-BOUNDARIES; THIN-FILMS; DEGRADATION; GAS	Despite the demonstrated high efficiency of perovskite solar cells and light-emitting devices, the understanding of the intrinsic stability of perovskites is far from complete. In this work, using an ultrasensitive, exfoliated 2D perovskite single-crystal sheet/graphene heterostructure device, we reveal spontaneous iodide loss as an important degradation pathway of 2D perovskite single crystals, which n-dopes the perovskite semiconductor by generating positively charged iodide vacancies. Furthermore, we show that covering perovskites with graphene can suppress the iodide loss, significantly improving perovskite stability. A perovskite phototransistor is demonstrated with a graphene/2D perovskite/graphene structure, which shows no degradation after 75 days. Our work not only provides important insights for future stable perovskite optoelectronic device development, but also demonstrates the potential of graphene as a promising sensitive diagnostic tool for device and material degradation studies.

However, those dopants can introduce undesired charge traps that hinder charge transport through TiO2, so the improvement in the V-oc is often accompanied by an undesired photocurrent density-voltage (J-V) hysteresis problem. Herein, it is demonstrated that the use of a rapid flame doping process (40 s) to introduce cobalt dopant into TiO2 not only solves the J-V hysteresis problem but also increases the V-oc and power conversion efficiency of both mesoscopic and planar PSCs. The reasons for the simultaneous improvements are two fold. First, the flame-doped Co-TiO2 film forms Co-O-v (cobalt dopant-oxygen vacancy) pairs and hence reduces the number density of Ti3+ trap states. Second, Co doping upshifts the band structure of TiO2, facilitating efficient charge extraction. As a result, for planar PSCs, the flame doping of Co increases the efficiency from 17.1% to 18.0% while reducing the hysteresis from 16.0% to 1.7%. Similarly, for mesoscopic PSCs, the flame doping of Co increases the efficiency from 18.5% to 20.0% while reducing the hysteresis from 7.0% to 0.1%.

Engineering Stress in Perovskite Solar Cells to Improve Stability	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						degradation; flexible; reliability; strain; thermal expansion	THIN-FILM; DEGRADATION; EFFICIENCY; CRYSTALLIZATION; SCALE; EDGE	An overlooked factor affecting stability: the residual stresses in perovskite films, which are tensile and can exceed 50 MPa in magnitude, a value high enough to deform copper, is reported. These stresses provide a significant driving force for fracture. Films are shown to be more unstable under tensile stress-and conversely more stable under compressive stress-when exposed to heat or humidity. Increasing the formation temperature of perovskite films directly correlates with larger residual stresses, a result of the high thermal expansion coefficient of perovskites. Specifically, this tensile stress forms upon cooling to room temperature, as the substrate constrains the perovskite from shrinking. No evidence of stress relaxation is observed, with the purely elastic film stress attributed to the thermal expansion mismatch between the perovskite and substrate. Additionally, the authors demonstrate that using a bath conversion method to form the perovskite film at room temperature leads to low stress values that are unaffected by further annealing, indicating complete perovskite formation prior to annealing. It is concluded that reducing the film stress is a novel method for improving perovskite stability, which can be accomplished by lower formation temperatures, flexible substrates with high thermal expansion coefficients, and externally applied compressive stress after fabrication.

The current work investigates how air degradation affects the crystal size, surface morphology, and mechanical hardness of the perovskite. Interestingly, we found that the crystal sizes of perovskite, PbI2 and I-2 extracted from XRD measurements exhibited a dynamic variation with exposure to air. Particularly, it was found that the elastic modulus and hardness of the perovskite films increased for a 20 h exposure to air and then gradually decreased due to chemical decomposition and formation of pinholes in the perovskite film.

Optical modeling of wide-bandgap perovskite and perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells using complex refractive indices for arbitrary-bandgap perovskite absorbers	OPTICS EXPRESS			English	Article							HALIDE PEROVSKITE; THIN-FILMS; LIGHT; FORMAMIDINIUM; EFFICIENCY; SILICON; PHOTOLUMINESCENCE; NANOCRYSTALS; ELLIPSOMETRY; GAPS	Wide-bandgap perovskites are attractive top-cell materials for tandem photovoltaic applications. Comprehensive optical modeling is essential to minimize the optical losses of state-of-the-art perovskite/perovskite, perovskite/CIGS, and perovskite/silicon tandems. Such models require accurate optical constants of wide-bandgap perovskites. Here, we report optical constants determined with ellipsometry and spectrophotometry for two new wide-bandgap, cesium-formamidinium-based perovskites. We validate the optical constants by comparing simulated quantum efficiency and reflectance spectra with measured cell results for semi-transparent single-junction perovskite cells and find less than 0.3 mA/cm(2) error in the short-circuit current densities. Such simulations further reveal that reflection and parasitic absorption in the front ITO layer and electron contact are responsible for the biggest optical losses. We also show that the complex refractive index of methylammonium lead triiodide, the most common perovskite absorber for solar cells, can be used to generate approximate optical constants for an arbitrary wide-bandgap perovskite by translating the data along the wavelength axis. Finally, these optical constants are used to map the short-circuit current density of a textured two-terminal perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell as a function of the perovskite thickness and bandgap, providing a guide to nearly 20 mA/cm(2) matched current density with any perovskite bandgap between 1.56 and 1.68 eV.

Robert			Identifying the acceptor state in NiO hole collection layers: direct observation of exciton dissociation and interfacial hole transfer across a Fe2O3/NiO heterojunction	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							PEROVSKITE SOLAR-CELLS; NICKEL-OXIDE; TRANSIENT ABSORPTION; CHARGE SEPARATION; TRANSPORTING LAYER; SPECTROSCOPY; DYNAMICS; METAL; PHOTOCATHODES; ALPHA-FE2O3	NiO is widely utilized as a hole transport layer in solar energy devices where light absorption in a photoactive layer is followed by charge separation and hole injection into a NiO collection layer. Due to the complex electronic structure of the hybridized valence band in NiO, the chemical nature of the hole acceptor state has remained an open question, despite the fact that hole localization in this material significantly influences device efficiency. To comment on this, we present results of ultrafast charge carrier dynamics in a NiO based model heterojunction (Fe2O3/NiO) using extreme ultraviolet reflectionabsorption (XUV-RA) spectroscopy. Element specific XUV-RA spectroscopy demonstrates the formation of transient Ni3+ within 10 ps following selective photoexcitation of the underlying Fe2O3 substrate. This indicates that hole transfer in this system occurs to NiO valence band states composed of significant Ni 3d character. Additionally, we show that this hole injection process proceeds via a two-step sequential mechanism where fast, field-driven exciton dissociation occurs in Fe2O3 in 680 +/- 60 fs, followed by subsequent hole injection to NiO in 9.2 +/- 2.9 ps. These results reveal the chemical nature of the hole acceptor state in widely used NiO hole transport layers and provides a direct observation of exciton dissociation and interfacial hole transfer in this model system.

However, the understanding of intrinsic defect properties and their effects on carrier transport and Fermi level tuning is still limited. In this paper, we show that, by exploring the phase diagram of a halide double perovskite, one can control the effects of intrinsic defects on carrier trapping and Fermi- level pinning. We reveal the ideal growth conditions to grow p type Cs2AgInCl6 and Cs2AgBiCl6 as well as semi- insulating Cs2AgBiBr6 with low trap density for targeted photovoltaic or visible light/radiation detection application.

However, the development of ETL-free photovoltaics is hindered by their low performance. Herein, we reveal that a low electron-injection rate at the ETL-free interface is responsible for the performance loss. Moreover, we demonstrate that improving carrier lifetimes in the perovskite films can remedy the poor carrier extraction at interfaces, enabling carrier collection efficiency in ETL-free photovoltaics to approach that in ETL-containing devices. Using perovskite films with microsecond carrier lifetimes, we obtained ETL-free devices with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.5%, nearly eliminated hysteresis, and good stability. Such a PCE value is comparable to that (20.7%) of the analogous ETL-containing photovoltaics. These results offer opportunities for ETL-free architecture designs in the perovskite photovoltaics family. More importantly, this research provides a general approach to improving the performance of photovoltaics with low-injection-rate interfaces.

However, there still remain challenges to passivate the trap states within the perovskite film and reduce interface instability arising from penetration of moisture and the diffusion of metal electrode. In this work, perovskite passivation is reported using gradiently distributed nonfullerene electron-rich Lewis bases small molecule IDIC (a pi-conjugated Lewis base: indacenodithiophene end-capped with 1.1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone), which is realized through an antisolvent dropping process. Additionally, an inorganic wide band gap Ga2O3 is introduced as a tunneling nanolayer into interface between the metal electrode and electron transport layer that effectively passivate interface and mitigate moisture and metal ion diffusion. These treatments enable the fabrication of CH3NH3PbI3-based inverted PSCs with excellent power conversion efficiencies up to 19.86% as well as enhanced ambient stability. This work provides new strategies to improve the performance and stability for the inverted PSCs.

Phonon fingerprints of CsPb2Br5	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER			English	Article						lead halides; Raman spectroscopy; lattice dynamics	HALIDE PEROVSKITES; SINGLE-CRYSTALS; LEAD BROMIDE; SOLAR-CELLS; CSPBBR3; GROWTH	CsPb2Br5 is a stable, water-resistant, material derived from CsPbBr3 perovskite and featuring two-dimensional Pb-Br framework separated by Cs layers. Both compounds can coexist at nano-length scale, which often produces conflicting optical spectroscopy results. We present a complete set of polarized Raman spectra of non-luminescent CsPb2Br5 single crystals that reveals the symmetry and frequency of non-degenerate Raman active phonons accessible from the basal (001) plane. The experimental results are in good agreement with density functional perturbation theory simulations, which suggests that the calculated frequencies of yet unobserved double degenerate Raman and infrared phonons are also reliable. Unlike CsPbBr3, the lattice dynamics of CsPb2Br5 is stable as evidenced by the calculated phonon dispersion. The sharp Raman lines and lack of a dynamic-disorder-induced central peak in the spectra at room temperature indicate that the coupling of Cs anharmonic motion to Br atoms, known to cause the dynamic disorder in CsPbBr3, is absent in CsPb2Br5.

In Situ Measurement of Electric-Field Screening in Hysteresis-Free PTAA/FA(0.83)Cs(0.17)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)(3)/C60 Perovskite Solar Cells Gives an Ion Mobility of similar to 3 x 10(-7) cm(2)/(V s), 2 Orders of Magnitude Faster than Reported for Metal-Oxide-Contacted Perovskite Cells with Hysteresis	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							METHYLAMMONIUM LEAD IODIDE; ORGANOMETAL TRIHALIDE PEROVSKITE; TRANSPORTING MATERIALS; ANOMALOUS HYSTERESIS; LOW-TEMPERATURE; MIGRATION; DIFFUSION; CONDUCTION; EFFICIENCY; ABSORBER	We apply a series of transient measurements to operational perovskite solar cells of the architecture ITO/PTAA/FA(0.83)Cs(0.17)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)(3)/C60/BCP/Ag, and similar cells with FA(0.83)MA(0.17). The cells show no detectable JV hysteresis. Using photocurrent transients at applied bias we find a similar to 1 ms time scale for the electric field screening by mobile ions in these cells. We confirm our interpretation of the transient measurements using a drift-diffusion model. Using Coulometry during field screening relaxation at short circuit, we determine the mobile ion concentration to be similar to 1 x 10(18)/cm(3). Using a model with one mobile ion species, the concentration and the screening time require an ion mobility of similar to 3 x 10(-7) cm(2)/(V s). As far as we know, this article gives the first direct measurement of the ion mobility and concentration in a fully functional perovskite solar cell. The measured ion mobility is 2 orders of magnitude higher than the highest estimates previously determined using perovskite solar cells and perovskite thin films, and 3 orders of magnitude higher than is frequently used in modeling hysteresis effects. We provide evidence that the fast field screening is due to mobile ions, as opposed to dark injection and trapping of electronic carriers.

Steady-state microwave conductivity reveals mobility-lifetime product in methylammonium lead iodide	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							CHARGE-CARRIER MOBILITIES; METAL HALIDE PEROVSKITES; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; INORGANIC PEROVSKITES; RECOMBINATION; DIFFUSION; DYNAMICS; TRANSPORT; ELECTRON; CH3NH3PBI3	Many time-resolved techniques to study charge carrier recombination involve pulsed high-power optical excitation and photo-generated carrier densities many orders of magnitude higher than present under typical solar cell operating conditions. In this report, we demonstrate a steady-state contactless microwave conductivity technique to evaluate the photoconductivity of carriers in semiconductors at low illumination intensity, as a function of optical power density. We studied characteristics of both thin films and single crystals of a hybrid halide perovskite compound, methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)). The aggregate mobility-lifetime product of majority and minority carriers in thin films of MAPbI(3) was determined and found to be highly-dependent on incident optical power density, even at sub-1-sun illumination intensities, and attributed to trap states within the films.

We synthesized rare earth element doped CsPbCl3 NCs for NIR emission. The Yb3+ doped CsPbCl3 NCs emitted strong 986 nm NIR light; the Yb3+/Er3+ co-doped CsPbCl3 NCs emitted at 1533 nm. The total photoluminescence quantum yield (PL QY) of the CsPbCl3 NCs changed from 5.0% to 127.8% upon incorporating 2.0% Yb3+, a factor of 25.6 times enhancement. The material's stability was tested under continuous ultraviolet (365 nm) irradiation. The doped CsPbCl3 NCs exhibited a better stability than the undoped one. The PL intensity of the undoped CsPbCl3 NCs dropped to 20% of the initial value in 27 h, while the doped one took 85 h.

Furthermore, we examined the factors that affect the band gap energies of perovskites. The Goldschmidt tolerance factor and octahedral factor, which range from 0.98 to 1 and from 0.45 to 0.7, respectively, are used to filter only highly cubic perovskites that are stable at room temperature. After removing rare or radioactively unstable elements, quantum mechanical density functional theory calculations are performed on the remaining perovskites to assess whether their electronic properties such as band structure are suitable for solar cell applications. Similar calculations are performed on the Ruddlesden-Popper phase. Furthermore, machine learning was utilized to assess the significance of input parameters affecting the band gap of the perovskites.

The operating mechanism of such photovoltaic devices is under debate and the scope of incorporated organic cations (RNH3+) is limited. We report a general post-annealing method to incorporate a variety of organic cations into 2D perovskites, which demonstrate significant device efficiencies (7-12%). A detailed investigation of the archetypical (C4H9NH3)(2)MA(3)Pb(4)I(13) (n = 4) reveals that such perovskites thin films contain multiple 2D phases (i.e., 2D quantum wells, n = 2, 3, 4,...). These phases appear to be distributed with decreasing n values from the top to the bottom of the 2D perovskites thin film, enabling efficient energy transfer in the first 500 ps and possible charge transfer at longer time scale, thereby accounting for high device efficiencies. Our post-annealing method is compatible with ambient condition and only requires relatively low annealing temperature for a very short period of time, offering significant prospects for scalable manufacturing of 2D perovskites solar cells.

Photovoltaic performance of planar CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells based on CdS and high transmittance Cd(S,O) electron transport layers stacked with ZnO hole blocking layer	JOURNAL OF PHOTONICS FOR ENERGY			English	Article						perovskite; high transmittance Cd(S,O) films; electron carrier transport; native defect states	HALIDE PEROVSKITES; THIN-FILMS; LOW-TEMPERATURE; PHOTOLUMINESCENCE; TIO2; PROGRESS; SPECTRA; SULFIDE; GROWTH; OXIDE	The chemical bath deposited n-type CdS and Cd(S,O) layer were implemented as electron transport (ET) layers integrated with ZnO hole blocking (HB) layer in the fabrication of planar CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI(3)) perovskite solar cells (PSC). The bonding environment and native defect structure of CdS and Cd(S,O) ET layers were established by Raman and photoluminescence spectral analysis. Optical studies showed that Cd(S,O) has higher UV-Vis transmittance and band edge threshold relative to CdS of similar thickness. The photovoltaic performance of the solar cells evaluated with CdS and Cd(S,O) ET layers of different 40-, 55-, and 80-nm thickness shows the effect of light intensity at the MAPbI(3) photoabsorber and establishes the importance of native defects in electron extraction and transport in determining photoconversion efficiency (PCE). The effect of defect states in CdS and Cd(S,O) over corresponding J-V curves and fill factor of PSC device are described in terms of an energy band model. For 40-nm-thick Cd (S,O)/ZnO (ET/HB) layer, a PCE of 11.1% was achieved and compared with 9.18% for the CdS/ZnO (ET/HB) layer.

Achieving long-term stability under operation conditions is critical for reaching market success for PSC applications. Despite impressive progress over the past few years on fundamental understandings and technical innovations for improving PSC stability, the stability of PSCs against moisture/heat/light is still a key focus of research efforts for PSC development. Recent studies suggest that the long hydrophobic organic spacer in two-dimensional (2D) perovskites is helpful to improve perovskite stability, but 2D perovskites seem limited on obtaining high-performance solar cells due to its wide optical bandgaps and limited charge transport. To overcome this challenge, 3D/2D multidimensional perovskites-with an intermediate dimensionality between 3D and 2D-has recently emerged as a potential candidate to simultaneously maintain long-term stability and high performance. In this review, we first present a detailed discussion of the structure of 3D/2D multidimensional perovskites and their unique properties. Second, we discuss the stability of 3D/2D multidimensional perovskite and 2D perovskite as interface engineering layer-based solar cells. Finally, we summarize and outline the perspectives toward high-performance 3D/2D multidimensional perovskite-based solar cells.

Roll-to-Roll Printing of Perovskite Solar Cells	ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							X-RAY-DIFFRACTION; EFFICIENCY; PHOTOVOLTAICS; FILMS; CRYSTALLIZATION; DEPOSITION; GRAINS	High efficiency combined with transformative roll-to-roll (R2R) printability makes metal halide perovskite-based solar cells the most promising solar technology to address the terawatt challenge of the future energy demand. However, translation from lab-scale deposition solution processing techniques to large-scale R2R methods has typically led to reduced photovoltaic performance. Here, we demonstrate large-scale, highly crystalline, uniaxially oriented, smooth perovskite films printed at room temperature and in the ambient environment. Confirmed with high speed in situ X-ray diffraction measurements, the perovskite films reach 98% of relative crystallinity at room temperature and display high texture within 1 s of the coating. We demonstrate an all-blade-coated metal halide perovskite cell with power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 19.6%, a slot-die coated cell with a PCE of 17.3%, and a partially R2R slot-die coated flexible glass-based cell efficiency of 14.1%. The developed printing method can be applied to diverse perovskite compositions, enabling a variety of bandgaps to pave the way for the future R2R printing of highly efficient perovskite-perovskite tandem cells.

These materials show bright and finely tunable emission in the red and near-infrared range between 650 and 800 nm. The activation energy for the miscibility between Cs+ and FA(+) is measured (similar to 0.65 eV) and is shown to be higher than reported for X-site exchange in lead halide perovskites. We use these alloyed colloidal perovskite quantum dots to fabricate photovoltaic devices. In addition to the expanded compositional range for Cs(1-x)FA(x)PbI(3) materials, the quantum dot solar cells exhibit high open circuit voltage (V-OC) with a lower loss than the thin-film perovskite devices of similar compositions.

However, their piezoelectric properties as a possible way to modulate device performances have rarely been reported. Here, we study experimentally a photodetector based on CH3NH3PbI3(MAPbI(3)) single crystals, whose performance is effectively modulated via an emerging effect-the piezo-phototronic effect, which is to use the piezoelectric polarization charges to tune the optoelectronic processes at the interface. A piezoelectric coefficient of 10.81 pm/V of the CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal is obtained. Under 680 nm laser illumination with a power density of 3.641 mW/cm(2) and at an external bias of 2 V, compared to the case without straining, the light current of the photodetector is enhanced by similar to 120% when a 43.48 kPa compressive pressure is applied. The response speed of the photocurrent is 3 and 2 times faster than the cases without applying pressure for the light-on and light-off states, respectively. This work proves that the performance of the photodetector based on MAPbI(3) single crystals can be effectively enhanced by the piezo-phototronic effect, providing a good method for optimizing the performance of future perovskite-based optoelectronic devices.

Solution-Processed BiI3 Films with 1.1 eV Quasi-Fermi Level Splitting: The Role of Water, Temperature, and Solvent during Processing	ACS OMEGA			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; THIN-FILMS; PHOTOVOLTAICS; PEROVSKITE; EFFICIENT; MAPBI(3); IMPACT; GROWTH; BIL(3)	We present a mechanistic explanation of the BiI3 film formation process and an analysis of the critical factors in preparing high-quality solution-processed BiI3 films. We find that complexation l with Lewis bases, relative humidity, and temperature are important factors during solvent vapor annealing (SVA) of films. During SVA, water vapor and higher temperatures limit the formation of the BiI3-dimethylformamide coordination complex. SVA with an optimized water content and temperature produces films with 300-500 nm grains. Films that formed solvent coordination compounds at lower temperatures showed preferential crystal orientation after solvent removal, and we elucidate its implications for carrier transport. Addition of diinethyl sulfoxide to highly concentrated tetrahydrofuran-BiI3 inks prevents film cracking after spin-coating. We have measured a quasi-Fermi level splitting of 1.1 eV and al diffusion length of 70 nm from films processed with optimal temperature and humidity. The best device produced by optirnized SVA has a power conversion efficiency of 0.5%, I-sc of similar to 4 mA/cm(2), and V-OC of similar to 400 mV. The low photocurrent and voltage we attribute to the low diffusion length and the unfavorable band alignment between the absorber and the adjacent transport layers. The deep understanding of the relationship between morphology/crystal structure and optoelectromc properties gained from this work paves the way for future optimization of BiI3-based solar cells.

A flash annealing technique is used to produce high-quality CsPbI2Br perovskite films with high density and uniformity, as well as highly crystallized CsPbI2Br films. These CsPbI2Br films are used as the light harvesting layer in PHJ PSC devices using SnO2 as the electron transport layer and Spiro-OMeTAD as the hole transport layer. Based on the measurement of the energy levels via ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, it indicates that there is a very good interfacial band alignment between SnO2 and CsPbI2Br, supporting the efficient electron extraction from CsPbI2Br to SnO2. Thus, simple structural CsPbI2Br PHJ PSCs with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 13.09% are achieved, which is comparable to the highest reported PCEs for all inorganic PHJ PSCs. The findings show that the PHJ device architecture, instead of a mesoporous structure, can be used to fabricate highly efficient inorganic PSCs with a simple structure, offering the advantages of matching well the low-cost, high-throughout roll-to-roll printing process.

Probing buried recombination pathways in perovskite structures using 3D photoluminescence tomography	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							2-PHOTON ABSORPTION; SOLAR-CELLS; EFFICIENCY; FILMS	Perovskite solar cells and light-emission devices are yet to achieve their full potential owing in part to microscale inhomogeneities and defects that act as non-radiative loss pathways. These sites have been revealed using local photoluminescence mapping techniques but the short absorption depth of photons with energies above the bandgap means that conventional one-photon excitation primarily probes the surface recombination. Here, we use two-photon time-resolved confocal photoluminescence microscopy to explore the surface and bulk recombination properties of methylammonium lead halide perovskite structures. By acquiring 2D maps at different depths, we form 3D photoluminescence tomography images to visualise the charge carrier recombination kinetics. The technique unveils buried recombination pathways in both thin film and micro-crystal structures that aren't captured in conventional one-photon mapping experiments. Specifically, we reveal that light-induced passivation approaches are primarily surface-sensitive and that nominal single crystals still contain heterogeneous defects that impact charge-carrier recombination. Our work opens a new route to sensitively probe defects and associated non-radiative processes in perovskites, highlighting additional loss pathways in these materials that will need to be addressed through improved sample processing or passivation treatments.

Here, we used rubrene as a surface treatment agent on top of a spiro HTL. We found that rubrene can cover the pinholes of the spiro layer and provide an excellent contact layer for planar PSCs. Based on this modification, mobile gold ions from the metal electrode are prevented from diffusing through the HTL hindering the degradation of PSCs. The optimized device shows a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.87% and a 79% fill factor (FF), which are higher than the 17.98% PCE and 72% FF of the reference device. In addition, the device after modification demonstrates better stability after 100 h under continuous light illumination retaining 97% of its initial performance compared with 65% of the reference device.

Modification of the fluorinated tin oxide/electron-transporting material interface by a strong reductant and its effect on perovskite solar cell efficiency	MOLECULAR SYSTEMS DESIGN & ENGINEERING			English	Article							WORK-FUNCTION REDUCTION; ORGANIC SEMICONDUCTORS; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURES; SANDWICH COMPOUNDS; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; FILMS; STABILITY; LAYER; 19-ELECTRON; DERIVATIVES	To date, the most efficient hybrid metal halide peroskite solar cells employ TiO2 as electron-transporting material (ETM), making these devices unstable under UV light exposure. Replacing TiO2 with fullerene derivatives has been shown to result in improved electronic contact and increased device lifetime, making it of interest to assess whether similar improvements can be achieved by using other organic semiconductors as ETMs. In this work, we investigate perylene-3,4:9,10-tetracarboxylic bis(benzimidazole) as a vacuum-processable ETM, and we minimize electron-collection losses at the electron-selective contact by depositing pentamethylcyclopentadienyl cyclopentadienyl rhodium dimer, (RhCp*Cp)(2), on fluorinated tin oxide. With (RhCp*Cp)(2) as an interlayer, ohmic contacts can be formed, there is interfacial doping of the ETM, and stabilized power conversion efficiencies of up to 14.2% are obtained.

Herein, we report the judicious design of ETL composed of edge-enriched graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and TiO2 nanocrystals to enable markedly improved charge carrier conductivity and, more importantly, well-aligned energy levels at the perovskite/ETL/fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) interfaces for imparting the cascade charge transfer, thereby leading to improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs. The investigation into the influence of the GNR content within ETL on device performance demonstrated that excessive GNRs are detrimental for charge transfer as they block the contact between TiO2 and perovskite. In contrast to devices using pure TiO2 as ETL with a PCE of 15.87%, the PSCs employing GNRs-incorporated ETL display the improved photovoltaic performance with a highest PCE of 17.69%, a steady-state efficiency output of 17.05%, and a reduced current-voltage hysteresis. Subsequently, a systematic photo-carrier dynamics study revealed that the performance enhancement was a direct consequence of (a) the promoted fill factor and open circuit voltage due to the improved electron diffusion coefficient and the longer charge recombination time, (b) the increased charge collection efficiency owing to the cascade charge transfer from TiO2 to GNRs to FTO electrode, resulting in a higher external quantum efficiency and thus a larger short circuit current density and (c) the suppressed current-voltage hysteresis ascribed to the increased charge transfer noted above. Finally, a markedly improved long-term stability was manifested. As such, the rational incorporation of edge-enriched GNRs represents a feasible and robust strategy to formulate promising ETLs for high-efficiency and stable PSCs.

However, the performance of photocharging devices is usually restricted by small voltage plateau and low energy conversion efficiency. Herein, we report a novel "solar capacitor" realized by combining a CsPbBr3 based all-inorganic perovskite solar cell (PSC) and an all-inorganic silica-gel-electrolyte based supercapacitor into a single device. Benefited from the synergy of these two components, the solar capacitor can simultaneously realize the functions of solar power harvesting and electrochemical energy storage without the aid of galvanostatic charging. This device has the merits of compact structure, very fast photocharging rate and high stability, exhibiting a record voltage plateau of 1.2 V and a remarkable overall "photo-electrochemical-electricity" energy conversion efficiency of 5.1%. This work provides new insights for designing novel energy conversion-storage integrated systems.

Opportunities and challenges for tandem solar cells using metal halide perovskite semiconductors	NATURE ENERGY			English	Review							METHYLAMMONIUM LEAD IODIDE; HYBRID PEROVSKITES; THIN-FILMS; FORMAMIDINIUM; EFFICIENCY; STABILITY; SILICON; SN; HETEROJUNCTION; TEMPERATURE	Metal halide perovskite semiconductors possess excellent optoelectronic properties, allowing them to reach high solar cell performances. They have tunable bandgaps and can be rapidly and cheaply deposited from low-cost precursors, making them ideal candidate materials for tandem solar cells, either by using perovskites as the wide-bandgap top cell paired with low-bandgap silicon or copper indium diselenide bottom cells or by using both wide- and small-bandgap perovskite semiconductors to make all-perovskite tandem solar cells. This Review highlights the unique potential of perovskite tandem solar cells to reach solar-to-electricity conversion efficiencies far above those of single-junction solar cells at low costs. We discuss the recent developments in perovskite-based tandem fabrication, and detail directions for future research to take this technology beyond the proof-of-concept stage.

It is observed that, when the concentration is 0.3 mol/L, poor filling is obtained due to relatively low loading of perovskite, and the perovskite solar cells suffer from huge dispersion in efficiencies and large hysteresis index (averaged at 18.29% and up to 34.61%). With increment of the concentration (from 0.4 to 1.0 mol/L), crystallinity of perovskite crystallites is improved according to X-ray diffraction studies, and the lifetime of photo-generated charge carriers is prolonged as reflected by transient photovoltaic (TPV) detection. Meanwhile, the open circuit voltage rises up from 0.86 ( +/- 0.03) V to 0.91 ( +/- 0.01) V, and the hysteresis index is reduced from 10.02 ( +/- 4.67)% to 1.45 ( +/- 2.21)%. However, the film conductance of carbon film is decreased due to the loading of perovskite, which deteriorates the fill factor of the devices. Finally, optimized power conversion efficiency is achieved at moderate concentration or 0.6 mol/L, which is 12.59 ( +/- 0.40) %, compared to 11.81 ( +/- 0.36) % at 1.0 mol/L. Due to the barrier provided by the carbon film against H2O/O-2, all of the devices showed good shelf-stability, though loading of perovskite is varied in these devices.

The devices have an architecture of ITO glass/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite(CH3NH3PbI3)/PCBM/Rhodamine/Ag. Four batches of devices were fabricated with different concentrations of Au@SiO2 NPs ranging from 0.4 to 1.6 wt% with an interval of 0.4 wt%. The Au@SiO2 NPs were integrated at the interface between the PEDOT:PSS layer and the active perovskite layer. At an optimized concentration of 1.2 wt% Au@SiO2 NPs, the PSCs achieved 25.1% of enhancement in photocurrent from 17.45 to 22.35 mA cm(-2) and an improvement of 27.3% in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 11.44 to 14.57%. This significant improvement in device performance is attributed to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of Au@SiO2 NPs, which enhanced the light absorption in the active perovskite layer. The transient photocurrent and photovoltage measurements revealed that PSCs with Au@SiO2 NPs have a faster charge transport time and longer recombination lifetime than those without Au@SiO2 NPs. These results demonstrate that plasmonic metal nanoparticles substantially improved the efficiency of PSCs.	[Chandrasekhar, P. S.; Dubey, Ashish; Reza, Khan Mamun; Hasan, M. D.

Unfortunately, light-induced halide phase segregation has prevented their effective integration into working devices. In this study, we rationalize and quantify anion photosegregation in stoichiometric and halide-deficient MAPb(I1-xBrx)(3) thin films through kinetic Monte Carlo simulations and complementary optical measurements. Our study reveals that segregation rates are dictated by halide vacancy hopping barriers and are modulated by vacancy concentrations. The simulations further suggest that near-ubiquitous emission energies, which converge on that for MAPb(I0.8Br0.2)(3) (i.e., x approximate to 0.2) following photosegregation, arise from the existence of kinetically trapped Br- within nucleated I-rich domains. An established photosegregation excitation intensity threshold is independent of the number of vacancies and instead depends critically on parameters such as carrier diffusion length, lifetime, and bandgap tunability. The study thus sheds new light on important parameters that define halide photosegregation and presents opportunities for controlling the phenomenon.

First-Principles Analysis of Radiative Recombination in Lead-Halide Perovskites	ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							CARRIER RECOMBINATION; IODIDE; CH3NH3PBI3; SEMICONDUCTOR; DYNAMICS; FILMS	Slow radiative recombination due to a slightly indirect band gap has been proposed to explain the high efficiency of lead-halide perovskite solar cells. Here, we calculate the radiative recombination rate from first principles for the prototypical lead halide perovskite, MAPbI(3) (MA = CH3NH3). Because the structure is dynamic, with the MA molecule rotating even at room temperature, we determine the momentum mismatch between the band edges as a function of the orientation of the MA molecule. Our results demonstrate that the indirect nature of the band gap suppresses the radiative recombination rate by less than a factor of two and that the radiative recombination coefficient is as high as that in traditional direct-gap semiconductors. Our study provides a rigorous assessment of the radiative recombination mechanisms and their relation to the high efficiency of lead-halide perovskite solar cells, and will provide a sound basis for accurate modeling.

Jay			Planar Metasurfaces Enable High-Efficiency Colored Perovskite Solar Cells	ADVANCED SCIENCE			English	Article						metasurfaces; nanometer thick films; perovskite solar cells; simple planar structure	OPTICAL CAVITY; ABSORBER	The achievement of perfect light absorption in ultrathin semiconductor materials is not only a long-standing goal, but also a critical challenge for solar energy applications, and thus requires a redesigned strategy. Here, a general strategy is demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally to create a planar metasurface absorber comprising a 1D ultrathin planar semiconductor film (replacing the 2D array of subwavelength elements in classical metasurfaces), a transparent spacer, and a metallic back reflector. Guided by derived formulisms, a new type of macroscopic planar metasurface absorber is experimentally demonstrated with light near-perfectly and exclusively absorbed by the ultrathin semiconductor film. To demonstrate the power and simplicity of this strategy, a prototype of a planar metasurface solar cell is experimentally demonstrated. Furthermore, the device model predicts that a colored planar metasurface perovskite solar cell can maintain 75% of the efficiency of its black counterpart despite the use of a perovskite film that is one order of magnitude thinner. The displayed cell colors have high purities comparable to those of state-of-the-art color filters, and are insensitive to viewing angles up to 60 degrees. The general theoretical framework in conjunction with experimental demonstrations lays the foundation for designing miniaturized, planar, and multifunctional solar cells and optoelectronic devices.

Impact of Crystallographic Orientation Disorders on Electronic Heterogeneities in Metal Halide Perovskite Thin Films	NANO LETTERS			English	Article						Lead halide perovskites; heterogeneity; crystallographic orientation; trap sites	SOLAR-CELL PERFORMANCE; SINGLE-CRYSTALS; EFFICIENCY; NANOSCALE; LIFETIMES; PLANAR; RECOMBINATION; PHOTOVOLTAICS; PASSIVATION; MOBILITIES	Metal halide perovskite thin films have achieved remarkable performance in optoelectronic devices but suffer from spatial heterogeneity in their electronic properties. To achieve higher device performance and reliability needed for widespread commercial deployment, spatial heterogeneity of optoelectronic properties in the perovskite thin film needs to be understood and controlled. Clear identification of the causes underlying this heterogeneity, most importantly the spatial heterogeneity in charge trapping behavior, has remained elusive. Here, a multimodal imaging approach consisting of photoluminescence, optical transmission, and atomic force microscopy is utilized to separate electronic heterogeneity from morphology variations in perovskite thin films. By comparing the degree of heterogeneity in highly oriented and randomly oriented polycrystalline perovskite thin film samples, we reveal that disorders in the crystallographic orientation of the grains play a dominant role in determining charge trapping and electronic heterogeneity. This work also demonstrates a polycrystalline thin film with uniform charge trapping behavior by minimizing crystallographic orientation disorder. These results suggest that single crystals may not be required for perovskite thin film based optoelectronic devices to reach their full potential.

For the C-PANI modified perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the average short circuit current density increased by 13.8% compared with pristine perovskite film (i.e., from 15.9 to 18.1 mA/cm(2)) and the fill factor also improved, eventually leading to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) enhancement from 7.91% to 9.43% with high reproducibility. The C-PANI acts as a scaffold for crystallization of the perovskite layer, and improves the perovskite photovoltaic performance and stability, attributed to the favorable interfacial interaction between -NH2+-groups of C-PANI and I- of MAPbI(3) perovskite. The C-PANI-rich surfaces of MAPbI(3)/PNAI perovskite film may also assists in the hole transport to the conductive carbon in the device. This work demonstrates that C-PAM can enhance the PCE and stability of PSCs.

However, their effects on alloyed Pb-Sn perovskites are unexplored. In this work, perovskite thin films with the composition Cs-x(MA(0.17)FA(0.83))(1-x)Pb1-ySny(I0.83Br0.17)(3) are synthesized utilizing a one-step solution process plus an anti-solvent wash technique and deployed in PVSCs with an inverted architecture. All films show a cubic crystal structure, demonstrating that compositional tuning of both the tolerance factor and crystallization rate allows for dense, single phase formation. The band gaps, affected by both lattice constriction and octahedral tilting, show opposite trends in Pb-rich or Sn-rich perovskites with the increase of Cs for fixed Sn compositions. The Cs-0.05(MA(0.17)FA(0.83))(0.95)Pb0.25Sn0.75(I0.83Br0.17)(3) PVSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.05%, a record for any PVSC containing 75% Sn perovskites, and the Cs-0.10(MA(0.17)FA(0.83))(0.90)Pb0.75Sn0.25(I0.83Br0.17)(3) PVSCs reach a record PCE of 15.78%. Moreover, the triple cation and double halide alloyed Pb-Sn perovskites exhibit improved device stability under inert and ambient conditions. This study, which illustrates the impact of cation and halide tuning on alloyed Pb-Sn perovskites, can be used to further eliminate Pb and improve device performance of high Sn PVSCs and other optoelectronic devices.

We find good agreement between theory and experiment and successfully assign each of the Raman peaks to the underlying vibrational modes. In the low frequency spectral range (below 60 cm(-1)), we assign the prominent Raman signals at 26, 32, 42, and 49 cm(-1) to the Pb-I-Pb bending modes with either A(g) or B-2g symmetry and the signal at 58 cm(-1) to the librational mode of the organic cation. Owing to their significant intensity, we propose that these peaks can serve as clear markers of the vibrations of the [PbI3](-) network and of the CH3NH3+ cations in this perovskite, respectively.

Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) measurements reveal that oxygen ions are released from the TiO2 and migrate into the MAPbI(3) under a forward bias. The injection of oxygen is accompanied by significant structural transformation; a single-crystalline MAPbI(3) grain becomes amorphous with the appearance of PbI2. Withdrawal of oxygen back to the TiO2, and some restoration of the crystallinity of the MAPbI(3), is observed after the storage in dark under no bias. A subsequent application of a reverse bias further removes more oxygen ions from the MAPbI(3). Light current-voltage measurements of perovskite solar cells exhibit poorer performance after elongated forward biasing; recovery of the performance, though not complete, is achieved by subsequently applying a negative bias. The results indicate negative impacts on the device performance caused by the oxygen migration to the MAPbI(3) under a forward bias. This study identifies a new degradation mechanism intrinsic to n-i-p MAPbI(3) devices with TiO2.

In this work, the design of an HTM bearing an intensive exposure of its functional aromatic rings to perovskite layer via side-chain engineering is attempted. With an edge-on orientation and a short distance to perovskite, this HTM was expected to display an excellent ability to extract holes from and passivate defects in the perovskite layer. To demonstrate this strategy, an alternating copolymer was constructed with a 2,5-di-2-ethylhexyloxy-1,4-phenylene unit and a bithiophene unit, and the PSC based on this polymer showed an ultrahigh short-circuit current density of 25.50 mA cm(-2), which was the highest so far presented by dopant-free organic HTMs. A comparable power conversion efficiency of 19.68% (certified: 19.5%) to that of a control 2,2,7,7-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) device (19.81%) was thus obtained, which is the highest value ever reported for mesoporous PSCs based on dopant-free polymeric HTMs.	[Zhang, Luozheng; Liu, Chang; Zhang, Jie; Li, Xiangnan; Cheng, Chun; Tian, Yanqing; Xu, Baomin] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Chang] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, SUSTech Acad Adv Interdisciplinary Studies, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Jen, Alex K. -Y.] Univ Washington, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Jen, Alex K. -Y.] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Kowloon 999077, Hong Kong, Peoples R China	Xu, BM (reprint author), Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong, Peoples R China.; Jen, AKY (reprint author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Kowloon 999077, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.	ajen@u.washington.edu; xubm@sustc.edu.cn	Tian, Yanqing/N-1506-2019; Zhang, Luozheng/K-1609-2018; Xu, Baomin/B-9955-2018; Tian, Yanqing/C-1423-2013; JEN, Alex/E-5957-2012	Tian, Yanqing/0000-0002-1441-2431; Zhang, Luozheng/0000-0003-2903-1727; Xu, Baomin/0000-0002-2868-0613; Tian, Yanqing/0000-0002-1441-2431; JEN, Alex/0000-0002-9219-7749	National Key Research and Development Project - Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2016YFA0202400, 2016YFA0202404]; Peacock Team Project - Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Committee [KQTD2015033110182370]; Fundamental Research (Discipline Arrangement) Project - Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Committee [JCYJ20170412154554048]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2016M602347]	L.Z.Z. and C.L. contributed equally to this work.

It is found that by substituting the widely employed solvent dimethyl sulfoxide with DMF, the coordination chemistry of InCl3 could be altered, dramatically improving ink stability, enabling up to tenfold increased concentrations, omitting the necessity for elevated ink temperatures, and radically accelerating the deposition process. Furthermore, it is shown that by introducing compositionally graded precursor films, film porosity, compositional gradients, and the surface roughness of the absorbers are effectively reduced and device conversion efficiencies are increased up to 13.8% (13.1% certified, active area). The reduced roughness is also seen as crucial to realize monolithically interconnected CIS-perovskite tandem devices, where semitransparent MAPbI(3) devices are directly deposited on the CIS bottom cell. Confirming the feasibility of this approach, monolithic devices with near perfect voltage addition between subcells of up to 1.40 V are presented.

The emergent mixed-(Pb, Sn) perovskites with bandgaps of 1.2-1.3 eV are ideal for single-junction solar cells according to the Shockley-Queisser limit, and they have the potential to deliver higher efficiency. Nevertheless, the high chemical activity of Sn(II) in these perovskites makes it extremely challenging to control their physical properties and chemical stability, thereby leading to PSCs with relatively low PCE and stability. In this work, the authors employ the Lewis-adduct SnF(2)3FACl additive in the solution-processing of ideal-bandgap halide perovskites (IBHPs), and prepare uniform large-grain perovskite thin films containing continuously functionalized grain boundaries with the stable SnF2 phase. Such Sn(II)-rich grain-boundary networks significantly enhance the physical properties and chemical stability of the IBHP thin films. Based on this approach, PSCs with an ideal bandgap of 1.3 eV are fabricated with a promising efficiency of 15.8%, as well as enhanced stability. The concept of Lewis-adduct-mediated grain-boundary functionalization in IBHPs presented here points to a new chemical route for approaching the Shockley-Queisser limit in future stable PSCs.

For semiconductors, development of contact formation is inseparable from device performance and stability. Single-crystalline MAPbX(3) has become of great interest for perovskite devices in photodetectors, light-emitting diodes, and more recently in high-energy radiation detection. Deeper research is required to understand interfacial interactions in single-crystalline MAPbX(3). This article focuses on the dynamic impact of electrode metal (Au and Cr) on methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr(3)) single crystals. It is studied how charge transport properties of single crystal MAPbBr(3) can be tuned via electrode material selection at the metal/MAPbBr(3) interface to improve device performance with proper contact formation. The ability to create an ohmic-like or nonohmic contact by switching the electrode metal from Cr to Au, respectively, is demonstrated. It is observed that the interfacial charge transfer resistance (recombination resistance) of the Cr/MAPbBr(3) interface is 1.79 x 10(9), compared to 1.32 x 10(7) for the Au/MAPbBr(3). Cr contacts can reduce hysteretic behavior by reducing interfacial recombination and interfacial polarization. These studies provide insight to metal/MAPbX(3) interfacial interactions toward device engineering for hole transport layer-free MAPbX(3) device structures.

Despite these advances, their limited stability and need to prove upscaling remain crucial hurdles on the path to commercialization. We summarize recent advances toward commercially viable PSCs and discuss challenges that remain. We expound the development of standardized protocols to distinguish intrinsic and extrinsic degradation factors in perovskites.

A low-temperature processed oxide layer is a challenging issue for large-scale manufacture of flexible and low-cost HPSCs. Here, we propose a simple reverse micelle-water injection method for highly dispersed ligand-capped ultrafine SnO2 quantum dots (QD). Interestingly, we observed that the ligands, which help in the formation of a uniform SnO2 QD thin film, spontaneously exchange for halide through a perovskite solution, and finally we form a suitable SnO2 QD-halide junction for high-performance HPSCs. The flexible HPSC with the SnO2 QD-halide junction formed via the ligand exchange exhibits a high PCE of 17.7% using a flexible substrate. It also shows an excellent flexibility, where the initial PCE is maintained within 92% after 1000 bending cycles with a bending radius of 18 mm.

Halogen Migration in Hybrid Perovskites: The Organic Cation Matters	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article							METHYLAMMONIUM LEAD IODIDE; SOLAR-CELLS; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; ION MIGRATION; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; CRYSTALS; DIFFUSION; HYSTERESIS; SURFACE; ENERGY	In hybrid perovskite materials, the organic cations are one of the key structural components used to tune the electronic and optical properties of this promising class of materials. Here, we studied the strong impact of organic cations, methylammonium (MA) and formamidinium (FA), on halogen vacancy and interstitial migration, as well as surface degradation in cubic-phase MAPbBr(3) and FAPbBr(3) crystals using density functional theory calculations. We found Br vacancies and interstitials have much lower formation energies and higher density in MAPbBr(3) in comparison to FAPbBr(3) crystals. Moreover, the transition energy barrier for Br migration through vacancies within the bulk phase is lower in MAPbBr(3) than in FAPbBr(3). We also found that FAPbBr(3) has a much higher rotation barrier of the organic cation than MAPbBr(3), which points to a much stronger H-bonding with Br in the former case. Our results show that incorporating organic cations with the appropriate structure, shape, and strong H-bonding capabilities in hybrid perovskite crystals is very beneficial for suppressing ion migration and thus further improving the performance of hybrid perovskite-based devices.

J	Chen, ST; Nurmikko, A				Chen, Songtao; Nurmikko, Arto			Excitonic gain and laser emission from mixed-cation halide perovskite thin films	OPTICA			English	Article							DISTRIBUTED-FEEDBACK LASERS; ABSORPTION CROSS-SECTION; LEAD BROMIDE PEROVSKITE; LIGHT-EMITTING-DIODES; BINDING-ENERGY; QUANTUM DOTS; ROOM-TEMPERATURE; HYBRID PEROVSKITES; EFFECTIVE MASSES; CHARGE-CARRIERS	Organic-inorganic halide perovskites have recently developed into a potential semiconductor coherent light emitter candidate beyond their promise in solar cell applications. However, despite the ample demonstrations of perovskite lasers, experimental results on the origin of optical gain in perovskites are still elusive. Here, we analyze the excitonic gain in the green from mixed-cation halide perovskites Cs-0.17 [CH(NH2)(2)](0.83) PbBr3 (Cs-0.17 FA(0.83)PbBr(3)) by both low temperature absorption/emission spectroscopies and ultrafast pump-probe transient absorption experiments. The perovskite thin films show a robust excitonic feature up to room temperature, with estimated exciton binding energy E-b = 43.8 meV, which can be maintained under high electronic excitations that are required for lasers. By using a high-quality (Q = 1350) vertical cavity consisting of sputtered dielectric HfO2/SiO2 distributed Bragg reflectors with perovskite optical gain medium embedded inside, we have demonstrated exdtonic-gain-enabled optically pumped lasing, with improved threshold of 13.5 +/- 1.4 mu J/cm(2) and device longevity lifetime >35 h (10(8) laser shots) at ambient environment under sustained pulsed optical excitations (3.493 eV, tau(pluses) = 034 ns, 1 kHz). Understanding and exploiting excitonic gain from perovskite thin film materials may help to further boost the performance of perovskite-based lasers.

Here, a low-cost tetra-ammonium zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) was used to post-treat the MAPbI(3) (MA = CH3NH3) film. Two-dimensional (ZnPc)(0.5)MA(n-1)Pb(n)I(3n+1) was successfully constructed within the GBs of MAPbI(3) film achieving a GBs suture for passivating the defects in GBs. Time-resolved photoluminescence showed that the modification increased the decay time from 44 to 57 ns indicating the passivation of GBs reduces trap-assisted recombination. The PSCs with modified perovskite exhibited increased photovoltage, and the best efficiency was improved up to 20.3%. More importantly, the long-term stability of the responding PSCs against humidity and heating was further improved unprecedentedly. Moreover, the modified MAPbI(3) films revealed a self-repairing capability under mild heating. This work provided a novel insight into ongoing fabrication of efficient and stable PSCs by the efficient GBs suture with low-cost phthalocyanine.

Charge Recombination with Fractional Reaction Orders in Water-Splitting Dye-Sensitized Photoelectrochemical Cells	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							PEROVSKITE SOLAR-CELLS; INTERFACIAL ELECTRON-TRANSFER; INTENSITY-MODULATED PHOTOVOLTAGE; NANOCRYSTALLINE TIO2; BAND-EDGE; PHOTOCURRENT SPECTROSCOPY; TICL4 TREATMENT; DYNAMICS; KINETICS; TRANSPORT	In water-splitting dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells (WS-DSPECs), charge recombination competes with catalytic water oxidation to determine the overall efficiency of the system. The kinetics of these processes have been difficult to understand because transient absorbance (TA) experiments typically show nearly complete charge recombination on the submillisecond time scale; in contrast, electrochemical measurements such as open circuit photovoltage decay suggest a charge recombination time scale that is 2-3 orders of magnitude longer. Here we explore these processes with dye-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 and TiO2/Ta2O5 core-shell photoanodes in aqueous electrolytes using TA spectroscopy, intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS), and photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS). The fast recombination rates measured by TA result from strong laser excitation that leads to high electron occupancy in TiO2, whereas IMVS modulates the concentration of charge-separated states near solar irradiance levels. The recombination processes measured by electrochemical methods such as IMVS, PEIS, and transient photovoltage are the discharging of injected electrons in TiO2, as evidenced by the close agreement between the nearly first-order recombination rates probed by IMVS and the RC time constants derived from PEIS data. However, IMVS measurements at variable probe light intensity reveal that the reaction orders for the recombination of injected electrons with oxidized sensitizer molecules are far from unity. This kinetic analysis is relevant to understanding steady-state recombination rates in full WS-DSPECs in which molecular and nanoparticle catalysts are used to oxidize water.

Here, we present a new member of black-phase thin films of all-inorganic perovskites for high-efficiency photovoltaics, the orthorhombic gamma-CsPbI3 thin films with intrinsic thermodynamic stability and ideal electronic structure. Exempt from introducing organic ligands or incorporating mixed cations/anions into the crystal lattice, we stabilize the gamma-CsPbI3 thin films by a simple solution process in which a small amount of H2O manipulates the size-dependent phase f ormation through a proton transfer reaction. Theoretical calculations coupled with experiments show that gamma-CsPbI3 with a lower surface free energy becomes thermodynamically preferred over delta-CsPbI3 at surface areas greater than 8600 m(2)/mol and exhibits comparable optoelectronic properties to alpha-CsPbI3. Consequently, gamma-CsPbI3-based solar cells display a highly reproducible efficiency of 11.3%, among the highest records for CsPbI3 thin-film solar cells, with robust stability in ambient atmosphere for months and continuous operating conditions for hours.

Halide Perovskites for Selective Ultraviolet-Harvesting Transparent Photovoltaics	JOULE			English	Article							HYBRID SOLAR-CELLS; TRIHALIDE PEROVSKITE; NEUTRAL COLOR; BAND-GAP; SEMITRANSPARENT; EFFICIENT; CH3NH3PBI3; DEPOSITION; CONVERSION; LENGTHS	Halide perovskite materials have emerged as a potential Si replacement with excellent photovoltaic properties. There has been growing interest in applying halide perovskites to semitransparent and spatially segmented transparent photovoltaics (TPVs) to enable a greater range of deployment routes. However, the continuous-band absorption of these semiconductors prevents near-infrared selective harvesting typically targeted for TPVs with the highest efficiency and transparency needed to meet the aesthetic demands of many potential applications. In this work, we demonstrate TPVs based on perovskite semiconductors where the band gap is sensitively tuned with a range of compositions to selectively harvest only ultraviolet photons with band gaps between 410 and 440 nm. This approach offers theoretical efficiencies up to 7% with >99% visible transparency when precisely targeting band gaps around 435 nm. Practical optimization of these perovskite cells could quickly yield TPVs with power conversion efficiencies rivaling state-of-the-art near-infrared harvesting TPVs today while also providing a route to higher-efficiency multi-junction TPVs.

Consequently, there have been only a few examples of perovskite CQD solar cells incorporating relatively robust inorganic perovskite of which optoelectronic properties are not ideal for photovoltaic devices. Here, we report efficient and stable CQD solar cells based on formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI(3)) CQDs realized by rational surface regulation. Tailoring polarity of antisolvents for the post-synthetic process enabled effective removal of the insulating ligands on FAPbI(3) CQDs while preserving perovskite cores. Owing to the enhanced inter-dot electrical coupling, a power-conversion efficiency of 8.38% was demonstrated. Furthermore, the FAPbI(3) CQDs-based devices showed superior stability over those of bulk FAPbI(3) devices. Thermodynamic and crystallographic analyses revealed that enhanced contribution of the surface energy and lattice contraction contribute to their superior stability.

In this paper, we consider crystals containing orientable molecular species, which encompass the class of promising photovoltaic materials CH3NH3PbX3. Abstracting these materials as crystals of orientable rigid rotors, we develop an effective Hamiltonian that expresses the crystal potential energy in terms of collective orientations of interacting rigid rotors. The approach is motivated by the cluster expansion framework from alloy theory and is appropriate for describing both chiral and achiral molecules. This framework utilizes a quaternion parametrization of molecular orientation and makes full use of the symmetry both of the rotors and of the crystal in order to constrain the functional form of the final Hamiltonian expression. The resulting Hamiltonian is compact, systematically improvable, and is suitable for Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics simulation. We apply this formalism to CH3NH3PbI3 and report symmetry-adapted basis functions that can be used to construct order parameters or Hamiltonians that describe orientational correlation of methylammonium ions in hybrid organic-inorganic halide perovskite materials.

Different GB passivation methods are being studied, and introducing PbI2-rich phase at GBs in methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)) has been found to be useful. In this study, combining macroscale measurements with tip-based microscopic probing that includes scanning Kelvin probe microscopy for surface potential mapping and conductive atomic force microscopy for charge transport mapping, we revealed the effects of PbI2-rich phase at GBs, which was introduced in moisture-assisted synthesis of MAPbI(3) thin films. It was found that PbI2 passivation of GBs could change the surface potential and charge carrier screening and significantly retard current conduction at the GB while enhancing conduction through the grain interior. Inhibition of ion migration at GBs, as well as enhanced PSC device performance, is reported.

As the temperature lowers down, the fill factor (FF) decreases while the open circuit voltage (V-OC) increases in the case of reverse scans (scanning from positive voltages to negative ones). The decreased FF is ascribed to the increased resistance of charge transport materials (both TiO2 and Spiro-OMeTAD) as well as the increased interfacial charge transfer resistance, while the increased V-OC is due to retarded recombination which is revealed by the transient photovoltage decay measurement. Hysteresis appears in the current-voltage curves, but it shrinks with temperature decreasing and even vanishes as the temperature becomes lower than 270 K. Mott-Schottky capacitance analysis shows that ion migration exists in the device, especially for temperatures >270 K. The "S shape" current-voltage characteristic is observed at lowered temperatures, which is caused by retarded charge extraction across the interface between the active layer and charge-transport materials. Similar power conversion properties are observed when elevating the temperature from 240K to 310K; thus, the temperature-sensitive behavior is reversible. The observed behavior is compared with silicon solar cells. The study shows that lowering the temperature is harmful to the charge extraction processes of perovskite solar cells. Highly conductive charge-transport materials are needed for the devices to operate in a colder environment. Published by AIP Publishing.

Ultrafast exciton many-body interactions and hot-phonon bottleneck in colloidal cesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							SEMICONDUCTOR QUANTUM DOTS; IODIDE PEROVSKITE; DYNAMICS; CSPBX3; ABSORPTION; EMISSION; ELECTRON; LIFETIME; CARRIERS; BR	Defect-tolerant perovskite nanocrystals of the general formula Cs-Pb-X-3 (where X = Cl, Br, and I) have shown exceptional potential in fundamental physics as well as in novel optoelectronic applications as the next generation of solar cells. Although exciton many-body interactions such as biexciton Stark shift, state filling, and Auger recombination are studied extensively, other important correlated effects, such as band gap renormalization (BGR) and hot-phonon bottleneck, are not explored in these nanocrystals. Here we experimentally demonstrate the carrier density dependence of the BGR and an effective hot-phonon bottleneck in CsPb(Cl0.20Br0.80)(3) mixed-halide nanocrystals. The results are compared with two other halide compositions, namely, CsPbBr3 and CsPb(Br0.55I0.45)(3) nanocrystals with varying band gaps. The optical response of the nanocrystals changes dramatically across the spectral range of many hundreds of meV at high carrier density due to large BGR. We have calculated the BGR constant approximate to 6.0 +/- 0.3) x 10(-8) eV cm for CsPb(Cl0.20Br0.80)(3) nanocrystals that provides the amount of band gap shift as a function of carrier density. In these nanocrystals, an efficient hot-phonon bottleneck is observed at a carrier density of 3.1 x 10(17) cm(-3) that slows down the thermalization by 1 order of magnitude. Our findings reveal that the complex kinetic profile of the exciton dynamics can be analyzed by the global target analysis using the sequential model with increasing lifetimes.

Compared to devices fabricated with [6,6]-phenyl-C-61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM), the new derivatives showed similar electrochemical properties and electron mobilities. However, PSCs based on the new derivatives synthesized in this work exhibited higher power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) than PC61BM based devices, which were ascribed to their better passivation ability, likely due to specific interactions between the fullerene addend and the perovskite layer surface. Devices based on the fullerene bearing the CN group exhibited an additionally improved efficiency due to the increased dielectric constant (epsilon(r)) of this derivative. These results show that the new functionalized fullerene derivatives can act as efficient ETMs in inverted PSCs.

We use BiFeO3 (BFO) as the ferroelectric layer and Y2O3:Yb,Tm (YOT) as the upconversion layer. Different from conventional ferroelectric materials, this heterostructure exhibits switchable and stable photovoltaic effects under 980 nm illumination, whose energy is much lower than the band gap of BFO. The energy transfer mechanism in this heterostructure is therefore studied carefully. It is found that a highly efficient nonradiative energy transfer process from YOT to BFO plays a critical role in achieving the below-band-gap photon-excited photovoltaic effects in this heterostructure. Our results also indicate introducing asymmetric electrodes, both the photovoltage and photocurrent are further enhanced when the built-in field and the depolarization field are aligned. The construction of ferroelectric-luminescent heterostructure is consequently proposed as a promising route to enhance the photovoltaic effects of ferroelectric materials by extending the absorption of the solar spectrum. that by	[Mai, Haoxin; Lu, Teng; Sun, Qingbo; Wang, Genmiao; Humphrey, Mark G.; Withers, Ray L.; Liu, Yun] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Chem, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Vu, Khu] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Phys & Engn, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Chen, Hua; Kremer, Felipe] Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Adv Microscopy, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Li, Li] Australian Natl Univ, Australian Natl Fabricat Facil, Dept Elect Mat Engn, Res Sch Phys & Engn, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Li, Qian] Argonne Natl Lab, Adv Photon Source, Argonne, IL 60439 USA	Liu, Y (reprint author), Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Chem, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.; Li, Q (reprint author), Argonne Natl Lab, Adv Photon Source, Argonne, IL 60439 USA.	qianli@anl.gov; yun.liu@anu.edu.au	Withers, Ray/H-8309-2014; Liu, Yun/O-6153-2015; Humphrey, Mark/A-7483-2008	Withers, Ray/0000-0001-9017-2233; Liu, Yun/0000-0002-5404-3909; Humphrey, Mark/0000-0002-4433-6783; Kremer, Felipe/0000-0001-6263-7806; Sun, Qingbo/0000-0003-3546-0018; Mai, Haoxin/0000-0002-3493-2717; Lu, Teng/0000-0002-7866-1859; Li, Qian/0000-0001-7922-598X	Australian Research Council (ARC)Australian Research Council [DP160104780]	H.M., T.L., and Y.L. acknowledge the support of the Australian Research Council (ARC) in the form of Discovery Projects (DP160104780).

Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) have been shown as a handle to tune the work function (WF) of indium tin oxide (ITO), improving photovoltaic cell performance and device stability. In this study, we utilize a new class of boronic acid-based fluorine-terminated SAMs to modify ITO surfaces in planar perovskite solar cells. The SAM treatment demonstrates an increase of the WF of ITO, an enhancement of the short-circuit current, and a passivation of trap states at the ITO/[poly(3,4ethylenedioxylenethiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid)] interface. Device stability improves upon SAM modification, with efficiency decreasing only 20% after one month. Our work highlights a simple treatment route to achieve hysteresis-free, reproducible, stable, and highly efficient (16%) planar perovskite solar cells.

Cs2PbI2Cl2, All-Inorganic Two-Dimensional Ruddlesden-Popper Mixed Halide Perovskite with Optoelectronic Response	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL THEORY; TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; GAMMA-RAY DETECTION; WAVE BASIS-SET; RADIATION DETECTION; BAND-GAP; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; ROOM-TEMPERATURE; SOLAR-CELLS; SEMICONDUCTORS	The two-dimensional Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phases are an important class of halide perovskites with versatile optoelectronic properties. So far, only organic-inorganic hybrid RP phases involving long organic spacers were reported in this class. Here, we report an all-inorganic RP phase lead halide perovskite, Cs2PbI2Cl2 (1, I4/mmm space group; a = 5.6385(8) angstrom, c = 18.879(4) angstrom), synthesized by a solid-state method. The compound exhibits a band gap of E-g similar to 3.04 eV and photoconductivity. We find an anomalous band gap evolution in Cs2Pb1-xSnxI2Cl2 solid solutions. Our combined density functional theory and experimental study supports the thermodynamically stable nature of 1 as a unique ordered phase in the Cs2PbX4 (X = Cl, Br, I) system. The calculations suggest that 1 is a direct bandgap semiconductor with relatively small effective carrier mass along the in-plane direction, consistent with the experimentally observed in-plane UV-light photoresponse. We also demonstrate that 1 is promising for radiation detection capable of alpha-particle counting. Moreover, 1 shows markedly ambient and thermal stability.

The p-and n-type regions are typically created by chemical doping process. Here we show that in the new class of halide perovskite semiconductors, the p-n junctions can be readily induced through a localized thermal-driven phase transition. We demonstrate this p-n junction formation in a single-crystalline halide perovskite CsSnI3 nanowire (NW). This material undergoes a phase transition from a double-chain yellow (Y) phase to an orthorhombic black (B) phase. The formation energies of the cation and anion vacancies in these two phases are significantly different, which leads to n- and p- type electrical characteristics for Y and B phases, respectively. Interface formation between these two phases and directional interface propagation within a single NW are directly observed under cathodoluminescence (CL) microscopy. Current rectification is demonstrated for the p-n junction formed with this localized thermal-driven phase transition.

We demonstrate their application in the first semitransparent back-contact perovskite solar cell. A device with a V-OC of 0.88 V and a J(SC) of 5.6 mA cm(-2) produced a modest 1.7% efficiency. The use of ITO allows for illumination of the device from front and rear sides, resembling a bifacial solar cell, both of which yield comparable efficiencies. Coupled optoelectronic simulations reveal this architecture may achieve power conversion efficiencies of up to 11.5% and 13.3% when illuminated from the front and rear side, respectively, using a realistic quality of perovskite material.

Experiments report that halide perovskites containing several organic cations exhibit much longer charge carrier lifetimes than pristine CH(3)NH(3)Pbl(3) (MAPbl(3)). Using time-domain density functional theory combined with nonadiabatic (NA) molecular dynamics, we demonstrate that partial replacement of MA with formamidinium (FA) or guanidinium (GA) significantly reduces the NA electron vibrational coupling. The effect arises due to stiffening of the inorganic Pb I lattice, which exhibits strongly decreased fluctuations while maintaining its original structure and electronic band gap. In addition to extending charge carrier lifetimes, reduced lattice motions, and particularly those of iodides, are indicative of decreased ion diffusion that is responsible for formation of defects, such as iodine interstitials and vacancies, and current voltage hysteresis. The obtained excited-state lifetimes show good agreement with experiments. The mechanistic insights into the effect of organic cation mixing on charge carrier lifetimes, provided by our simulations, contributes to the fundamental understanding of the halide perovskite properties and generates important principles for design of highperformance perovskite solar cells.

Here we report an efficient quasi-2D perovskite (PEA)(2)(MA)(4)Pb5I16-based optoelectronic device processed with NH4SCN and NH4Cl additives, showing a stabilized photovoltaic power conversion efficiency as high as 14.1% (average value 12.9 0.8%), which is among the highest performing quasi-2D perovskite solar cells. These additives increase the perovskite crystallinity and induce a preferred orientation with the (0k0) planes perpendicular to the substrate, resulting in improved transport properties and hence increased short-circuit current density. Furthermore, the NH4Cl treatment enriches the Cl concentration near the PEDOT:PSS/perovskite interface, which passivates the electron traps, leading to an enhanced electroluminescence external quantum efficiency (0.68% at +2.5 V bias). As a result, high open-circuit voltages of 1.21 +/- 0.01 V with a record low nonradiative V-OC loss of only similar to 0.16 V could be achieved for the quasi-2D perovskite system.

Minimizing Current and Voltage Losses to Reach 25% Efficient Monolithic Two-Termina Perovskite-Silicon Tandem Solar Cells	ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							LIGHT-MANAGEMENT; LOW-TEMPERATURE; HETEROJUNCTION; SEGREGATION; METHYLAMMONIUM; DESIGN; ENERGY; IODIDE; LAYERS	The rapid rise in efficiency and tunable bandgap of metal-halide perovskites makes them highly attractive for use in tandems on silicon. Recently we demonstrated a perovskite-silicon monolithic two-terminal tandem with 23.6% power conversion efficiency. Here, we present work on optical optimization to improve light harvesting that includes thinning out the top transparent electrode to reduce front-surface reflection and parasitic absorption; introducing metal fingers to minimize series resistance losses; and further minimizing reflection loss with a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp with random, pyramidal texture. Additionally, to reduce voltage loss while achieving current matching, we employ poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) as a hole transport material instead of NiOx and a wider 1.68 eV bandgap perovskite composition. These optimizations boost the open-circuit voltage to 1.77 V and the short-circuit current density to 18.4 mA/cm(2), culminating in a 25% efficient perovskite-silicon tandem with a 1 cm(2) active area.

Band-Like Charge Transport in Cs2AgBiBr6 and Mixed Antimony Bismuth Cs2AgBi1-xSbxBr6 Halide Double Perovskites	ACS OMEGA			English	Article							RESOLVED MICROWAVE CONDUCTIVITY; LEAD IODIDE PEROVSKITE; CARRIER DYNAMICS; CONJUGATED POLYMERS; SOLAR-CELLS; THIN-FILMS; MOBILITIES; SEMICONDUCTORS; RECOMBINATION; LIFETIMES	Recently, halide double perovskites (HDPs), such as Cs2AgBiBr6, have been reported as promising nontoxic alternatives to lead halide perovskites. However, it remains unclear whether the charge-transport properties of these materials are as favorable as for lead-based perovskites. In this work, we study the mobilities of charges in Cs2AgBiBr6 and in mixed antimony bismuth Cs2AgBi1-xSbxBr6, in which the band gap is tunable from 2.0 to 1.6 eV. Using temperature dependent time-resolved microwave conductivity techniques, we find that the mobility is proportional to 10 (with p 1.5). Importantly, this indicates that phonon scattering is the ommant scattering mechanism etermmmg the'charge carrier mobility in these HDPs similar to the state-of-the-art lead-based perovskites. Finally, we show that wet chemicg processing of Cs2AgBi10Sb Br-6 powders is a successful route to prepare thin films of these materials, which paves the way toward photovoltaic devices based on nontoxic HDPs with tunable band gaps.

Mixed-halide perovskite nanocrystals were synthesized via a hot-injection method followed by anion exchange reactions. Our results show that increased Cl content in perovskite nanocrystals (a) diminished the photoluminescence quantum yield and gave rise to rapid radiative recombination of carriers; (b) resulted in rapid thermalization of hot carriers and low carrier temperatures, which suggests weaker hot-phonon bottleneck and Burstein-Moss effects; (c) decreased the bandgap renormalization energy, which suggests high exciton binding energy and poor charge extraction in Cl substituted perovskite nanocrystals; and (d) increased the number of carriers undergoing Auger losses, where Auger processes dominate over trap-assisted recombination. These findings provide a generalized framework to guide researchers as to when mixed-halide perovskite nanocrystals would be useful for optoelectronic technologies and when they would be detrimental to device performance.

In this work, we report ultrasensitive solution-processed perovskite photodetectors by novel perovskite materials, where lead (Pb2+) is partially substituted by cobalt (Co2+). The CH3NH3Pb0.9Co0.1I3 thin film exhibits a cubic crystal structure, optimal thin film morphology, balanced charge carrier mobilities, and suppressed defects compared to pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film with a tetragonal crystal structure, poor film morphology, and unbalanced charge carrier mobilities. As a result, perovskite photodetectors fabricated by the CH3NH3Pb0.9Co0.1I3 thin film exhibit detectivities approximatively 10(13) Jones (1 Jones = 1 cm Hz(1/2) W-1) in the spectra region from 350 to 800 nm at room temperature and over 100 dB linear dynamic range. All these results indicate that our findings of partial substitution of Pb2+ by Co2+ can tune materials' physical properties and further boost the device performance of perovskite photodetectors.

Many defects/traps in the polycrystalline perovskite absorber layer strongly affect the charge collection efficiency because the 2D-like top charge collection layer barely penetrates into the 3D grain boundaries in the perovskite layer to efficiently collect the charge carrier. Inspired by blood capillaries for efficient mass exchange, a charge-collection nano-network for efficient charge collection was incorporated into the perovskite absorber using low-cost, stable amino-functionalized graphene (G-NH2). The integration of such an unprecedented structure enables very efficient charge collection, leading to the significant enhancement of the power conversion efficiency of 1 x 1 cm(2) MAPbI(3) PSCs from 14.4 to 18.7% with higher reproducibility, smaller hysteresis and enhanced stability. The physicochemical mechanisms underlying the role of this nano charge-collection nano-network in boosting the charge collection in PSCs are elucidated comprehensively, using a combined experimental and theoretical approach, pointing to a new direction towards up-scaling of high-efficiency PSCs.

Here, a simple binary strategy for the first time is proposed to acquire ideal HOMO level by optimizing the composition of binary blend HTLs including CZ-TA (HOMO=-5.170 eV) and CZ-STA (HOMO=-5.333 eV). By adding 10 wt% CZ-STA, the binary HTM (HOMO=-5.199 eV) based perovskite solar cells achieve a maximum power conversion efficiency of 19.85% (18.32% for CZ-TA). The introducing of S atom in CZ-STA not only downshifts HOMO level but also forms stronger Pb-S interaction with perovskites than Pb-O in CZ-TA, leading to better device performance and reduced hysteresis. Importantly, the un-encapsulated PVSCs using CZ-TA: CZ-STA (90: 10, w/w) binary HTL exhibit good environment stability in ambient air, maintaining over 82% of their initial efficiency after 60 days' storage with a relative humidity around 50%. Therefore, this strategy provides new insights on HTL development to push forward the progress of the emerging PVSCs	[Yin, Xinxing; Chi, Guoli; Zhou, Baojing; Yu, Jiangsheng; Zhang, Zhuohan; Zhou, Jie; Tang, Weihua] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Minist Educ China, Key Lab Soft Chem & Funct Mat, Nanjing 210094, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Changlei; Zhao, Dewei; Shrestha, Niraj; Grice, Corey R.; Guan, Lei; Song, Zhaoning; Chen, Cong; Li, Chongwen; Chi, Guoli; Zhou, Baojing; Ellingson, Randy J.; Yan, Yanfa] Univ Toledo, Dept Phys & Astron, Toledo, OH 43606 USA; [Wang, Changlei; Zhao, Dewei; Shrestha, Niraj; Grice, Corey R.; Guan, Lei; Song, Zhaoning; Chen, Cong; Li, Chongwen; Chi, Guoli; Zhou, Baojing; Ellingson, Randy J.; Yan, Yanfa] Univ Toledo, Wright Ctr Photovolta Innovat & Commercializat, 2801 W Bancroft St, Toledo, OH 43606 USA	Zhou, J; Tang, WH (reprint author), Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Minist Educ China, Key Lab Soft Chem & Funct Mat, Nanjing 210094, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Yan, YF (reprint author), Univ Toledo, Dept Phys & Astron, Toledo, OH 43606 USA.; Yan, YF (reprint author), Univ Toledo, Wright Ctr Photovolta Innovat & Commercializat, 2801 W Bancroft St, Toledo, OH 43606 USA.	fnzhoujie@njust.edu.cn; yanfa.yan@utoledo.edu; whtang@njust.edu.cn	TANG, WEIHUA/B-8713-2008; Zhao, Dewei/F-5928-2010; Song, Zhaoning/J-2905-2017; Yu, Jiangsheng/X-9140-2019	TANG, WEIHUA/0000-0002-6233-3471; Zhao, Dewei/0000-0001-7914-6288; Song, Zhaoning/0000-0002-6677-0994; 	National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [51573077]; Jiangsu Province Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars [BK20130032]; Program for New Century Excellent Talents in UniversityProgram for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET) [NCET-12-0633]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) SunShot Initiative under the Next Generation Photovoltaics 3 program [DE-FOA-0000990]; Office of Naval ResearchOffice of Naval Research [N00014-17-1-2223]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CHE-1230246, DMR-1534686, ECCS1665028]; Air Force Research Laboratory under Space Vehicles Directorate [FA9453-11-C-0253]; Ohio Research Scholar Program; China Scholarship Council (CSC)China Scholarship Council [201706840039]	The design and development of CZ-STA was completed by Tang's group at Nanjing University of Science and Technology under the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51573077), the Jiangsu Province Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars (BK20130032), the Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET-12-0633), and the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions.

Here, a facile hydrothermal method is demonstrated for the growth of highly crystalline and uniform 1D SnO2 nanorod arrays (SR) with excellent optical property, which are further successfully exploited as ETMs in PSCs. Both length and diameter of 1D SR are tuned carefully by optimizing the hydrothermal process. Power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 16.7% can be obtained for PSCs based on these SR. Furthermore, a graded heterojunction (GHJ) configuration was built by intercalating a TiO2 thin interlayer to improve the band alignment between perovskite and SR, which pushes the PCE to 18.7% with better ambient stability. This work demonstrates that the SR can act as a promising candidate for ETM in PSCs, and provides a workable stategy to improve the performance of PSCs.

J	Hajjiah, A; Kandas, I; Shehata, N				Hajjiah, Ali; Kandas, Ishac; Shehata, Nader			Efficiency Enhancement of Perovskite Solar Cells with Plasmonic Nanoparticles: A Simulation Study	MATERIALS			English	Article						Perovskites; solar cell; plasmonic nanoparticles; short circuit current; quantum efficiency	HALIDE PEROVSKITES; OPTICAL-ABSORPTION; GOLD; SINGLE; PARTICLES; SILICON	Recently, hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites have been extensively studied due to their promising optical properties with relatively low-cost and simple processing. However, the perovskite solar cells have some low optical absorption in the visible spectrum, especially around the red region. In this paper, an improvement of perovskite solar cell efficiency is studied via simulations through adding plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) at the rear side of the solar cell. The plasmonic resonance wavelength is selected to be very close to the spectrum range of lower absorption of the perovskite: around 600 nm. Both gold and silver nanoparticles (Au and Ag NPs) are selected to introduce the plasmonic effect with diameters above 40 nm, to get an overlap between the plasmonic resonance spectrum and the requested lower absorption spectrum of the perovskite layer. Simulations show the increase in the short circuit current density (J(sc)) as a result of adding Au and Ag NPs, respectively. Enhancement in J(sc) is observed as the diameter of both Au and Ag NPs is increased beyond 40 nm. Furthermore, there is a slight increase in the reflection loss as the thickness of the plasmonic nanoparticles at the rear side of the solar cell is increased. A significant decrease in the current loss due to transmission is achieved as the size of the nanoparticles increases. As a comparison, slightly higher enhancement in external quantum efficiency (EQE) can be achieved in case of adding Ag NPs rather than Au NPs.

Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) could open up new applications by enabling lightweight and flexible PV modules. However, the cost of synthesizing nanocrystals at the large scale needed for PV module production has not previously been investigated. Based on our experience with commercial QD scale-up, we develop a Monte Carlo model to analyze the cost of synthesizing lead sulfide and metal halide perovskite QDs using 8 different reported synthetic methods. We also analyze the cost of solution-phase ligand exchange for preparing deposition-ready PbS QD inks, as well as the manufacturing cost for roll-to-roll solution-processed PV modules using these materials. We find that present QD synthesis costs are prohibitively high for PV applications, with median costs of 11 to 59 $ per g for PbS QDs (0.15 to 0.84 $ per W for a 20% efficient cell) and 73 $ per g for CsPbI3 QDs (0.74 $ per W). QD ink preparation adds 6.3 $ per g (0.09 $ per W). In total, QD materials contribute up to 55% of the total module cost, making even roll-to-roll-processed QDPV modules significantly more expensive than silicon PV modules. These results suggest that the development of new low-cost synthetic methods is critically important for the commercial relevance of QD photovoltaics. Using our cost model, we identify strategies for reducing synthetic cost and propose a cost target of 5 $ per g to move QD solar cells closer to commercial viability.

Stability in Perovskite Photovoltaics: A Paradigm for Newfangled Technologies	ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; EFFICIENT; PASSIVATION	While halide perovskites embody some of the most ideal photovoltaic properties, the breakthrough into the commercial marketplace is still uncertain and high risk. The major technical hurdle that still must be overcome is durability. This Perspective lays out our view of the ultimate needs for perovskite solar cell stability research to flourish. We outline a paradigm for conceptualizing stability as a tiered system of material, cell, and module. In cell-level studies, in particular, we propose the adoption of transferrable and flexible testing protocols. We believe that the adoption of standard testing protocols could dramatically improve the translatability of insights between laboratories working in this area worldwide; however, improved protocols alone will by no means replace the need for mechanistic insight into degradation mechanisms at all levels of perovskite solar cell stability. We believe that knowledge of degradation science is what will ultimately push perovskite solar cell modules from promise to production.

For this purpose, we have developed the nonadiabatic molecular dynamics method with two component spinor wave functions that are solutions of the relativistic Kohn-Sham (KS) equations. We find that SOC enhances contributions of Pb(p(x)) and Pb(p(y)) orbitals to the conduction and valence bands. As a result, the KS orbitals become more sensitive to nuclear motions, leading to the increased nonadiabatic couplings. Consequently, SOC greatly speeds up the electron and hole relaxation, making the computed relaxation time scales consistent with available experiments. We suggest that the fast hot carrier relaxation facilitated by the SOC allows rapid transition into the long-lived triplet state that extends charge-carrier lifetime and helps achieve high-efficiency perovskite solar cells.

Consequence of Iodide Treatment on Phase Segregation Recovery	ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							HYBRID PEROVSKITES; LEAD PEROVSKITES; NANOCRYSTALS; FILMS; PERFORMANCE; STABILITY; EXCHANGE; BROMIDE	Photoinduced halide ion segregation in mixed halide perovskites can introduce a detrimental effect on the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells over extended light exposure. The photoconversion efficiency decreases from 5.5 to 2.3% when methylammonium lead mixed halide perovskite (MAPbBr(1.5)I(1.5)) solar cells are exposed to 25 min of continuous illumination with visible light. The formation of iodide-rich and bromide rich-regions creates traps, which serve as bottlenecks to the flow of charge carriers. Iodide treatment overcomes some of these effects and stabilizes the solar cell performance. It also facilitates quicker recovery in the dark. The decrease in open-circuit voltage following the exposure of visible light was minimal in iodide-treated solar cells. Transient absorption measurements provide insight into the influence of light exposure on charge carrier recombination processes in mixed halide perovskite films. The iodide treatment strategy presented here can aid in designing stable mixed halide perovskite solar cells and the development of multijunction solar cells.	[Balakrishna, R.

Room Temperature Processing of Inorganic Perovskite Films to Enable Flexible Solar Cells	ISCIENCE			English	Article							HOLE-CONDUCTOR-FREE; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; IMPROVED STABILITY; EFFICIENCY; PHASE; PERFORMANCE; CRYSTALLIZATION; LAYERS; LIGHT; ALPHA-CSPBI3	Inorganic lead halide perovskite materials have attracted great attention recently due to their potential for greater thermal stability compared with hybrid organic perovskites. However, the high processing temperature to convert from the non-perovskite phase to the cubic perovskite phase in many of these systems has limited their application in flexible optoelectronic devices. Here, we report a room temperature processed inorganic perovskite solar cell (PSC) based on CsPbI2Br as the light harvesting layer- By combining this composition with key precursor solvents, we show that inorganic perovskite films can be prepared by the vacuum-assist method under room temperature conditions in air. Unencapsulated devices achieved power conversion efficiency up to 8.67% when measured under 1-sun irradiation. Exploiting this room temperature process, flexible inorganic PSCs based on an inorganic metal halide perovskite material are demonstrated.

In tandem solar device architectures, the interconnecting layer plays a critical role in determining the overall cell performance, requiring both an effective electrical connection and high optical transparency. We used nanoscale interface engineering of the CIGS surface and a heavily doped poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl) amine] (PTAA) hole transport layer between the subcells that preserves open-circuit voltage and enhances both the fill factor and short-circuit current. A monolithic perovskite/CIGS tandem solar cell achieved a 22.43% efficiency, and unencapsulated devices under ambient conditions maintained 88% of their initial efficiency after 500 hours of aging under continuous 1-sun illumination.

For a given composition, the photoluminescence (PL) of these mixed halide perovskites is compared to that of bulk perovskite microwires/microcubes. Interestingly, for CH3NH3PbI2.23Br0.75 formed within these NTs, precise control of the cubic phase of this perovskite is maintained over time, as monitored by X-ray diffraction up to 21 days; this behavior is in stark contrast to the microwire, nontemplated structure of the same composition, which reverts to the tetragonal phase during this period. For the 70 and 200 nm ID templates, these NTs also provide some stabilization and effective packaging of the perovskite with regard to crystallinity and PL intensity over this time period.

Despite high power-conversion efficiencies, the stability of these devices, particularly when exposed to humidity and oxygen, remains poor. In the current study, a pathway to increase the stability of methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) based solar cells towards humidity is demonstrated, while maintaining the simplicity and solution-processability of the active layers. Thermal annealing of the precursor solution prior to deposition induces the formation of cubic-phase perovskite films in the solid state at room temperature. The experiments demonstrate that this improved ambient stability is correlated with the presence of the cubic phase at device operating temperatures, with the cubic phase resisting the formation of perovskite monohydrate-a pathway of degradation in conventionally processed perovskite thin films-on exposure to humidity.

Here, a novel dimethyl sulfide (DS) additive is developed to effectively improve the performance of the F-PSCs. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy reveals that the DS additive reacts with Pb2+ to form a chelated intermediate, which significantly slows down the crystallization rate, leading to large grain size and good crystallinity for the resultant perovskite film. In fact, the trap density of the perovskite film prepared using the DS additive is reduced by an order of magnitude compared to the one without it, demonstrating that the additive effectively retards transformation kinetics during the thin film formation process. As a result, the PCE of the flexible devices increases to 18.40%, with good mechanical tolerance, the highest reported so far for the F-PSCs. Meanwhile, the environmental stability of the F-PSCs significantly enhances by 1.72 times compared to the device without the additive, likely due to the large grain size that suppresses perovskite degradation at grain boundaries. The present strategy will help guide development of high efficiency F-PSCs for practical applications.

Time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) is one of the few techniques that can obtain chemical information from all components of halide organic-inorganic perovskite photovoltaics in one dimension (standard depth profiling), two-dimensions (high-resolution 100 nm imaging), as well as three-dimensions (tomography combining high-resolution imaging with depth profiling). TOF-SIMS has been used to analyze perovskite photovoltaics made by a variety of methods, and the breadth of insight that can be gained from this technique is illustrated here including: cation uniformity (depth and lateral), changes in chemistry upon alternate processing, changes in chemistry upon degradation (including at interfaces), and lateral distribution of passivating additives. Using TOF-SIMS on multiple perovskite compositions, we show that the information regarding halide perovskite formation as well as inhomogeneity critical to device performance can be extracted providing one of the best proxies for understanding compositional changes resulting from degradation. We also describe in detail the measurement artifacts and recommend the best practices that enable unique insight regarding halide perovskite solar cell materials and devices.

The nucleation of an ALD oxide on PCBM is critical to reliably apply this strategy. In this paper, we present the first study of the nucleation behavior of ALD oxides, including Al2O3 and ZnO, on PCBM. We find that PCBM film acts a gas diffusion barrier blocking the ALD reactants (diethyl zinc) from etching the underlying CH3NH3PbI3. However, ZnO is not able to nucleate on PCBM. We further identify that trimethyl aluminum, a strongly Lewis acid, reacts readily with C=O on PCBM to generate a seeding layer for nucleating ZnO ALD. This new chemical route is highly reliable and can be used to synthesize ALD ZnO coatings over PCBM. The synthesized PCBM/Al2O3-ZnO dramatically improves the stability of CH3NH3PbI3 against the ambience and even against liquid water. The result signifies the importance of understanding of nucleation of ALD in enabling reliable barrier coatings for hybrid halide perovskites.

J	Kurchin, RC; Gorai, P; Buonassisi, T; Stevanovic, V				Kurchin, Rachel C.; Gorai, Prashun; Buonassisi, Tonio; Stevanovic, Vladan			Structural and Chemical Features Giving Rise to Defect Tolerance of Binary Semiconductors	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							PEROVSKITE SOLAR-CELLS; P-TYPE OXIDE; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; LEAD-FREE; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; EFFICIENT; IODIDE; DESIGN; PRINCIPLES; MANAGEMENT	Defect tolerance, or the resilience of electronic transport properties of a crystalline material to the presence of defects, has emerged as a critical factor in the success of hybrid lead halide perovskites as photovoltaic absorbers. A key aspect of defect tolerance is the shallow character of dominant intrinsic defects. However, while qualitative heuristics to identify other defect-tolerant materials have been proposed, in particular, the presence of a partially oxidized ns(2) cation such as Pb, no compelling comprehensive understanding of how these shallow defects arise has yet emerged. Using modern defect theory and defect calculations, we conduct a detailed investigation of the mechanisms and identify specific features related to the chemical composition and crystal structure that give rise to defect tolerance. We find that an ns(2) cation is necessary but not sufficient to guarantee shallow cation vacancies in an s-p system, and that a compound's crystal structure can ensure shallow anion vacancies in a variety of ways. Specifically, the crystal site symmetry can enforce weak interactions between the orbitals that form the defect states, thus ensuring that those defect states are shallow. We substantiate our findings by computing defect formation energies in several known as well as hypothetical materials and conclude by discussing prospects for identifying semiconductors that satisfy these criteria.

However, their potential for low cost and facile fabrication process needs to overcome harriers related to environmental stability and compatibility. Herein, using first-principles calculations, we studied the structural and electronic properties of air molecules (H2O, O-2, N-2, and CO2) in MAPbI(3) and FAPbI(3). Both formation energy and electronic band structures show large differences for H2O and O-2 in these perovskites, In addition, the stability of inorganic perovskite, CsPbI3, was investigated and compared with the aforementioned organic ones. Based on the degradation mechanisms revealed by crosswise comparative analysis here, possible routes can be developed to stabilize the hybrid perovskite solar cells and thus accelerate their commercial applications.

Almost no PVSCs have exhibited PCEs above 18% with a 1 micrometer planar layer before, owing to the excess perovskite defects deteriorating charge extraction and the performance of thick-film based devices. Benefiting from the nearly identical optoelectronic properties of two ETMs stemming from tailored chemical structures, the studies on them allow us to unveil the fact that subtle molecular interaction (anion- and Lewis acid-base) between ETMs and perovskites strongly affects the charge extraction at the heterointerface, which in turn influences the device hysteresis and performance. Particularly, weak Lewis base-acid O-Pb2+ interaction between MCM and the perovskite helps passivate the trap-states at the interface, resulting in a smooth electron extraction and reduced device hysteresis (the average hysteresis index (HI) of 0.03 +/- 0.01). However, the strong N-Pb2+ coordination induces misalignment of the energy levels at the perovskite/PCP heterojunction, causing electron accumulation at the junction, and hence the large HI (0.17 +/- 0.05) in devices. This work provides new insights into the charge extraction at the perovskite/organic interface and the possible molecular interaction from organics to cure perovskite defects.

Transformation from crystalline precursor to perovskite in PbCl2-derived MAPbI(3)	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							HYBRID SOLAR-CELLS; HALIDE PEROVSKITE; TRIHALIDE PEROVSKITE; LEAD IODIDE; PERFORMANCE; FILM; MORPHOLOGY; EFFICIENCY; KINETICS; CHLORIDE	Understanding the formation chemistry of metal halide perovskites is key to optimizing processing conditions and realizing enhanced optoelectronic properties. Here, we reveal the structure of the crystalline precursor in the formation of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)) from the single-step deposition of lead chloride and three equivalents of methylammonium iodide (PbCl2 + 3MAI) (MA = CH3NH3). The as-spun film consists of crystalline MA(2)PbI(3)Cl, which is composed of one-dimensional chains of lead halide octahedra, coexisting with disordered MACl. We show that the transformation of precursor into perovskite is not favored in the presence of MACl, and thus the gradual evaporation of MACl acts as a self-regulating mechanism to slow the conversion. We propose the stable precursor phase enables dense film coverage and the slow transformation may lead to improved crystal quality. This enhanced chemical understanding is paramount for the rational control of film deposition and the fabrication of superior optoelectronic devices.

Herein, the enhanced chemical stability of CH3NH3PbI3 is reported by doping the divalent anion Se2- in the form of PbSe in precursor solutions to enhance the hydrogen-bonding-like interactions between the organic cations and the inorganic framework. As a result, in 100% humidity at 40 degrees C, the 10% w/w PbSe-doped CH3NH3PbI3 films exhibited >140-fold stability improvement over pristine CH3NH3PbI3 films. As the PbSe-doped CH3NH3PbI3 films maintained the perovskite structure, a top efficiency of 10.4% with 70% retention after 700 h aging in ambient air is achieved with an unencapsulated 10% w/w PbSe:MAPbI(3)-based cell. As a bonus, the incorporated Se2- also effectively suppresses iodine diffusion, leading to enhanced chemical stability of the silver electrodes.

Atomic Layer Deposited TiO2-IrOx Alloy as a Hole Transport Material for Perovskite Solar Cells	ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES			English	Article						atomic layer deposition; alloy; hole transport materials; perovskite solar cells	ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; LOW-TEMPERATURE; IODIDE; CH3NH3PBI3; CONDUCTOR; EFFICIENT; IRIDIUM; LENGTHS; LIGHT	The hole transport layer (HTL) is one of the key components in planar perovskite solar cells. This study reports a new kind of HTL fabricated using atomic layer deposition (ALD). By alloying TiO2 with IrOx, it is demonstrated that TiO2, a well-known electron-selective contact and electron transport layer in photovoltaic devices, can behave as an HTL with an appropriately high work function. Perovskite Cs(0.17)FA(0.83)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)(3) solar cells including this new hole transport material achieve a power conversion efficiency of 15.8% under AM1.5G simulated solar irradiation compared to a 14.3% efficiency for otherwise-identical devices incorporating a more standard NiO HTL layer. These results suggest the promise of transition metal oxide alloys synthesized by ALD as hole contact materials for optoelectronic devices, including advanced photovoltaics.

Targeted Ligand-Exchange Chemistry on Cesium Lead Halide Perovskite Quantum Dots for High-Efficiency Photovoltaics	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; NANOCRYSTALS; SURFACE; BINDING; FORMAMIDINIUM; SPECTROSCOPY; CARBOXYLATE; EMISSION; FILMS	The ability to manipulate quantum dot (QD) surfaces is foundational to their technological deployment. Surface manipulation of metal halide perovskite (MHP) QDs has proven particularly challenging in comparison to that of more established inorganic materials due to dynamic surface species and low material formation energy; most conventional methods of chemical manipulation targeted at the MHP QD surface will result in transformation or dissolution of the MHP crystal. In previous work, we have demonstrated record-efficiency QD solar cells (QDSCs) based on ligand-exchange procedures that electronically couple MHP QDs yet maintain their nanocrystalline size, which stabilizes the corner-sharing structure of the constituent PbI64- octahedra with optoelectronic properties optimal for solar energy conversion. In this work, we employ a variety of spectroscopic techniques to develop a molecular-level understanding of the MHP QD surface chemistry in this system. We individually target both the anionic (oleate) and cationic (oleylammonium) ligands. We find that atmospheric moisture aids the process by hydrolysis of methyl acetate to generate acetic acid and methanol. Acetic acid then replaces native oleate ligands to yield QD surface-bound acetate and free oleic acid. The native oleylammonium ligands remain throughout this film deposition process and are exchanged during a final treatment step employing smaller cations-namely, formamidinium. This final treatment has a narrow processing window; initial treatment at this stage leads to a more strongly coupled QD regime followed by transformation into a bulk MHP film after longer treatment. These insights provide chemical understanding to the deposition of high-quality, electronically coupled MHP QD films that maintain both quantum confinement and their crystalline phase and attain high photovoltaic performance.

Particularly, the emerging two-dimensional (2D) forms of halide perovskites are attracting more interest due to the long charge carrier lifetime, high photoluminescence quantum efficiency, and great defect tolerance. Interfacing 2D halide perovskites with other 2D materials including graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) significantly broadens the application range of the 2D materials and enhances the performance of the functional devices. The synthesis and characterization of 2D halide perovskite nanostructures, the interface of the 2D halide perovskites with other 2D materials, and the integration of them into high-performance optoelectronic devices including solar cells, photodetectors, transistors, and memory devices are currently under investigation. In this article, we review the progress of the above-mentioned topics in a timely manner and discuss the current challenges and future promising directions in this field.

In this work, we explored antisolvent-free additive engineering to fabricate compact CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI(3)) perovskite films combining the coordination effect of methylammonium chloride (MACl) and methylammonium acetate (MAAc). The MACl coordination with organic and metal halides in the precursor solution resulted in the perovskite film having a large grain size and a single crystal-like cross-section profile (monolayer-like). The introduction of MAAc into the precursor solution reduced the perovskite film shrinkage after the film deposition, presumably due to an increased nucleation rate. Consequently, we succeeded in fabricating high-quality monolayer-like perovskite films with a micro-scale grain size (approximate to 2 m), a smooth surface and enhanced crystallinity. The time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectra and space-charge limited current (SCLC) measurements have confirmed that there was a significantly reduced density of trap states, which has an imminent impact on the perovskite film quality. As a result, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) using the mixed additive increases to 19.64%, which is much larger than those of devices using a single MACl additive (15.61%). Accordingly, this work provides a new one-step fabrication method of high-quality perovskite films for the coming generation of PSCs.

It requires feasible approaches that further deepen the fundamental understanding of device physics in specific device architecture in order to solve this problem eventually. Here, perovskite solar cells configured with different counter electrodes are systematically investigated with the focus on charge accumulation within the devices responsible for J-V hysteresis. The results indicate that J-V hysteresis is affected by charge accumulation which can be modulated by carrier extraction efficiency of the electrodes. Through a rationally induced interfacial dipole, the devices have shown improvement in carrier extraction, which thus reduces J-V hysteresis significantly. It provides solid evidence for the proposition that interface charge plays an important role in J-V hysteresis, and demonstrates an applicable strategy that effectively alleviates J-V hysteresis in perovskite solar cells.

Interfacial Effects of Tin Oxide Atomic Layer Deposition in Metal Halide Perovskite Photovoltaics	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						atomic layer deposition; perovskite; solar; tin oxide	SOLAR-CELLS; EFFICIENCY; TEMPERATURE; SURFACE; TETRAKIS(DIMETHYLAMIDO)TITANIUM; MANAGEMENT; STABILITY; TRIHALIDE; FILMS	Metal halide perovskites offer a wide and tunable bandgap, making them promising candidates for top-cell absorbers in tandem photovoltaics. In this work, the authors aim to understand the atomic layer deposition (ALD) precursor-perovskite interactions of the tin oxide ALD system and the role of organic fullerenes at the perovskite-tin oxide interface while establishing a framework for developing alternative perovskite-compatible ALD processes in the future. It is shown, in the case of tin oxide ALD growth with tetrakis(dimethylamino)tin(IV) and water on FA(0.83)Cs(0.17)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)(3) perovskite, that perovskite stability is most sensitive to metal-organic exposure at elevated temperatures with an onset near 110 degrees C, resulting in removal of the formamidinium cation. Transitioning from ALD to pulsed-chemical vapor deposition tin oxide growth can minimize the degradation effects. Investigation of fullerenes at the perovskite interface shows that thin fullerene layers offer minor improvements to perovskite stability under ALD conditions, but significant enhancement in carrier extraction. Fullerene materials are undesirable due to fabrication cost and poor mechanical stability. Compositional tuning of the perovskite material can improve the fullerene-free device performance. This method is demonstrated with a bromine-rich perovskite phase to enable an 8.2% efficient perovskite device with all-inorganic extraction layers.

Here, an amorphous layer of SnO2 (a-SnO2) between the TiO2 ETL and the perovskite absorber is inserted and the charge transport properties of the device are studied. The double-layer structure of TiO2 compact layer (c-TiO2) and a-SnO2 ETL leads to modification of interface energetics, resulting in improved charge collection and decreased carrier recombination in PSCs. The optimized device based on a-SnO2/c-TiO2 ETL shows a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.4% as compared to 19.33% for c-TiO2 based device. Moreover, the modified device demonstrates a maximum open-circuit voltage (V-oc) of 1.223 V with 387 mV loss in potential, which is among the highest reported value for PSCs with negligible hysteresis. The stability results show that the device on c-TiO2/a-SnO2 retains about 91% of its initial PCE value after 500 h light illumination, which is higher than pure c-TiO2 (67%) based devices. Interestingly, using a-SnO2/c-TiO2 ETL the PCE loss was only 10% of initial value under continuous UV light illumination after 30 h, which is higher than that of c-TiO2 based device (28% PCE loss).

Solvent additives can provide fine control of the active layer morphology of OPVs by influencing film formation during solution processing. As such, solvent additives form a versatile method of experimental control for improving organic solar cell device performance. This review provides a brief history of solution-processed bulk heterojunction OPVs and the advent of solvent additives, putting them into context with other methods available for morphology control. It presents the current understanding of how solvent additives impact various mechanisms of phase separation, enabled by recent advances in in situ morphology characterization. Indeed, understanding solvent additives' effects on film formation has allowed them to be applied and combined effectively and synergistically to boost OPV performance. Their success as a morphology control strategy has also prompted the use of solvent additives in related organic semiconductor technologies. Finally, the role of solvent additives in the development of next-generation OPV active layers is discussed. Despite concerns over their environmental toxicity and role in device instability, solvent additives remain relevant morphological directing agents as research interests evolve toward nonfullerene acceptors, ternary blends, and environmentally sustainable solvents.

However, their incompatibility with a typical lithography process makes it difficult to fabricate integrated device arrays and extract basic optical and electronic parameters from individual devices. Here, we develop a combination of solution synthesis and a gas-solid-phase intercalation strategy to achieve hexagonal-shaped 2D perovskite microplates and arrays for functional optoelectronics. The 2D perovskite microplates were achieved by first synthesizing the lead iodide (PbI2) microplates from an aqueous solution and then following with intercalation via the vapor transport method. This method further allows us to synthesize arrays of 2D perovskite microplates and create individual 2D perovskite microplate-based photodetectors. In particular, chlorine (Cl) can be efficiently incorporated into the microplates, resulting in significantly improved performance of the 2D perovskite microplate-based photodetectors.

J	Wang, CC; Gao, YL				Wang, Congcong; Gao, Yongli			Stability of Perovskites at the Surface Analytic Level	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article							HOLE-TRANSPORTING MATERIAL; SENSITIZED SOLAR-CELLS; CH3NH3PBI3 PEROVSKITE; SINGLE-CRYSTALS; THIN-FILM; INDUCED DEGRADATION; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; LEAD IODIDE; DEPOSITION	Organic-inorganic halide perovskites have attracted considerable attention in the past few years because of their remarkable performance in optoelectronic devices. However, long-term stability of the materials and devices remains the biggest challenge for realistic implementation of perovskite solar cells. Although significant efforts have been carried out on the causes of degradation at the device level, few measurements have been made at the surface analytic level to reveal the degradation mechanisms. In this Perspective, we review the effects of environmental factors, such as O-2, water, and light, on the perovskite layer by monitoring the intrinsic electronic structure and compositional changes in different exposure tests. This work contributes in developing better understanding of the degradation mechanisms and improving the overall stability of perovskite solar cells.

In spite of intensive research efforts toward the development of HTL materials, low-cost, dopant-free hole transporting materials that lead to efficient and stable PSCs remain elusive. Herein, a simple polycyclic heteroaromatic hydrocarbon-based small molecule, 2,5,9,12-tetra(tert-butyl)diacenaphtho[1,2-b:1',2'-d]thiophenen, as an efficient HTL material in PSCs is presented. This molecule is easy to synthesize and inexpensive. It is hydrophobic and exhibits excellent film-forming properties on perovskites. It has unusually high hole mobility and a desirable highest occupied molecular orbital energy level, making it an ideal HTL material. PSCs fabricated using both the n-i-p planar and mesoscopic architectures with this compound as the HTL show efficiencies as high as 15.59% and 18.17%, respectively, with minimal hysteresis and high long term stability under ambient conditions.

To successfully transition PSC technology from the laboratory to industry scale, substantial efforts need to focus on scalable fabrication of high-performance perovskite modules with minimum negative environmental impact. Here, we provide an overview of the current research and our perspective regarding PSC technology toward future large-scale manufacturing and deployment. Several key challenges discussed are (1) a scalable process for large-area perovskite module fabrication; (2) less hazardous chemical routes for PSC fabrication; and (3) suitable perovskite module designs for different applications.

J	Wu, T; Ahmadi, M; Hu, B				Wu, Ting; Ahmadi, Mahshid; Hu, Bin			Giant current amplification induced by ion migration in perovskite single crystal photodetectors	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							ORGANOMETAL TRIHALIDE PEROVSKITE; X-RAY-DETECTORS; SOLAR-CELLS; LEAD-IODIDE; PERFORMANCE; EFFICIENT; CONDUCTION; HYSTERESIS; GROWTH; CL	Single crystals of organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites have become attractive candidates for application in photodetection and high-energy radiation detection based on a unique solution growth method with a large interacting cross-section with electromagnetic waves in different energy regimes and high drift mobilities through optically induced polarization. However, inevitable ion migration often represents a technical difficulty in controlling the detection performance. This work reports giant current amplification induced by ion migration in the MAPbI(3) single crystal photodetectors with a lateral geometry of Au/MAPbI(3)/C-60/BCP/Ag based on light soaking studies. Upon light soaking, a stabilized device can demonstrate a giant amplification factor reaching 600 at -2 V under weak light illumination (1 mW cm(-2)). The time-dependent current profile shows a slow response during amplification under light soaking. This indicates that optically activated ions are driven away from working areas to the respective electrodes, leading to the reduction of dark current by decreasing bulk defects. Simultaneously, the accumulation of iodine anions and methylammonium cations at Ag and Au contacts can trigger the counter charge injection, largely amplifying the total electrical current and leading to giant current amplification in perovskite single crystal photodetectors.

The quality of perovskite films is crucial to device performance, and introducing additives to the precursor solution is an effective way to control the film morphology and to reduce the defect density. In this paper, formamidine acetate salt (FAAc) is introduced into the precursor solution as an effective additive to greatly improve the quality of perovskite films. With the addition of 5 mol% FAAc, the PSCs with a bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine (PTAA) hole extraction layer demonstrate desirable performance in terms of the open-circuit voltage (1.04 V), the short-circuit current density (23.16 mA cm(-2)), the fill factor (close to 80%), the power conversion efficiency (18.90%), negligible hysteresis, and the device stability up to 80 days). These results will provide a new avenue for fabricating commercial perovskite solar cells.

The addition of small amounts of AgNPs (e.g., 5 wt. %) into the PCBM improved the overall reproducibility and reliability of the solar cell fabrication process after optimization. Plasmonic simulations suggest that any plasmonic-optical effects are relatively small compared to sample absorbance due to perovskite alone. It has been concluded that plasmonic-electrical effects play a major role in averaged performance improvement. Therefore, the addition of small AgNPs in low concentration to the EEL layer accounts for higher J(sc), V-oc and FF as a result of a better perovskite coverage by the EEL and an improved charge carrier collection as evidenced by morphological and electrical analysis.

Herein, we report success in suppressing hysteresis and record efficiency for planar-type devices using EDTA-complexed tin oxide (SnO2) electron-transport layer. The Fermi level of EDTA-complexed SnO2 is better matched with the conduction band of perovskite, leading to high open-circuit voltage. Its electron mobility is about three times larger than that of the SnO2. The record power conversion efficiency of planar-type PSCs with EDTA-complexed SnO2 increases to 21.60% (certified at 21.52% by Newport) with negligible hysteresis. Meanwhile, the low-temperature processed EDTA-complexed SnO2 enables 18.28% efficiency for a flexible device. Moreover, the unsealed PSCs with EDTA-complexed SnO2 degrade only by 8% exposed in an ambient atmosphere after 2880 h, and only by 14% after 120 h under irradiation at 100 mW cm(-2).

The dynamically evolving research field of PVKSCs has made immense progress in solving inherent challenges and capitalizing on their unique structure-property-processing-performance traits. This review offers a unique outlook on the paths toward commercialization of PVKSCs from the interfacial engineering perspective, relevant to both specialists and nonspecialists in the field through a brief introduction of the background of the field, current state-of-the-art evolution, and future research prospects. The multifaceted role of interfaces in facilitating PVKSC development is explained. Beneficial impacts of diverse charge-transporting materials and interfacial modifications are summarized. In addition, the role of interfaces in improving efficiency and stability for all emerging areas of PVKSC design are also evaluated. The authors' integral contributions in this area are highlighted on all fronts. Finally, future research opportunities for interfacial material development and applications along with scalability-durability-sustainability considerations pivotal for facilitating laboratory to industry translation are presented.

Silver-bismuth double perovskites have recently gained attention, but evaluating their carrier lifetime and recombination mechanisms from photoluminescence measurements is challenging due to their indirect bandgap. In this work, transient absorption spectroscopy is used to directly track the photocarrier population in Cs2AgBiBr6 by measuring the ground state bleach dynamics. A small initial drop is resolved in the ground state bleach on a picosecond timescale, after which the remaining photocarriers decay monoexponentially with a lifetime of 1.4 mu s. The majority of the early-time decay is attributed to hot-carrier thermalization from the direct transition to the indirect bandgap, and the 1.4 mu s lifetime represents the recombination of most photocarriers. From this lifetime, a steady-state excess carrier density of 2.2 x 10(16) cm(-3) under 1 sun is calculated, which is an order of magnitude larger than that for methylammonium lead iodide, suggesting that charge transport and extraction can be efficient in Cs2AgBiBr6 solar cells.

Elucidation of Chemical Species and Reactivity at Methylammonium Lead Iodide and Cesium Tin Bromide Perovskite Surfaces via Orthogonal Reaction Chemistry	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; HALIDE PEROVSKITE; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; HIGH-EFFICIENCY; CH3NH3PBI3; BEHAVIOR; TERMINATION; COMPLEXES; PHOTOLUMINESCENCE	We quantified the chemical species present at and reactivity of the (100) face of tetrahedral single-crystal methylammonium lead iodide, MAPbI(3)(100), and polycrystalline cesium tin bromide, CsSnBr3. For these ABX(3) perovskites, experiments utilized the orthogonal reactivity of the A(+)-site cation, the B2+-site cation, and the X--site halide anion. Ambient pressure exposure to BF3 solutions probed the reactivity of interfacial halides. Reactions with p-trifluorome-thylanilinium chloride probed the exchange reactivity of the At-site cation. A complex-forming ligand, 4,4'-bis-(trifluoromethyl)-2,2'-bipyridine, probed for interfacial B2+ site cations. Fluorine features in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) quantified reaction outcomes for each solution-phase species. XPS revealed adsorption of BF3, indicating surface-available halide anions on both MAPbI(3)(100) and on CsSnBr3. Temperature-programmed desorption quantified a similar to 200 kJ mol(-1) desorption activation energy from MAPbI(3)(100) and a similar to 215 kJ mol(-1) desorption energy from CsSnBr3. Adsorption of the fluorinated anilinium cation included no concomitant adsorption of chlorine as revealed by the absence of Cl 2p features within the limits of XPS detection. We interpret the observation of the anilinium species as exchanging for interfacial methylammonium species on MAPbI(3)(100) surfaces and interfacial cesium on the polycrystalline CsSnBr3 surface. Within detection limits, the bipyridine ligand demonstrated no adsorption to MAPbI(3)(100), suggestive of a Pb2+ deficient surface, but adsorption to the polycrystalline CsSnBr3 that suggests surface-accessible Sn2+. The combination of results implies that methylammonium cations and iodide anions dominate tetragonal MAPbI(3)(100) surface that, respectively, enables cation exchange and Lewis adduct formation for surface derivatization. We discuss the present results in the context of interfacial stability, passivation, and reactivity for perovskite-based energy conversion.

To the best of knowledge the first flexible wire-shaped perovskite photodetector is reported. The performance of the wire-shaped perovskite photodetector on carbon nanotube yarn (CNY) critically depends on the surface geometry and annealing conditions. The use of joule heating method for uniform control of temperature on CNY surface results in smooth perovskite crystalline films, which are used to produce self-powering photodetectors with strong responsivity (10.2 A W-1), detectivity (1.76 x 10(11) J), and I-light/I-dark (45). This development displays the role of joule heating in the annealing process and demonstrates a cheap, repeatable method for the fabrication of self-powered perovskite photodetectors.

This study reveals that the perovskite device hysteresis and performance heavily rely on the perovskite grain boundary conditions. More specifically, they are predetermined through the molecular interaction between Lewis base atoms of HEMs and perovskites. It is revealed that only changing the side chain terminals (-OCH3, -SCH3, and -SOCH3) of HEMs results in effective modulating PVSC performance and hysteresis, due to the effective tune of interaction strength between HEM and perovskite. With an in situ grown perovskite-HEM bulk heterojunction structure, PB2T-O with weak binding group (-OCH3, -78.9 kcal mol(-1) bonding energy) to lead ions allows delivering hysteresis-free and efficient devices, which is sharp contrast to the strong binding PB2T-SO (-119.3 kcal mol(-1) bonding energy). Overall, this work provides new insights on PVSC hysteresis and the related curing methods via multifunctional HEM design in PVSCs.

Dynamically Disordered Lattice in a Layered Pb-I-SCN Perovskite Thin Film Probed by Two-Dimensional Infrared Spectroscopy	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							ORGANOMETAL HALIDE PEROVSKITES; LEAD IODIDE PEROVSKITE; WHITE-LIGHT EMISSION; SOLAR-CELLS; 2D IR; ORGANIC CATION; STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; HYBRID PEROVSKITES; HYDROGEN-BOND	The dynamically flexible lattices in lead halide perovskites may play important roles in extending carrier recombination lifetime in 3D perovskite solar-cell absorbers and in exciton self-trapping in 2D perovskite white-light phosphors. Two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy was applied to study a recently reported Pb-I-SCN layered perovskite. The Pb-I-SCN perovskite was spin-coated on a SiO2 surface as a thin film, with a thickness of similar to 100 nm, where the (SCN-)-C-12 anions were isotopically diluted with the ratio of (SCN)-C-12:(SCN)-C-13 = 5:95 to avoid vibrational coupling and excitation transfer between adjacent SCN- anions. The (CN)-C-12 stretch mode of the minor (SCN-)-C-12 component was the principal vibrational probe that reported on the structural evolution through 2D IR spectroscopy. Spectral diffusion was observed with a time constant of 4.1 +/- 0.3 ps. Spectral diffusion arises from small structural changes that result in sampling of frequencies within the distribution of frequencies comprising the inhomogeneously broadened infrared absorption band. These transitions among discrete local structures are distinct from oscillatory phonon motions of the lattice. To accurately evaluate the structural dynamics through measurement of spectral diffusion, the vibrational coupling between adjacent SCN- anions had to be carefully treated. Although the inorganic layers of typical 2D perovskites are structurally isolated from each other, the 2D IR data demonstrated that the layers of the Pb-I-SCN perovskite are vibrationally coupled. When both (SCN-)-C-12 and (SCN-)-C-13 were pumped simultaneously, cross-peaks between (SCN)-C-12 and (SCN)-C-13 vibrations and an oscillating 2D band shape of the (SCN-)-C-12 vibration were observed. Both observables demonstrate vibrational coupling between the closest SCN- anions, which reside in different inorganic layers. The thin films and the isotopic dilution produced exceedingly small vibrational echo signal fields; measurements were made possible using the near-Brewster's angle reflection pump-probe geometry.

All current high performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs), including the most recent world records, were achieved using the so-called anti-solvent method. Here, an anti-solvent, typically chlorobenzene (CB), is used to induce rapid crystallisation of a liquid perovskite precursor resulting in highly homogenous, pinhole-free planar perovskite films. While this has yielded very impressive high-performance results, few efforts have been dedicated to the fundamental understanding of the anti-solvent method. In this work, a systematic study is employed to understand the influence of anti-solvent treatment on both morphological and optoelectronic characteristics of PSCs. Perovskite absorber films were treated using CB and isopropanol (IPA) for comparing anti-solvents with different polarities. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) show that IPA treated perovskite films have a more uniform morphology with larger grains in comparison to CB processed perovskite films. Despite the improved morphology and solar cell performance the devices with IPA treated perovskites suffer from higher hysteresis during current density-voltage (J-V) scans. We found that this enhanced hysteresis stems mainly from higher charge accumulation at the TiO2/perovskite interface under illumination that could also lead to formation of excess electrostatic potential contributing to an increased open circuit voltage (V-oc). Our study provides a way for in-depth spectroscopic analysis methods aiding a deeper understanding of the interfacial charge characteristics and the fundamental mechanisms of PSCs.

To date, achieving metastability is usually accomplished by rapid quenching through a thermodynamic path function, namely, heating-cooling cycles. However, heat can be detrimental to organic-containing materials because it can induce degradation. Alternatively, the application of pressure can be used to achieve metastable states that are inaccessible via heating-cooling cycles. Here we report metastable states of 2D organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites reached through structural amorphization under compression followed by recrystallization via decompression. Remarkably, such pressure-derived metastable states in 2D hybrid perovskites exhibit enduring bandgap narrowing by as much as 8.2% with stability under ambient conditions. The achieved metastable states in 2D hybrid perovskites via compression-decompression cycles offer an alternative pathway toward manipulating the properties of these "soft" materials.

All inorganic cesium (Cs) based perovskite is an alternative to avoid the release or decomposition of organic cations. Moreover, substituting Pb with Sn in the organic-inorganic lead halide perovskites has been demonstrated to narrow the bandgap to 1.2-1.4 eV for high-performance perovskite solar cells. In this work, a series of CsPb1-xSnxIBr2 perovskite alloys via one-step antisolvent method is demonstrated. These perovskite films present tunable bandgaps from 2.04 to 1.64 eV. Consequently, the CsPb0.75Sn0.25IBr2 with homogeneous and densely crystallized morphology shows a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 11.53% and a high V-oc of 1.21 V with a much improved phase stability and illumination stability. This work provides a possibility for designing and synthesizing novel inorganic halide perovskites as the next generation of photovoltaic materials.

However, they suffer from the phase-instability issue in the ambient atmosphere, which is holding back the realization of the full potential of FA-based PSCs in the context of high efficiency and stability. Herein, the tetraethylorthosilicate hydrolysis process is integrated with the solution crystallization of FA-based perovskites, forming a new film structure with individual perovskite grains encapsulated by amorphous silica layers that are in situ formed at the nanoscale. The silica not only protects perovskite grains from the degradation but also enhances the charge-carrier dynamics of perovskite films.

Dipolar cations confer defect tolerance in wide-bandgap metal halide perovskites	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							TANDEM SOLAR-CELLS; TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; EFFICIENT; LIFETIMES; CARRIERS; ORIGIN; FILMS	Efficient wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells (PSCs) enable high-efficiency tandem photo-voltaics when combined with crystalline silicon and other low-bandgap absorbers. However, wide-bandgap PSCs today exhibit performance far inferior to that of sub-1.6-eV bandgap PSCs due to their tendency to form a high density of deep traps. Here, we show that healing the deep traps in wide-bandgap perovskites-in effect, increasing the defect tolerance via cation engineering-enables further performance improvements in PSCs. We achieve a stabilized power conversion efficiency of 20.7% for 1.65-eV bandgap PSCs by incorporating dipolar cations, with a high open-circuit voltage of 1.22 V and a fill factor exceeding 80%. We also obtain a stabilized efficiency of 19.1% for 1.74-eV bandgap PSCs with a high open-circuit voltage of 1.25 V. From density functional theory calculations, we find that the presence and reorientation of the dipolar cation in mixed cation-halide perovskites heals the defects that introduce deep trap states.

Among numerous HTMs that are studied so far, the single-spiro-based compounds are the most frequently used HTMs for achieving highly efficient PVSCs. In fact, all the new spiro-based HTMs reported so far that render PVSCs over 20% are based on spiro[fluorene-9,9'-xanthene] or spiro [cyclopenta [2,1-b:3,4b']dithiophene-4,9'-fluorene] cores; therefore, there is a need to diversify the design of their structures for further improving their function and performance. In addition, the fundamental understanding of structure-performance relationships for the spiro-based HTMs is still lagging, for example, how molecular configuration, spiro numbers, and heteroatoms in spiro-rings impact the efficacy of HTMs. To address these needs, two novel H-shaped HTMs, G1 and G2 based on the di-spiro-rings as the cores are designed and synthesized. The combined good film-forming properties, better interactions with perovskite, slightly deeper highest occupied molecular orbital, higher mobility and conductivity, as well as more efficient charge transfer for G2 help devices reach a very impressive power conversion efficiency of 20.2% and good stability. This is the first report of demonstrating the feasibility of using di-spiro-based HTMs for highly efficient PVSCs.

Dual layers of dense and mesoporous TiO2/graphitic oxide nanocomposite films are synthesized simultaneously using inkjet printing and pulsed photonic irradiation. Investigation of process parameters including precursor concentration (10-20 wt%) and exposure fluence (4.5-8.5 J cm(-2)) reveals control over crystalline quality, graphitic oxide phase, film thickness, dendrite density, and optical properties. Raman spectroscopy shows the E-g peak, characteristic of anatase phase titania, increases in intensity with higher photonic irradiation fluence, suggesting increased crystallinity through higher fluence processing. Film thickness and dendrite density is shown to increase with precursor concentration in the printed ink. The dense base layer thickness was controlled between 20 and 80 nm. The refractive index of the films is determined by ellipsometry to be 1.92 +/- 0.08 at 650 nm. Films exhibit an energy weighted optical transparency of 91.1%, in comparison to 91.3% of a thermally processed film, when in situ carbon materials were removed. Transmission and diffuse reflectance are used to determine optical band gaps of the films ranging from 2.98 to 3.38 eV in accordance with the photonic irradiation fluence and suggests tunability of TiO2 phase composition. The sheet resistance of the synthesized films is measured to be 14.54 +/- 1.11 Omega/square and 28.90 +/- 2.24 Omega/square for films as-processed and after carbon removal, respectively, which is comparable to high temperature processed TiO2 thin films. The studied electrical and optical properties of the light processed films show comparable results to traditionally processed TiO2 while offering the distinct advantages of scalable manufacturing, low-temperature processing, simultaneous bilayer fabrication, and in situ formation of removable carbon nanocomposites.

Herein, we report a study of the pressure-induced structural and optical evolutions of FAPbI(3) hybrid organic- inorganic perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) using a synchrotron-based X-ray scattering technique coupled to in situ absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopies. As a result of their unique structural stability and soft nature, FAPbI(3) NCs exhibit a wide range of band-gap tunability (1.44-2.17 eV) as a function of pressure (0-13.4 GPa). The study presented here not only provides an efficient and chemically orthogonal means to controllably engineer the band gap of FAPbI(3) NCs using pressure but more importantly sheds light on how to strategically design the band gaps of FA-based hybrid organic inorganic perovskites for various optoelectronic applications.

The phonon plays a significant role in the properties of hybrid perovskites. Coherent phonon refers to the in-phase vibration of the crystal lattice. Here, temperature-dependent, fluence-dependent, and polarization-dependent transient absorption spectroscopy is utilized to study the coherent phonon in methylammonium lead iodide. A coherent optical phonon is observed due to the existence of Pb-I-Pb angular distortion at 24-33 cm(-1) in both tetragonal and orthorhombic phases. Oscillation from the excited-state absorption is also observed, suggesting coupling between the coherent phonon and photoexcited state. Oscillation of the coherent phonon attenuates with increasing environmental temperature. The dependence of the coherent phonon on polarization of the pulse and quantitative analysis indicates that the generation mechanism is impulsive stimulated Raman scattering and transient depletion field screening.

Herein, using temperature dependent photoluminescence studies, we show that the stated photoinduced phase separation occurs only in a narrow temperature range and above a particular bromine concentration. Our observation of the disappearance of phase separation at elevated temperatures suggests the possibility that these tandem solar cells may indeed work better at elevated temperatures. Further, we provide the first experimental proof for the demixing transition temperature as too predicted by Bischak et al. and also observe that demixing and remixing temperatures are pinned to crystallographic phase transition temperatures. Longer carrier lifetime of iodide-rich clusters is observed confirming the strong electron phonon interaction (polaronic effect) which is absent in the initial mixed states.

Piperazine Suppresses Self-Doping in CsSnI3 Perovskite Solar Cells	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						perovskite; lead-free; solar cells; piperazine; diamine	TIN-BASED PEROVSKITE; LEAD-FREE; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; PERFORMANCE; FABRICATION; SEMICONDUCTOR; SUBSTITUTION; EFFICIENCY; ATMOSPHERE; STABILITY	Tin-based halide perovskite materials are promising candidates for lead-free halide perovskite solar cells. However, they suffer from poor device reproducibility and limited overall power conversion efficiencies due to their tendency to become semimetallic from p-type defect states. Herein, we demonstrate an effective approach to address this issue via the addition of piperazine to the precursor solution of tin-based halide perovskite films, to suppress the undesirable p-doping of CsSnI3 films. Piperazine is found to significantly reduce the conductivity of CsSnI3 films, improve the film coverage, and at the same time suppress the crystallization of excess SnI2. Consequently, short-circuit behaviors are eliminated, with significantly improved CsSnI3 solar-cell performance. Moreover, the effects of incorporating SnCl2 and SnF2 into the CsSnI3 devices were investigated in conjunction with addition of piperazine to achieve CsSnI3 devices with a maximum power conversion efficiency of 3.83%.

PEOz-PEDOT:PSS Composite Layer: A Route to Suppressed Hysteresis and Enhanced Open-Circuit Voltage in a Planar Perovskite Solar Cell	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						perovskite solar cells; PEOz; PEDOT:PSS; V-oc; hysteresis	HOLE TRANSPORT LAYER; EFFICIENCY; PERFORMANCE; MORPHOLOGY; IODIDE	The successful commercialization of perovskite solar cells (Pvs-SCs) calls for the need to find low-temperature processable interlayers with outstanding charge-transport features. In this work, we strategically blend poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (PEOz) with PEDOT:PSS as the modified hole transport layer (HTL) to achieve high-efficiency P-I-N CH3NH3PbI3 Pvs-SCs. The PEOzPEDOT:PSS HTL exhibits enhanced features over the conventional layer including the following: (1) promoting perovskite with enlarged grain sizes to decrease the perovskite layer's recombination, (2) increasing the work function of the HTL, and (3) decreasing the noncapacitive current in Pvs-SCs. Remarkably, we demonstrate a 17.39% power conversion efficiency with very low hysteresis and high V-oc values of 1.075 V for Pvs-SCs with PEOz-PEDOT:PSS.

Cubic or Orthorhombic?

Here, we challenge this assumption. We present structural refinement of room-temperature black-phase CsPbI3 in an orthorhombic polymorph. We demonstrate that this polymorph is adopted by both powders and thin films of black-phase CsPbI3, fabricated either by high-or low-temperature processes. We perform electronic band structure calculations for the orthorhombic polymorph and find agreement with experimental data and close similarities with orthorhombic methylammonium lead iodide. We investigate the structural transitions and thermodynamic stability of the various polymorphs of CsPbI3 and show that the orthorhombic polymorph is the most stable among its other perovskite polymorphs, but it remains less stable than the yellow nonperovskite polymorph.

Herein, a new RP perovskite, the fifth member (< n > = 5) of the (CH3(CH2)(2)NH3)(2)(CH3NH3)(n-1)PbnI3n+1 family (abbreviated as PA(2)MA(4)Pb(5)I(16)), was synthesized and systematically investigated in terms of photovoltaic application. The obtained pure PA(2)MA(4)Pb(5)I(16) crystal exhibits a direct band gap of E-g = 1.85 eV. Systematic analysis on the solid film highlights the key role of the precursor-solvent interaction in the quantum well orientation, phase purity, grain size, surface quality, and optoelectronic properties, which can be well tuned with addition of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) into the N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) precursor solution. These findings present opportunities for designing a high-quality RP film with well-controlled quantum well orientation, micrometer-sized grains, and optoelectronic properties. As a result, we achieved power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 10.41%.

Broadband light incoupling in solar cells can be achieved by using hexagonally arranged arrays of nipples or domes with parabolically shaped surface profiles. The moth eye surface texture represents a refractive index grating that allows for an efficient incoupling of light in the solar cell while minimizing reflection losses. The light incoupling is studied for perovskite and amorphous silicon solar cells. Perovskite has a rather low refractive index of 2.5, while amorphous silicon exhibits a refractive index of -4.5 comparable to that of crystalline silicon. Due to largely different refractive indices, different device designs must be selected to allow for an efficient light incoupling in the solar cell. 3D finite-difference time-domain simulations are used for the optical modeling. Design guidelines are provided on how to realize perovskite and silicon thin film solar cells with high quantum efficiency and short-circuit current by using moth eye textures.

Rapid route to efficient, scalable, and robust perovskite photovoltaics in air	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; HALIDE PEROVSKITE; CH3NH3PBI3 PEROVSKITE; FILMS; HUMIDITY; EMERGENCE; GROWTH; LIGHT	We demonstrate a scalable atmospheric plasma route to rapidly form efficient and mechanically robust photoactive metal halide perovskite films in open air at linear deposition rates exceeding 4 cm s(-1). Our plasma process uses clean dry air to produce a combination of reactive energetic species (ions, radicals, metastables, and photons) and convective thermal energy to rapidly convert the perovskite precursor solution after spray-coating. Such high energy species dissociate the precursor and superheat the solvent, quickly and efficiently curing the perovskite film. Synchrotron X-ray radiation enabled in situ wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) measurements with high time resolution. The ultrafast crystallization kinetics are governed by rapid nucleation and growth during the plasma exposure, followed by continued grain growth during cooling. We deposit pinhole-free, robust CH3NH3PbI3 films with a ten-fold increase in fracture toughness, a key metric for reliability. Planar devices exhibited remarkably consistent performance with 15.7% power conversion efficiency (PCE) without hysteresis and an improved open-circuit voltage (V-OC). This excellent performance is attributed to lower defect densities, as measured by external quantum efficiency, steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence. Large-area devices were made with a strip of 10 samples, and a 13.4% average PCE was measured on a total of 2.4 cm(2) electrode area.

Three-Dimensional Graphene Nanostructures	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							PEROVSKITE SOLAR-CELLS; CYCLIC VOLTAMMETRY; NANORIBBONS; TRIPTYCENE; PERFORMANCE; DERIVATIVES; FULLERENES; STABILITY; BANDGAP	This Communication details the implementation of a new concept for the design of high-performance optoelectronic materials: three-dimensional (3D) graphene nanostructures. This general strategy is showcased through the synthesis of a three-bladed propeller nanostructure resulting from the coupling and fusion of a central triptycene hub and helical graphene nanoribbons. Importantly, these 3D graphene nanostructures show remarkable new properties that are distinct from the substituent parts. For example, the larger nanostructures show an enhancement in absorption and decreased contact resistance in optoelectronic devices. To show these enhanced properties in a device setting, the nanostructures were utilized as the electron-extracting layers in perovskite solar cells. The largest of these nanostructures achieved a PCE of 18.0%, which is one of the highest values reported for non-fullerene electron-extracting layers.

However, developing photocatalysts with high efficiency in a wide range of visible light is still a formidable challenge. Here, we report on a highly active system for photocatalytic hydrogen production from hydroiodic acid splitting that contains a soluble organic-inorganic hybrid PtIx/[(CH3)(2)NH2](3)[BiI6] as a newcomer photocatalyst for harvesting a wide range of visible light (up to 630 nm). Under irradiation at 465 nm, the photocatalytic system achieves apparent quantum yield of similar to 82.8% for photocatalytic hydrogen production along with a stable activity for at least 100 h. We propose that the superior photocatalytic performance is attributed to collisions between [BiI6](3)(-) and Pt ions (Pt2+ or Pt4+), giving rise to efficient charge separation, which could be an effective approach towards designing and fabricating organic-inorganic semiconductors with improved performance in photocatalysis.

Introducing a photoluminescent conversion layer by converting NIR or UV light into visible which can be effectively utilized by perovskite photoactive layer has been considered as a very promising route. In this work, on the basis of a novel NiO/Ag/NiO transparent electrode, the NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+/NaYF4: Yb3+, Tm3+/Ag composite layers were introduced on the backlight side of the PSCs device by the pulsed laser deposition (PLD). This design enables multi-functional effects, harvesting NIR light and converting to visible, plasmonic scattering, reflection and luminescent enhancement. In this device, we observed considerable enhancement of PCE depending strongly on the power density of sunlight. Simultaneously, acting as an efficient encapsulation layer, the device also greatly boosted the long-term stability of PSCs in ambient conditions. Furthermore, a typical UV to visible Eu(TTA)(2)(Phen)MAA down-conversion (DC) layer was introduced on the incident light side of PSCs, leading to improvement of PCE and light stability of PSCs. Overall, the upconversion (UC) and DC effects give rise to the highest PCE performance of 19.5% and noticeable current density (J(sc)) value of 27.1 mA cm(-2) among the reported transparent PSCs, suggesting the great potential for application in spectral broadening and stability enhancement of PSCs.

Material Dimensionality Effects on Electron Transfer Rates Between CsPbBr3 and CdSe Nanoparticles	NANO LETTERS			English	Article						Nanoplatelets; electron transfer; dimensionality; perovskites; spectroscopy	SEMICONDUCTOR QUANTUM DOTS; NANOCRYSTAL SOLAR-CELLS; CESIUM LEAD HALIDE; PEROVSKITE NANOCRYSTALS; AUGER RECOMBINATION; TRANSFER DYNAMICS; CHARGE-TRANSFER; ENERGY-TRANSFER; NANOPLATELETS; SUPERLATTICES	Films containing mixtures of zero- or two-dimensional nanostructures (quantum dots or nanoplatelets) were prepared in order to investigate the impacts of dimensionality on electronic interactions. Electron transfer from CsPbBr3 to CdSe was observed in all of the mixtures, regardless of particle dimensionality, and characterized via both static and transient absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopies. We find that mixtures containing nanoplatelets as the electron acceptor (CdSe) undergo charge transfer more rapidly than those containing quantum dots. We believe the faster charge transfer observed with nanoplatelets may arise from the extended spatial area of the CdSe nanoplatelets and/ or the continuous density of acceptor states that are present in nanoplatelets. These results bolster the use of one- or two-dimensional nanomaterials in the place of zero-dimensional quantum dots in the design of related optoelectronic devices such as solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and photocatalysts and further offer the prospect of fewer required hopping events to transport carriers due to the larger spatial extent of the particles.

However, this comes alongside an undesirable increase in bandgap that sacrifices the device photo-current. Here we report the fabrication of phase-pure formamidinium-lead tri-iodide perovskite films with excellent optoelectronic quality and stability. Incorporation of 1.67 mol% of 2D phenylethylammonium lead iodide into the precursor solution enables the formation of phase-pure formamidinium perovskite with an order of magnitude enhanced photoluminescence lifetime. The 2D perovskite spontaneously forms at grain boundaries to protect the formamidinium perovskite from moisture and suppress ion migration. A stabilized power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.64% (certified stabilized PCE of 19.77%) is achieved with a short-circuit current density exceeding 24 mA cm(-2) and an open-circuit voltage of 1.130 V, corresponding to a loss-in-potential of 0.35 V, and significantly enhanced operational stability.

Energy losses during charge separation at the donor-acceptor interface and non-radiative recombination are among the main causes of such voltage losses. Here we combine spectroscopic and quantum-chemistry approaches to identify key rules for minimizing voltage losses: (1) a low energy offset between donor and acceptor molecular states and (2) high photoluminescence yield of the low-gap material in the blend. Following these rules, we present a range of existing and new donor-acceptor systems that combine efficient photocurrent generation with electroluminescence yield up to 0.03%, leading to non-radiative voltage losses as small as 0.21 V. This study provides a rationale to explain and further improve the performance of recently demonstrated high-open-circuit-voltage organic solar cells.

Impact of excess lead on the stability and photo-induced degradation of lead halide perovskite solar cells	ORGANIC ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Photo-degradation; Stability; Perovskite; Methylammonium lead iodide; Lead iodide	EFFICIENT; PASSIVATION; TEMPERATURE; PERFORMANCE; LIGHT; LAYER; FILMS	The stability of perovskite solar cells exposed to prolonged solar irradiation is a major concern that has not been thoroughly investigated in the past. In this investigation, devices fabricated with the architecture, glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI(3)/PCBM/Ag using Pb acetate as a source material, were found to operate with an efficiency of about 13%. Adding excess amounts of Pb to the precursor resulted in a presence of Pb in the perovskite (PVS) active layer. In addition, the impact of photo-induced degradation on the device efficiency was investigated. Xray Diffraction and Time-resolved Photoluminescence analyses were used to evaluate the impact of excess Pb before and after illumination. The results indicate that changes in the crystallinity occur without any significant decrease in charge carrier lifetimes, and this is attributed to the formation of the degradation product, PbI2. This by-product has been shown to have beneficial effects due to its influence in passivating grain boundaries and in altering the band structure at the interface between the active layer and the electron transport layer. This work demonstrates that 5 mol% excess Pb is the optimal concentration with respect to efficiency and stability of these devices. The devices can retain more than 50% of their initial efficiency after 1 h of simulated solar exposure, when compared to 0 mol% and 10 mol% excess Pb samples.

Photo-catalysis effect is a highly concerned issue for such TiO2 based devices because of its impact on device stability. To deal with the problem, a strategy was proposed to passivate the surface of TiO2 by a thin layer of in-situ formed SnO2, and then perovskite solar cells (PSCs) were prepared using such modified TiO2. It was observed that, after the surface passivation, photo-to-electric power conversion efficiency, hysteresis as well as stability of the TiO2 based PSCs were all improved. For example, efficiency increased from 14.92 (+/- 1.86)% (AM 1.5G, 100 mW/cm(2)) to 16.33 (+/- 0.26)%; hysteresis index decreased from 20.49 (+/- 11.85)% to 1.40 (+/- 0.01)%. As for stability, after being stored for 25 days (relative humidity of about 45%, no encapsulation), efficiency could preserve 73.99% of the original value, comparing to 47.55% for device based on bare TiO2. Moreover, the passivation was found to accelerate electron extraction, while retard charge recombination between perovskite and TiO2. The improvement was ascribed to the enhanced contact between perovskite and bottom electron-transport-material, passivated surface defects of TiO2 by SnO2, as well as the high mobility of SnO2. Finally, designated ultraviolet (UV) illumination experiment showed that SnO2 passivation could obviously retard the photocatalysis activity of TiO2, thus improve the UV stability of the devices.

Recently, solar cells based on the organic-inorganic lead halide perovskites have emerged as a promising avenue toward high power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, the investigations on achieving high operating voltage with sufficient output power remains a missing part for the halide perovskite solar cells. Here the effectiveness of employing both anode and cathode interfacial modification layers to reach high open-circuit voltage (V-OC) for the methylammonium lead tribromide (MAPbBr(3)) perovskite solar cells is demonstrated. Specifically, high work function e-beam processed MoOx layer with vacuum annealing treatment is used to reengineer the anode interface and an atomic layer deposited ZrO2 layer is used to modify the cathode interface, respectively. The minimized energy barrier height by MoOx modification and hole-blocking effect by ZrO2 synergistically restrain the charge carrier recombination loss and render a consequent larger quasi-Fermi level separation that endows a higher V-OC. The MAPbBr(3) perovskite solar cell with a highest PCE of 10.08% and a new record V-OC of 1653mV under one sun-illumination are demonstrated.

Yet, the perovskites have not been extensively used by the researchers for diode applications. In this study, both Al/p-type Si and Al/perovskite/p-type Si devices have been obtained. We used a facile and cost-effective way of making perovskite thin film layer between the ultra-thin metal and semiconductor as an interfacial layer by spin coating technique as well distributed film. In order to keep costs low, aluminum was chosen as the cathode material. The Al/p-type Si and Al/perovskite/p-type Si devices have exhibited good rectifying properties and calculated rectifying ratio of the devices are 2.39 x 10(3) and 4.56 x 10(4) at 1 V, respectively. Photodiode properties of the device have been illustrated and discussed in the details by calculating some diode parameters. While the Al/p-type Si device has 1.53 ideality factor value and 0.72 eV barrier height, the ideality factor and barrier height values of Al/perovskite/p-type Si device have been obtained as 2.12 and 0.87 eV, respectively under dark condition. The solar cell efficiency and fill factor values of the Al/perovskite/p-type Si device are 7.44 x 10(-3) and 23.7, respectively. Such devices can find applications as rectifiers and photodiodes in industry.

J	Han, D; Zhang, T; Huang, ML; Sun, DY; Du, MH; Chen, SY				Han, Dan; Zhang, Tao; Huang, Menglin; Sun, Deyan; Du, Mao-Hua; Chen, Shiyou			Predicting the thermodynamic stability of double-perovskite halides from density functional theory	APL MATERIALS			English	Article							ELECTRONIC-PROPERTIES; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURES; SOLAR-CELLS; SEMICONDUCTORS; 1ST-PRINCIPLES; CH3NH3PBI3; PHASES; SILVER; AGBR; AGCL	Recently, a series of double-perovskite halide compounds such as Cs2AgBiCl6 and Cs2AgBiBr6 have attracted intensive interest as promising alternatives to the solar absorber material CH3NH3PbI3 because they are Pb-free and may exhibit enhanced stability. The thermodynamic stability of a number of double-perovskite halides has been predicted based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations of compound formation energies. In this paper, we found that the stability prediction can be dependent on the approximations used for the exchange-correlation functionals, e.g., the DFT calculations using the widely used Perdew, Burke, Ernzerhof (PBE) functional predict that Cs2AgBiBr6 is thermodynamically unstable against phase-separation into the competing phases such as AgBr, Cs2AgBr3, Cs3Bi2Br9, etc., obviously inconsistent with the good stability observed experimentally. The incorrect prediction by the PBE calculation results from its failure to predict the correct ground-state structures of AgBr, AgCl, and CsCl. By contrast, the DFT calculations based on local density approximation, optB86b-vdW, and optB88-vdW functionals predict the ground-state structures of these binary halides correctly. Furthermore, the optB88-vdW functional is found to give the most accurate description of the lattice constants of the doubleperovskite halides and their competing phases. Given these two aspects, we suggest that the optB88-vdW functional should be used for predicting thermodynamic stability in the future high-throughput computational material design or the construction of the Materials Genome database for new double-perovskite halides. Using different exchange-correlation functionals has little influence on the dispersion of the conduction and the valence bands near the electronic bandgap; however, the calculated bandgap can be affected indirectly by the optimized lattice constant, which varies for different functionals.

Long Carrier Lifetimes in PbI2-Rich Perovskites Rationalized by Ab Initio Nonadiabatic Molecular Dynamics	ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							ELECTRON-HOLE RECOMBINATION; METHYLAMMONIUM LEAD IODIDE; CURRENT-VOLTAGE HYSTERESIS; CH3NH3PBI3 PEROVSKITE; HYBRID PEROVSKITES; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; CHARGE SEPARATION; ORGANIC CATIONS; PYXAID PROGRAM; SOLAR-CELLS	Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites have attracted considerable interest due to their impressive performance in solar energy applications. Many experiments show that a slight excess of PbI2 significantly enhances the properties of the most studied CH3NH3PbI3 compound. We use real-time time-dependent density functional theory and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics to demonstrate that the effect arises due to decreased electron-phonon interactions responsible for nonradiative charge recombination. The fast organic CH3NH3+ (MA) cations, present on surfaces of stochiometric and MAI-rich perovskites, are particularly mobile and introduce high-frequency phonons and strong electric fields that couple to the charge carriers and create large nonadiabatic coupling. Excess PbI2 decreases MA surface coverage, reduces the nonadiabatic coupling by up to an order of magnitude, and extends the charge carrier lifetime. Generally, charges in perovskites are long-lived because the nonadiabatic coupling is very small, less than 1 meV, and quantum coherence formed during charge recombination is short, less than 10 fs. Our results rationalize why decreasing the concentration of the organic cations on perovskite surfaces can suppress nonradiative charge carrier recombination and improve material performance.

Influence of Bulky Organo-Ammonium Halide Additive Choice on the Flexibility and Efficiency of Perovskite Light-Emitting Devices	ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS			English	Article						flexible light-emitting diodes; metal halide perovskite; perovskite light-emitting diodes	CRACK ONSET STRAIN; SOLAR-CELLS; THIN-FILMS; DIODES; ENERGY	Perovskite light-emitting diodes (LEDs) require small grain sizes to spatially confine charge carriers for efficient radiative recombination. As grain size decreases, passivation of surface defects becomes increasingly important. Additionally, polycrystalline perovskite films are highly brittle and mechanically fragile, limiting their practical applications in flexible electronics. In this work, the introduction of properly chosen bulky organo-ammonium halide additives is shown to be able to improve both optoelectronic and mechanical properties of perovskites, yielding highly efficient, robust, and flexible perovskite LEDs with external quantum efficiency of up to 13% and no degradation after bending for 10 000 cycles at a radius of 2 mm. Furthermore, insight of the improvements regarding molecular structure, size, and polarity at the atomic level is obtained with first-principles calculations, and design principles are provided to overcome trade-offs between optoelectronic and mechanical properties, thus increasing the scope for future highly efficient, robust, and flexible perovskite electronic device development.

The most common type of J-V hysteresis in PSCs is normal hysteresis, in which the performance in the reverse scan is better than that in the forward scan. However, inverted hysteresis also exists, in which the reverse scan performance is worse than in the forward scan; this hysteresis, however, is significantly less well studied. In this work, we show that the hysteresis decreases when the sweep rate is decreased only in cases involving a small bias range, and it does not decrease with a large bias range. Under large forward bias and slowing sweep rate, we observe enhanced normal hysteresis or inverted hysteresis in PSCs. Moreover, the degree of normal and inverted hysteresis can be adjusted by varying the bias. Here, we hypothesize that the tunable hysteresis is derived from the different distribution of ionic defects (V-I and V-MA) at the electron (hole) transport layer/perovskite interface due to ionic movement in the perovskite layer under the different bias scanning conditions. This conclusion is confirmed using Kelvin probe force microscopy with different bias voltages and scanning rates, which shows surface potential hysteresis based on ionic-migration-related Fermi level shifting in perovskite films and agrees with the tunable J-V hysteresis hypothesis. Moreover, the increased time response in the milliseconds region in open-circuit voltage decay after J-V scanning further corroborates the mechanism of ionic migration under bias. Our work provides new insights into the ionic movement hypothesis for the J-V hysteresis in PSCs.

Here, we investigate the role of oxidized graphene when interfaced with the perovskite MAPbI. Using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory, we study the change in the structural and electronic properties of the heterostructures with the oxidation level. We show that, depending on the concentration of the epoxy functional groups, only reduced graphene oxide would be advantageous for the extraction of photogenerated charge carriers. For oxygen concentration up to 33%, both hole and electron carriers could be extracted, whereas for concentrations between 33 and 66%, electron transfer is favored. For concentrations above 66%, it should not be possible to extract carriers. Moreover, the analysis of the charge density rearrangement at the interface due to the oxidization of graphene shows that the interfacial dipole decreases with the increase in the oxygen content. Finally, we report the modification of the band gap and the work-function in the oxidized graphene for different rearrangements of the epoxy groups on the graphene sheet. This study shows that the reduced graphene oxide with specific oxidation levels could effectively be incorporated as a selective contact in heterojunction devices for applications in perovskite solar cells.

Air-Stable Direct Bandgap Perovskite Semiconductors: All-Inorganic Tin-Based Heteroleptic Halides A(x)SnCl(y)I(z) (A = Cs, Rb)	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; IODIDE PEROVSKITES; LEAD IODIDE; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; EFFICIENT; CRYSTAL; MANAGEMENT; EMISSION; GROWTH	Semiconducting halide perovskites are a class of materials with exciting photoelectronic properties. Compared to the widely studied hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites, the all-inorganic derivatives are less well understood even as they promise high inherent stability. Currently, such materials are limited due to the fact that there is a very narrow choice of inorganic cations that can stabilize the desirable perovskite structure. Herein we report on the synthesis and characterization of novel all-inorganic tin-based perovskites and perovskitoids that can be stabilized by the heteroleptic coordination of chloride and iodide anions, Cs2SnCl2I2 (1) and Cs2.38Rb1.62Sn3Cl8I2 (2), consist of two-dimensional (2D) layers of [SnCl4I2](4-) octahedra with different connectivity modes. Compound 1 is an n = 1 Ruddlesden-Popper type perovskite adopting the tetragonal archetype structure (I4/mmm space group; a = 5.5905(3) angstrom, c = 18.8982(13) angstrom), while compound 2 crystallizes as an orthorhombic modification (Cmcm space group; a = 5.6730(11) angstrom, b = 25.973(5) angstrom, c = 16.587(3) angstrom) with corrugated layers. The crystal chemistry changes drastically when Cs+ is replaced by the smaller Rb+ cation which leads to the isolation of the low dimensional compounds Rb3SnCl3I2 (3a), Rb3SnCl2.33I2.67 (3b) and Rb7Sn4.25Cl12I3.5 (4), thus illustrating the importance of the A-cation size in the formation of perovskites. The 2D perovskites show wide band gaps and relatively large resistivities, associated with their chemical stability against the oxidation of Sn2+. The chemical stability is coupled with remarkable electronic properties that derive from the perovskite structure. DFT calculations suggest that both compounds are direct band gap semiconductors with large bandwidths, consistently with the experimentally determined band gaps of E-g = 2.62 and 2.81 eV for 1 and 2, respectively. The combination of stability and favorable electronic structure in heteroleptic-halide perovskites presents a new direction toward the realization of functional devices made exclusively from inorganic perovskites.

Colloidal Nanocrystals as a Platform for Rapid Screening of Charge Trap Passivating Molecules for Metal Halide Perovskite Thin Films	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							LIGHT-EMITTING-DIODES; OPEN-CIRCUIT VOLTAGE; SOLAR-CELLS; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; HIGH-EFFICIENCY; SURFACE PASSIVATION; INTERFACIAL MODIFIERS; HIGHLY LUMINESCENT; HYBRID PEROVSKITES; DIFFUSION LENGTHS	Charge recombination at surface trap sites is a significant impediment to metal halide perovskite (MHP) thin film-based optoelectronic devices. To passivate the surface charge traps, chemical treatments with molecules that bind to the MHP thin film surfaces can be employed. However, the current approaches to test the trap passivation efficacy of molecules on thin film surface suffer from limited through-put and low statistical significance. Here, we demonstrate the use of colloidal MHP nanocrystals (NCs) as an experimental platform for high-throughput screening of charge trap passivating molecules for MHP thin films. Using CsPbX3 (X = Br, I) NCs, over 20 molecules were rapidly screened for their surface trap passivation efficacy. Our approach identified trinbutylphosphine (TBPh) as a superb charge trap passivating molecule on MHP surfaces. TBPh treatment brings the photoluminescence quantum yield of CsPbBr3 NCs to near unity and also results in superior surface trap passivation of MHP thin films, even when compared to a previously reported treatment with pyridine. Our work highlights the benefits of utilizing the high surface area-to-volume ratio of NCs for the accelerated study of surface trap passivation using molecular treatment and then translating the findings to bulk semiconductors. This approach is broadly applicable to a wide range of semiconductors as long as they can be synthesized into NCs.	[Alpert, Matthew R.; Niezgoda, J.

Electron microscopy characterization of the PVSK/ZnO interfaces are correlated with charge transfer properties, probed by means of temperature, power, and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The results show that at room temperature, the single crystalline ZnO film promotes PL quenching, and reduces recombination lifetime along with exciton density in the PVSK films, all indicative of efficient electron extraction. Nevertheless, the micro-structured ZnO layers exhibit a mild increase of the PVSK PL at room temperature, and the nano-structured ZnO enhances PL by up to several thousand-fold, while simultaneously enhancing recombination rates by 50%. These trends are temperature dependent, and the findings highlight two opposing aspects of how excitonic dissociation in PVSK thin films is affected by the morphology of the underlying ZnO layers. While the single crystalline ZnO can be leveraged as an efficient electron extraction layer for application in photovoltaic devices, the micro- and nano-structured ones offer potential new opportunities for utilization of high quantum yield hybrid perovskites in opto-electronic platforms.

High-efficiency solar cells with methylammonium lead halide perovskites have been successfully achieved within just a few years. The high-quality perovskite films have made a significant impact on the fabrication of efficient and stable hybrid perovskite solar cells. Morphology engineering has been recognized as an effective way to obtain highly crystalline and pinhole-free perovskite films with optimized grain sizes. Here, we summarize several methodologies of morphology engineering, consisting of additive engineering, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), solvent engineering, solvent annealing, thermal engineering, compositional engineering and humidity engineering. The highly crystallized perovskite layers prepared by using these techniques show a uniform surface morphology, resulting in enhanced photovoltaic efficiency and long-term stability of hybrid perovskite solar cells.

Photophysical Properties and Improved Stability of Organic-Inorganic Perovskite by Surface Passivation	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							LEAD IODIDE PEROVSKITE; ROOM-TEMPERATURE SYNTHESIS; CHARGE-CARRIER DYNAMICS; LIGHT-EMITTING-DIODES; SOLAR-CELLS; HIGHLY LUMINESCENT; QUANTUM DOTS; COLLOIDAL SYNTHESIS; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; ENHANCED PHOTOLUMINESCENCE	Organic-inorganic perovskite materials in the form of nanocrystals and thin films have received enormous attention recently because of their unique optoelectronic properties such as high absorption coefficient, narrow and tunable emission bandwidth, high photoluminescence quantum yield, long exciton lifetime, and balanced charge transport properties. These properties have found applications in a number of important fields, including photovoltaic solar cells, light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, sensors, and lasers. However, the stability of the materials and devices is strongly affected by several factors such as water moisture, light, oxygen, temperature, solvent, and other materials in contact such as metal oxides used in devices. Defects, particularly those related to surface states, play a critical role in the stability as well as the performance of the perovskites. Various surface modification and defect passivation strategies have been developed to enhance stability and improve performance. We review some recent progress in the development of synthetic approaches to produce high-quality nanostructured and bulk film perovskites with controlled properties and functionalities. We also highlight the degradation mechanism and surface passivation approaches to address the issue of instability. To help gain deeper fundamental insight into mechanisms behind degradation and surface passivation, relevant properties, including structural, optical, electronic, and dynamic, are discussed and illustrated with proposed models.

Although extensive efforts have been paid, thermal property, one of the most crucial parameters in conventional solid-state electronic devices, has rarely been studied for HPDs. Here, we investigate the temperature-dependent ultralow thermal conductivity and ultrahigh thermal expansion of single-crystalline MAPbX(3) (MA = CH3NH3), which are found distinct from traditional thin-film solar cells materials. Particularly, for MAPbI3, thermal conductivity is observed being only 0.3 Wm(-1).K-1 and linear thermal expansion coefficient along [100] direction is as high as 57.8 X 10(-6) K-1 (tetragonal) and much higher at the structural phase transition point. We attribute the ultralow thermal conductivity and ultrahigh thermal expansion to the weak chemical bonds associated with the soft perovskite materials. These unique properties can be very challenging for the multilayer device design, but their ultralow thermal conductivity may unveil a new thermoelectric material concept.

Through a combination of experimental validation and computational analysis, we show no evidence of the formation of the mixed sulfide and iodide perovskite phase, MASbSI(2) (MA = CH3NH3+), and instead that the main products are a mixture of the binary and ternary compounds (513253 and MA(3)Sb(2)I(9)). Density functional theory calculations also indicate that such a mixed sulfide and iodide perovskite phase should be thermodynamically less stable compared with binary/ternary anion-segregated secondary phases and less likely to be synthesized under equilibrium conditions. Additionally, band structure calculations show that this mixed sulfide and iodide phase, if possible to synthesize (e.g., under nonequilibrium conditions), should have a suitable direct band gap for photovoltaic application.

This progress has been achieved even though there is no generally accepted mechanism of the operation of these solar cells. Here we present a model based on bistable amphoteric native defects that accounts for all key characteristics of these photovoltaics and explains many idiosyncratic properties of halide perovskites. We show that a transformation between donor-like and acceptor-like configurations leads to a resonant interaction between amphoteric defects and free charge carriers. This interaction, combined with the charge transfer from the perovskite to the electron and hole transporting layers results in the formation of a dynamic n-i-p junction whose photovoltaic parameters are determined by the perovskite absorber. The model provides a unified explanation for the outstanding properties of the perovskite photovoltaics, including hysteresis of J-V characteristics and ultraviolet light-induced degradation.

Tunable Polaron Distortions Control the Extent of Halide Demixing in Lead Halide Perovskites	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article							INDUCED PHASE SEGREGATION; EXCITON BINDING-ENERGY; LIGHT-EMITTING-DIODES; TANDEM SOLAR-CELLS; HYBRID PEROVSKITES; THIN-FILMS; SINGLE-CRYSTALS; CATION-EXCHANGE; ION SEGREGATION; DIFFUSION	Photoinduced phase separation in mixed halide perovskites emerges from their electro-mechanical properties and high ionic conductivities, resulting in photoinduced I--rich charge carrier traps that diminish photovoltaic performance. Whether photoinduced phase separation stems from the polycrystalline microstructure or is an intrinsic material property has been an open question. We investigate the nanoscale photoinduced behavior of single-crystal mixed Br-/I- methylammonium (MA(+)) lead halide perovskite (MAPb(BrxI1-x)(3)) nanoplates, eliminating effects from extended structural defects. Even in these nanoplates, we find that phase separation occurs, resulting in I--rich clusters that are nucleated stochastically and stabilized by polarons. Upon lowering the electron-phonon coupling strength by partially exchanging MA(+) for Cs+, a phase-separated steady state is not reached, nevertheless transient I- clustering still occurs. Our results, supported by multiscale modeling, demonstrate that photoinduced phase separation is an intrinsic property of mixed halide perovskites, the extent and dynamics of which depends on the electron-phonon coupling strength.

These perovskites are being considered for possibly replacing the Pb-based organic-inorganic halide perovskites in state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells. While the recent effort in this area has led to certain progress, some scientific and technological issues still remain unresolved. Here we provide perspectives on the comprehensive understanding of perovskite toxicity/instability, followed by design strategies for new nontoxic, stable perovskites. We also envision unprecedented challenges in the processing of the promising candidate perovskites that bridges materials design and actual devices. Future research in these directions will open up new possibilities in realizing eco-friendly and stable perovskite PVs for real-world applications.

In situ characterizations were carried out to provide a comprehensive picture of structural evolution and crystal growth mechanisms. These findings present opportunities for designing an effective process for blade-coating perovskite film: a large-grained dense perovskite film with high crystal quality and photophysical properties can be obtained only via direct crystallization for both spin-coating and blade-coating processes. As a result, the blade-coated MAPbI(3) films deliver excellent charge-collection efficiency at both short circuit and open circuit, and photovoltaic properties with efficiencies of 18.74% (0.09 cm(2)) and 17.06% (1 cm(2)) in planar solar cells. The significant advances in understanding how the phase transition links spin-coating and blade-coating processes should provide a path toward high-performance printed perovskite devices.

The electrophoretic deposition of PbSO4-oleate-capped CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) nanocrystals suspended in hexane solution on mesoscopic TiO2 films allows the design of controlled architecture with single or multiple layers of perovskite films. The hierarchy in the assembly of these nanocrystals is seen first through the linearly organized nanocrystals in hexane followed by the deposition of larger linear rods similar to 500 nm in length. Since most of the photophysical properties of nanocrystals are retained in these aligned arrays, we can design films with tunable luminescence including white color. The electrophoretic deposition of layered films of perovskites in a controlled fashion opens up new ways to design tandem perovskite solar cells and tunable display devices.

Slow thermal equilibration in methylammonium lead iodide revealed by transient mid-infrared spectroscopy	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							PEROVSKITE SOLAR-CELLS; GENERALIZED GRADIENT APPROXIMATION; AUGMENTED-WAVE METHOD; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; HYBRID PEROVSKITES; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; SINGLE-CRYSTALS; CH3NH3PBI3; TEMPERATURE; EXCHANGE	Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites are emerging semiconductors for cheap and efficient photovoltaics and light-emitting devices. Different from conventional inorganic semi-conductors, hybrid perovskites consist of coexisting organic and inorganic sub-lattices, which present disparate atomic masses and bond strengths. The nanoscopic interpenetration of these disparate components, which lack strong electronic and vibrational coupling, presents fundamental challenges to the understanding of charge and heat dissipation. Here we study phonon population and equilibration processes in methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)) by transiently probing the vibrational modes of the organic sub-lattice following above-bandgap optical excitation. We observe inter-sub-lattice thermal equilibration on timescales ranging from hundreds of picoseconds to a couple of nanoseconds. As supported by a two-temperature model based on first-principles calculations, the slow thermal equilibration is attributable to the sequential phonon populations of the inorganic and organic sub-lattices, respectively. The observed long-lasting thermal non-equilibrium offers insights into thermal transport and heat management of the emergent hybrid material class.

It is still a challenge to obtain PSCs with good thermal stability and high permanence, especially at extreme outdoor temperatures. This work systematically studies the effects of Bi3+ modification on structural, electrical, and optical properties of perovskite films (FA(0.83)MA(0.17)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)(3)) and the performance of corresponding PSCs. The results indicate that Bi3+ modified PSCs can achieve better thermal stability, photovoltaic response, and reproducibility compared with control cells due to the decreased grain boundaries, enhanced crystallization, and improved electron extraction from perovskite film. As a result, the modified PSC exhibits an optimized power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.4% compared with 18.3% for the optimized control device, accompanied by better thermoresistant ability under 100-180 degrees C and enhanced long-term stability. The degradation rate of the modified device is reduced by an order of magnitude due to effective structural defect modification in perovskite photoactive layer. It could maintain more than two months at 60 degrees C.

The novel Mn-doped all-inorganic perovskites, CsPb1-xMnxI1+2xBr2-2x, are prepared in ambient atmosphere. As the concentration of Mn2+ ions increases, the bandgaps of CsPb1-xMnxI1+2xBr2-2x decrease from 1.89 to 1.75 eV. Additionally, when the concentration of Mn dopants is appropriate, this novel Mn-doped all-inorganic perovskite film shows better crystallinity and morphology than its undoped counterpart. These advantages alleviate the energy loss in hole transfer and facilitate the charge-transfer in perovskites, therefore, PSCs based on these novel CsPb1-xMnxI1+2xBr2-2x perovskite films display better photovoltaic performance than the undoped CsPbIBr2 perovskite films. The reference CsPbIBr2 cell reaches a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.14%, comparable with the previous reports. The CsPb1-xMnxI1+2xBr2-2x cells reach the highest PCE of 7.36% (when x= 0.005), an increase of 19.9% in PCE. Furthermore, the encapsulated CsPb0.995Mn0.005I1.01Br1.99 cells exhibit good stability in ambient atmosphere. The storage stability measurements on the encapsulated PSCs reveal that PCE is dropped by only 8% of the initial value after >300 h in ambient. Such improved efficiency and stability are achieved using low-cost carbon electrodes (without expensive hole transport materials and Au electrodes).

Using lead chalcogenide nanocrystals as spin mixers: a perspective on near-infrared-to-visible upconversion	DALTON TRANSACTIONS			English	Review							SOLAR-CELLS; ENERGY-TRANSFER; QUANTUM DOTS; TRIPLET EXCITONS; PEROVSKITE; SOLIDS; GENERATION; PENTACENE; TRIHALIDE; SYSTEMS	The process of upconversion leads to emission of photons higher in energy than the incident photons. Near-infrared-to-visible upconversion, in particular, shows promise in sub-bandgap sensitization of silicon and other optoelectronic materials, resulting in potential applications ranging from photovoltaics that exceed the Shockley-Queisser limit to infrared imaging. A feasible mechanism for near-infraredto- visible upconversion is triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) sensitized by colloidal nanocrystals (NCs). Here, the long lifetime of spin-triplet excitons in the organic materials that undergo TTA makes upconversion possible under incoherent excitation at relatively low photon fluxes. Since this process relies on optically inactive triplet states, semiconductor NCs are utilized as efficient spin mixers, absorbing the incident light and sensitizing the triplet states of the TTA material. The state-of-the-art system uses rubrene with a triplet energy of 1.14 eV as the TTA medium, and thus allows upconversion of light with photon energies above similar to 1.1 eV. In this perspective, we review the field of lead sulfide (PbS) NC-sensitized near-infraredto- visible upconversion, discuss solution-based upconversion, and highlight progress made on solid-state upconversion devices.

Stability and reliability requirements addressed in this paper cover light management, mechanical characteristics, chemical compatibility, form factors, and durability. While flexible organic electronic devices have already been demonstrated and commercialized, so far only prototypes of ultra-thin and stretchable devices have been demonstrated.

However, the composition effect on thermal stability and photovoltaic performances has not yet been comprehensively investigated. Therefore, the interplay between composition, crystal structure, morphology, and optoelectronic properties under heat stress, is systematically elucidated here through a series of in situ characterizations. It is revealed for the first time that the FA(+) and Br- release synchronously at first even under mild annealing. This leads to a serious FA- and Br-deficiency issue, with only 88.3% of Br and 90.2% of FA retained after annealing at 100 degrees C, which significantly magnifies the hysteresis, phase segregation, and instability issues. Finally, a trace amount of FA(+) and Br- is introduced onto the post-annealed MLMP surface to compensate for the deficiency through vacancy filling. The degradation lifetime to 80% of the initial efficiency (t(80)) is improved from 504 to 1056 h and the hysteresis issue is also well resolved. This work highlights the importance of the synergetic composition effect of the organic cation and halide anion on stability and efficiency optimization for long-term applications.

In general, PSC employs a perovskite absorber material sandwiched between an electron and hole selective transport layer optimized with respect to optimal band alignment, efficient charge collection, and low interfacial recombination. The interfaces between the perovskite absorber and respective selective contacts play a crucial role in determining photovoltaic performance and stability of PSCs. However, a fundamental understanding is lacking, and there is poor understanding in controlling the physical processes at the interfaces. Herein, we investigate the interfacial characteristics of PSCs with both planar and mesoporous architecture that provide a deeper insight into the charge recombination and accumulation mechanism and the origin of open-circuit voltage (V-oc). The effect of electron-and hole-selective contacts in the final cell performance of PSCs has been analyzed by impedance spectroscopy and capacitance-frequency analysis. This study demonstrates that the excess of charge accumulation under illumination in planar-based devices is responsible for the origin of V-oc and hysteresis phenomena.

In only a few years, an unprecedented progression of preparation procedures and material compositions delivered lab-scale devices that have now reached record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) higher than 20%, competing with most established solar cell materials such as silicon, CIGS, and CdTe. However, despite a large number of researchers currently involved in this topic, only a few groups in the world can reproduce >20% efficiencies on a regular n-i-p architecture. In this work, we present detailed protocols for preparing PSCs in regular (n-i-p) and inverted (p-i-n) architectures with >= 20% PCE. We aim to provide a comprehensive, reproducible description of our device fabrication , protocols. We encourage the practice of reporting detailed and transparent protocols that can be more easily reproduced by other laboratories. A better reporting standard may, in turn, accelerate the development of perovskite solar cells and related research fields.

However, its short layer distance and strong binding energy make it challenging to prepare high-quality large 2D antimonene; therefore, its predicted tunable band gap has not been experimentally confirmed. Now, an approach to prepare smooth and large 2D antimonene with uniform layers that uses a pregrinding and subsequent sonication-assisted liquid-phase exfoliation process has been established. Mortar pregrinding provides a shear force along the layer surfaces, forming large, thin antimony plates, which can then easily be exfoliated into smooth, large antimonene, avoiding long sonication times and antimonene destruction. The resulting antimonene also enabled verification of the tunable band gap from 0.8 eV to 1.44 eV. Hole extraction and current enhancement by about 30% occurred when the antimonene was used as a hole transport layer in perovskite solar cells.

Zero-dimensional Cs4EuX6 (X = Br, I) all-inorganic perovskite single crystals for gamma-ray spectroscopy	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							LIGHT-EMITTING-DIODES; SOLAR-CELLS; SCINTILLATION PROPERTIES; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; BROMIDE; GROWTH; PERFORMANCE; CSPBX3; YIELD; CE3+	Organic-inorganic and all-inorganic halide perovskites have become leading candidates toward high-performance optoelectronic devices and radiation detectors. In this work, we report novel zero-dimensional Cs4EuX6 (X = Br, I) perovskite single crystals as self-activated scintillators with superior performance for gamma-ray spectroscopy. Both Cs4EuBr6 and Cs4EuI6 single crystals grown by the Bridgman method were determined to have the trigonal crystal structure with the R3c space group, and have a melting point of approximately 540 degrees C. Cs4EuBr6 and Cs4EuI6 exhibit blue emission under UV excitation and high light yields of 78000 +/- 4000 photons per MeV and 53000 +/- 3000 photons per MeV under Cs-137 gamma-ray irradiation, respectively. In particular, the former represents the best result achieved for self-activated scintillators thus far. Thermally stimulated luminescence studies and density functional theory calculations elucidate the correlation between halogen vacancies and long-lived emission (afterglow) at room temperature in Cs4EuX6 (X = Br, I) single crystals. Our findings not only demonstrate the high gamma-ray detection efficiency in Cs4EuX6 (X = Br, I), but will further promote the development of 0D metal halide-based novel luminescent and radiation detection materials.

Identifying molecular materials that achieve this purpose is a key target of current research efforts. Here, adamantane (AD) and 1-adamantylamine (ADA) are introduced as molecular modulators to abate electronic defects present within the bulk and at the perovskite-hole conductor interface. To this effect, the modulator is added either into the antisolvent (AS) to precipitate it together with the perovskite (AS method) or they are spin coated (SC) onto its surface (SC method). Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements show substantially longer lifetimes for perovskite films treated with AD and ADA compared to the reference sample. In line with this observation, it is found that the presence of AD and ADA molecules at the interface between the perovskite film and the hole conductor increases all photovoltaic metrics, in particular the open circuit photovoltage (V-oc) as well as the operational stability of the PSC.

By using this novel approach for perovskite materials, we could directly obtain complete band alignment to vacuum of both CH3NH3PbBr3 nanocrystals and the ligands widely used in their preparation. We discuss the possible influence of the ligand molecules to apparent perovskite properties, and we compare the electronic properties of nanocrystals to those of bulk material. The experimental results were supported by DFT calculations.

Herein, a general strategy of solution engineering has been implemented to enable a wide solution-processing window for high V-oc (similar to 1.3 V) and power conversion efficiency (PCE, similar to 12.5%). We introduce a nontoxic solvent of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and an assisted heating process in the fabrication of CsPbI2Br (CPI2) to control the improved crystallization. A wide solution-processing window including a wide range of solvent components and solute concentrations has been realized. The CPI2-based inorganic perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) exhibit a high PCE up to 12.52%. More importantly, these devices demonstrate a remarkable V-oc of 1.315 V. The performance has possessed such a region with high V-oc and PCE in all Cs-based IPSCs, unveiling wide solution-processing windows with enhanced solution processability facilitating potential industrial application especially for tandem solar cells.

Photoluminescence and Photoconductivity to Assess Maximum Open-Circuit Voltage and Carrier Transport in Hybrid Perovskites and Other Photovoltaic Materials	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article							TANDEM SOLAR-CELLS; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; DIFFUSION LENGTHS; PERFORMANCE; EFFICIENCY; LIFETIMES; PASSIVATION; STABILITY; MAPBI(3); YIELDS	Photovoltaic (PV) device development is much more expensive and time-consuming than the development of the absorber layer alone. This Perspective focuses on two methods that can be used to rapidly assess and develop PV absorber materials independent of device development. The absorber material properties of quasi-Fermi level splitting and carrier diffusion length under steady effective 1 Sun illumination are indicators of a material's ability to achieve high V-OC and J(SC) . These two material properties can be rapidly and simultaneously assessed with steady-state absolute intensity photoluminescence and photoconductivity measurements. As a result, these methods are extremely useful for predicting the quality and stability of PV materials prior to PV device development. Here, we summarize the methods, discuss their strengths and weaknesses, and compare photoluminescence and photoconductivity results with device performance for four hybrid perovskite compositions of various bandgaps (1.35-1.82 eV), CISe, CIGSe, and CZTSe.

The size control of nanocrystals was achieved through varying ligand and solute concentrations, which resulted in a tunable band gap and emission spectrum. The growth mechanism as well as the effect of ligand concentration on the structural and optical properties were studied in detail. The excitation spectra extended from the blue to UV region. This indicates that these perovskites are promising photon down conversion materials, which can combine with III-nitride UV/blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to emit white light. This work may bring III-nitride-based white LEDs one step closer to widespread adoption in general illumination market because the large emission range that has been produced with the ligand-assisted reprecipitation process is an important milestone in the path to justifying commercialization.

Here a solution-processed photodetector based on the triple cation perovskite is demonstrated. The perovskite photodetectors show a high detectivity, high speed, as well as excellent environmental stability. Operating at a low voltage bias of 2 V, the photodetectors exhibit a large on/off ratio of 10(5), high specific detectivity of approximate to 10(13) Jones, and a fast photoresponse with 3 dB bandwidth up to 0.82 MHz. Further analysis demonstrates that such performance originates from the modulated Schottky barrier height by illumination. The barrier suppresses dark current without any illumination, but it can be effectively lowered under illumination, thus resulting in a more efficient charge extraction and collection. The results demonstrate a great potential of triple cation perovskite in photodetection and provide a route to achieve high performance devices.

PCBM brings tremendous challenges in upscaling of PeSCs using industry-relevant methods due to its aggregation behavior, which undermines the power conversion efficiency and stability. Herein, we highlight these, seldom reported, challenges with PCBM. Furthermore, we investigate the potential of nonfullerene indacenodithiophene (IDT)-based molecules by employing a commercially available variant, 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylpheny1)-dithieno[2,3-d:2',3'-d']-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b'] dithiophene (ITIC), as a PCBM replacement in ambient-processed PeSCs. Films fabrication by laboratory-based spin-coating and industry-relevant slot-die coating methods are compared. Although similar power-conversion efficiencies are achieved with both types of ETL in a simple device structure fabricated by spin-coating, the nanofibriller morphology of ITIC compared to the aggregated morphology of PCBM films enables improved mechanical integrity and stability of ITIC devices. Upon slot-die coating, the aggregation of PCBM is exacerbated, leading to significantly lower power-conversion efficiency of devices than spin-coated PCBM as well as slot-diecoated ITIC devices. Our results clearly indicate that IDT-based molecules have great potential as an ETL in PeSCs, offering superior properties and upscaling compatibility than PCBM. Thus, we present a short summary of recently emerged nonfullerene IDT-based molecules from the field of organic solar cells and discuss their scope in PeSCs as electron or hole-transport layer.

Diammonium Cations in the FASnI(3) Perovskite Structure Lead to Lower Dark Currents and More Efficient Solar Cells	ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							TIN HALIDE PEROVSKITES; BLOCKING LAYER; ABSORBER; FILMS; 2D	Hybrid halide perovskite solar cells with mixed cations demonstrate superior optical and electrical properties, especially for lead-based perovskite devices. Here, we report lead-free tin-based perovskite solar cells with diammonium cations, which can significantly improve the device performance. Formamidinium tin iodide (FASnI(3)) perovskite can incorporate propylenediammonium (PN) and trimethylenediammonium (TN) and retain its three-dimensional structure while at the same time providing better film morphology and optoelectronic properties. As a result, solar cell devices using FASnI(3) absorbers mixed with 10% PN and 10% TN achieve higher power conversion efficiencies of 5.85% and 5.53%, respectively, compared to 2.53% of the pristine FASnI(3) solar cell. This difference in device performance can be mainly attributed to the reduced leakage current, lower trap-state density, and reduced recombination, as evidenced by our dark current voltage, current, and impedance measurements. The results suggest that perovskite absorbers with mixed diammonium cations are beneficial in achieving high-performance perovskite solar cells.

Spontaneous Silver Doping and Surface Passivation of CsPbl(3) Perovskite Active Layer Enable Light-Emitting Devices with an External Quantum Efficiency of 11.2%	ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; SOLAR-CELLS; CSPBX3 X; NANOCRYSTALS; DIODES; STABILITY; PERFORMANCE; DOTS; BR; EMISSION	Lead halide perovskite nanocrystals are currently under intense investigation as components of solution-processed light emitting devices (LEDs). We demonstrate LEDs based on Ag doped passivated CsPbI3 perovskite nanocrystals with external quantum efficiency of 11.2% and an improved stability. Ag and trilayer MoO3/Au/MoO3 structure were used as cathode and anode, respectively, which reduce the electron injection barrier and ensure the high transparency and low resistance of the anode. Silver ions diffuse into perovskite film from the Ag electrode, as confirmed by the elemental mapping, the presence of Ag 3d peaks in the X-ray photoelectron spectrum, and the peak shift in the X-ray diffraction patterns of CsPbI3. In addition to doping, silver ions play the beneficial role of passivating surface defect states of CsPbI3 nanocrystals, which results in increased photoluminescence quantum yield, elongated emission lifetime, and improved stability of perovskite films.

In particular, a nanostructured interface (e.g., a core shell nanowire) between two semiconductors leads to a short charge separation distance, such that photoexcited charge carriers can be more quickly and efficiently collected. While vapor-phase growth methods are used to synthesize uniform core-shell nanowire arrays of semiconductors such as Si and InP, more general strategies are required to produce related structures composed of a broader range of materials. Herein, we employ anodic aluminum oxide templates to synthesize CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite core copper thiocyanate shell nanowire arrays employing a combination of electrodeposition and solution casting methods. Using scanning electron microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, we confirm the target structure and show that adopting a core shell nanowire architecture accelerates the rate of charge quenching by nearly 3 orders of magnitude compared to samples with only an axial junction. Subsequently, we fit decay curves to a triexponential function to attribute fast quenching in core-shell nanowires to charge extraction by the copper thiocyanate nanotubes, as opposed to recombination within the perovskite nanowires. Dramatic improvements to charge extraction speed and efficiency result from the substantially reduced charge separation distance and increased interfacial area achieved via the core shell nanowire array architecture.

J	Li, W; Jacobs, R; Morgan, D				Li, Wei; Jacobs, Ryan; Morgan, Dane			Predicting the thermodynamic stability of perovskite oxides using machine learning models	COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article						Perovskite oxides; Thermodynamic stability; Materials discovery; Machine learning; Density Functional Theory		Perovskite materials have become ubiquitous in many technologically relevant applications, ranging from catalysts in solid oxide fuel cells to light absorbing layers in solar photovoltaics. The thermodynamic phase stability is a key parameter that broadly governs whether the material is expected to be synthesizable, and whether it may degrade under certain operating conditions. Phase stability can be calculated using Density Functional Theory (DFT), but the significant computational cost makes such calculation potentially prohibitive when screening large numbers of possible compounds. In this work, we developed machine learning models to predict the thermodynamic phase stability of perovskite oxides using a dataset of more than 1900 DFT-calculated perovskite oxide energies. The phase stability was determined using convex hull analysis, with the energy above the convex hull (Ehull) providing a direct measure of the stability. We generated a set of 791 features based on elemental property data to correlate with the Ehull value of each perovskite compound, and found through feature selection that the top 70 features were sufficient to produce the most accurate models without significant overfitting. For classification, the extra trees algorithm achieved the best prediction accuracy of 0.93 (+/- 0.02), with an F-1 score of 0.88 (+/- 0.03). For regression, leave-out 20% cross-validation tests with kernel ridge regression achieved the minimal root mean square error (RMSE) of 28.5 (+/- 7.5) meV/atom between cross-validation predicted Ehull values and DFT calculations, with the mean absolute error (MAE) in cross-validation energies of 16.7 (+/- 2.3) meV/atom. This error is within the range of errors in DFT formation energies relative to elemental reference states when compared to experiments and therefore may be considered sufficiently accurate to use in place of full DFT calculations. We further validated our model by predicting the stability of compounds not present in the training set and demonstrated our machine learning models are a fast and effective means of obtaining qualitatively useful guidance for a wide-range of perovskite oxide stability, potentially impacting materials design choices in a variety of technological applications.

However, in most publications, solar cells were fabricated in a highly controlled environment (glove boxes). To reduce the production cost, it is suggested to fabricate PSCs under ambient air conditions; however, some of the materials are highly sensitive to the humidity of ambient air conditions. Lithium bis(trifiuoromethanesulfonyl)-imide (LiTFSI) is one of these materials that usually is used as a dopant in hole-conductor solutions. In this paper, we have studied the performance of PSCs fabricated under ambient air conditions without using LiTFSI in hole transport material (HTM) solutions. This means we have stored the materials, prepared the solutions, and fabricated the devices all under ambient air conditions. In this work, spin-coating speed for deposition of the HTM layer, HTM solution preparation, the effect of HTM exposure to air and light, and the repetitive measurement of cells are investigated. We found that exposure of samples to air and light is both crucial for fabrication of solar cells with larger current density and better fill factor. These results are important toward fabrication of low-cast high-efficiency PSCs under ambient air conditions.

Nevertheless, due to the weak interaction between polar CH3NH3+ (MA(+)) and inorganic PbI3- sublattices, CH3NH3PbI3 dramatically suffers from poor moisture stability, thermal decomposition and device hysteresis. As such, strong electrostatic interactions between cations and anionic frameworks are desired for synergistic improvements of the abovementioned issues. While replacements of I- with Br- and/or Cl- evidently widen optical bandgaps of perovskite materials, compositional modifications can solely be applied on cation components in order to preserve the broad absorption of solar spectrum. Herein, we review the current successful practices in achieving efficient, stable and minimally hysteretic PSCs with lead iodide perovskite systems that employ photoactive cesium lead iodide (CsPbI3), formamidinium lead iodide (HC(NH2)(2)PbI3, or FAPbI(3)), MA(1-x-y-z) FA(x)Cs(y)Rb(z)PbI(3) mixed-cation settings as well as two-dimensional butylammonium (C4H9NH3+, or BA(+))/MA(+), polymeric ammonium (PEI+)/MA(+) co-cation layered structures. Fundamental aspects behind the stabilization of perovskite phases alpha-CsPbI 3, alpha-FAPbI(3), mixed-cation MA(1-x-y-z) FA(x)Cs(y)Rb(z)PbI(3) and crystallographic alignment of (BA)(2)(MA)(3)Pb4I13 for effective light absorption and charge transport will be discussed.

Efficient p-i-n inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite solar cell deposited using layer-by-layer vacuum deposition	JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY A			English	Article							HALIDE PEROVSKITES; STABILITY; PERFORMANCE; PROGRESS	Organometallic halide perovskites have emerged as a promising photovoltaic material achieving more than 22% power conversion efficiency. However, poor thermal, environmental, and photostability still plague methyl ammonium based perovskites. Replacing the organic cation with an inorganic cation: Cesium (Cs) is an alternative approach for making thermally stable perovskite solar cells where there is no organic molecule to decompose thermally. In this paper, the authors report on a CsPbI3 perovskite solar cell deposited using a layer-by-layer vacuum deposition technique followed by thermal annealing at 320 degrees C. A (p type-intrinsic-n type) (p-i-n) device architecture of ITO/polytriaryl amine/CsPbI3/phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester/Al with power conversion efficiency of >10% was achieved by carefully controlling the molar ratios of CsI to PbI2 and the substrate temperature during deposition. The bandgap of the material was 1.74 eV, and the doping density was 2 x 10(15)/cm(3). Published by the AVS.

However, compositional diversity of multi-component perovskites is significantly hampered due to the poor solubility of other cesium halides in these solvents. Here, we show how insoluble CsCl, as a new source of cesium cation, can be integrated into a multiple-cation perovskite material by a one-step method involving grinding of the precursors. The resulting polycrystalline powder is fully soluble in a DMSO/DMF mixture and allows formation of perovskite thin films. Cs-133 solid-state MAS NMR data indicate that the cesium cation is almost fully (90%) incorporated into the 3D perovskite lattice, while the remaining 10% forms a cesium-rich mixed-halide secondary phase. The planar heterojunction device fabricated using this original mechanoperovskite yielded a power conversion efficiency of 19.12% and an open circuit voltage of 1.16 V. Moreover, we show that the introduction of CsCl improves both interfacial and bulk photovoltaic metrics. Our one-step approach provides an efficient general method for incorporating poorly soluble salts into multi-component perovskite crystal lattices.

However, the presence of thermally activated carriers in the materials leads to high noise levels, which limits their photodetection capabilities. Here, we show that ultrasensitive photodetectors can be created from single-crystalline nanowire arrays of layered metal-halide perovskites. A series of nanowires was fabricated in which layer-by-layer self-organization of insulating organic cations and conductive inorganic frameworks, along the nanowire length, creates high resistance in the interior of the crystals and high conductivity at the edges of the crystals. Using these structures, high-performance photodetection was achieved with responsivities exceeding 1.5 x 10(4) A W-1 and detectivities exceeding 7 x 10(15) jones. Our state-of-the-art device performance originates from a combination of efficient free-carrier edge conduction and resistive hopping barriers in the layered perovskites.

So far, complex fluid dynamics have limited the solution deposition of uniform pinhole-free organic-inorganic perovskite thin films over large areas. Here, we show that very small amounts (tens of parts per million) of surfactants (for example, L-alpha-Phosphatidylcholine) dramatically alter the fluid drying dynamics and increase the adhesion of the perovskite ink to the underlying non-wetting charge transport layer. The additives enable blading of smooth perovskite films at a coating rate of 180 m h(-1) with root-mean-square roughness of 14.5 nm over 1 cm. The surfactants also passivate charge traps, resulting in efficiencies over 20% for small-area solar cells. Fast blading in air of perovskite films results in stabilized module efficiencies of 15.3% and 14.6% measured at aperture areas of 33.0 cm(2) and 57.2 cm(2), respectively.

Power conversion efficiency of 13.09% (AM1.5G, 100 mW/cm(2)) was obtained, which was comparable to those using ZrO2 as the blocking layer. Besides that, prolonged stability has been obtained. After being stored at ambient air for 104 days (relative humidity between 50% and 70%), 94.19% of the starting efficiency was preserved for devices without any encapsulation. Moreover, effect of thickness of SiO2 blocking layer on device performance was studied by tuning the concentration of SiO2 paste. A moderate concentrate was found to be beneficial to device performance. Without blocking layer, poor performance was observed due to short cutting between top electrode and bottom electron-transport-layer; when concentration of SiO2 paste is relative higher (which corresponded to relatively thicker films), cracks appeared which caused short-cuffing. Finally, due to the relative higher preservation of Si element (more than 1000 times of Zr) in earth, applying SiO2 as blocking layer could further lower down the cost of the carbon based hole-conductor-free mesoscopic perovskite solar cells.

The first layer was constructed by hydrothermal derived SnO2 nanoparticles, and the second layer was in-situ formed from hydrolysis and oxidization of SnCl2. It was observed that the two-step formed SnO2 layers could efficiently improve the device performance of the flexible perovskite solar cells. Without such layers, no photovoltaic effect was observed due to poor wettability of substrate. After SnO2 was deposited, power conversion begins due to improved crystallinity of perovskite layer. Compared with one-step processed SnO2 layer, the two-step processed SnO2 layers could take the advantages of accelerated charge extraction, lowered contact resistance, as well as reduced charge recombination, which help to upgrade open circuit voltage, short circuit current, fill factor and power conversion efficiency of the flexible devices. Device efficiency of 15.21% (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW/cm(2)) was obtained for the flexible devices, with prolonged shelf-stability in addition. After being stored in dark for 111 days (relative humidity of 35-55%, no encapsulation was used), device could keep 85% of starting efficiency. Meanwhile, specific power (ratio between power and device weight) of 0.87 kW/kg was obtained, as well as sound fatigue ability against bending. The solution based two-step formation process thus provides a reliable strategy for future application of flexible perovskite solar cells.

Efficient Photon Recycling and Radiation Trapping in Cesium Lead Halide Perovskite Waveguides	ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							LIGHT-EMITTING-DIODES; SOLAR-CELLS; SINGLE-CRYSTALS; CH3NH3PBI3 PEROVSKITE; DIFFUSION LENGTHS; NANOWIRES; NANOCRYSTALS; LIFETIME; GAAS; CSPBX3	Cesium lead halide perovskite materials have attracted considerable attention for potential applications in lasers, light-emitting diodes, and photo detectors. Here, we provide the experimental and theoretical evidence for photon recycling in CsPbBr3 perovskite microwires. Using two-photon excitation, we recorded photoluminescence (PL) lifetimes and emission spectra as a function of the lateral distance between PL excitation and collection positions along the microwire, with separations exceeding 100 pm. At longer separations, the PL spectrum develops a red-shifted emission peak accompanied by an appearance of well-resolved rise times in the PL kinetics. We developed quantitative modeling that accounts for bimolecular recombination and photon recycling within the microwire waveguide and is sufficient to account for the observed decay modifications. It relies on a high radiative efficiency in CsPbBr3 perovskite microwires and provides crucial information about the potential impact of photon recycling and waveguide trapping on optoelectronic properties of cesium lead halide perovskite materials.

Barrier Design to Prevent Metal-Induced Degradation and Improve Thermal Stability in Perovskite Solar Cells	ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							DIFFUSION-BARRIERS; TIN OXIDE; EFFICIENT; FORMAMIDINIUM; MANAGEMENT; INTERFACES; TOLERANCE; MIGRATION; LAYERS	Metal-contact-induced degradation and escape of volatile species from perovskite solar cells necessitate excellent diffusion barrier layers. We show that metal-induced degradation limits thermal stability in several perovskite chemistries with Au, Cu, and Ag gridlines even when the metal is separated from the perovskite by a layer of indium tin oxide (ITO). Channels in a sputtered ITO layer that align with perovskite grain boundaries are pathways for metal and halide diffusion into or out of the perovskite. Planarizing the perovskite morphology with a spin-cast organic charge transport layer results in a subsequently deposited ITO layer that is uniform and impermeable. We show that it is critical to seal the edges of the active layers to prevent escape of volatile species. We demonstrate 1000 h thermal stability at 85 degrees C in CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells with complete-coverage silver contacts. Our barrier layer design enables long-term thermal stability of perovskite solar cells, a critical step to commercialization.

N-Type Surface Doping of MAPbI(3) via Charge Transfer from Small Molecules	ADVANCED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS			English	Article						charge transfer; interface engineering; ohmic contacts; perovskite solar cells; surface doping; trap passivation	PEROVSKITE SOLAR-CELLS; LEAD HALIDE PEROVSKITES; NONRADIATIVE RECOMBINATION; PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS; FILMS; SEMICONDUCTORS; CH3NH3PBI3; PHOTOLUMINESCENCE; METHYLAMMONIUM; PERSPECTIVES	Organic hole and electron transport materials are regularly employed as electron- and hole-blocking layers in perovskite thin-film solar cells. In order to optimize charge extraction in the device, these organic layers can be doped using organic small molecules. However, to date there is little work carried out on direct doping of perovskite surfaces. In this report, the change in electrical properties of thin films of MAPbI(3) by surface doping the film with an organic dopant molecule: cobaltocene (Co(C5H5)(2)) is studied. By varying the quantity of cobaltocene deposited, the conductivity of MAPbI(3) thin films is observed to be tunable over several orders of magnitude. A tunable shift in the Fermi level illustrating that charge transfer doping enables control over the interfacial energy levels, is observed. An increase in photoconductivity is seen at intermediate doping levels, indicating passivation of surface traps confirmed by increased photoluminescence. This model system provides a means to understand more complex heterointerfaces of doped organic blends at perovskite surfaces.

Here, three highly stable methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbl(3)) perovskite films modified with polyethylenimines (PEls) of different molecular weights (Mw=600, Mw=10000 and Mw= 70000) were successfully obtained. The PEls were used as an additive in the perovskite to determine their influences on the structure, film quality, and performance of the perovskite. The perovskite films modified with PEls showed excellent stability, when studied over 20 days under ambient air conditions with a medial humidity of 60%. The results of XRD, UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence lifetime measurements showed that the PEI could not substitute for MA within the perovskite crystal lattice. The solar power conversion efficiency (PCE) eta of the pristine perovskite film and those modified with PEI (Mw=600), PEI (Mw=10000) and PEI (Mw=70000) were 9.69%, 6.84%, 6.43% and 6.94%, respectively. Even though the PCE is lower for the PEI-modified solar cells, their stability is substantially improved. The improved stability is attributed to PEI-H+ cations in the grain boundary of the perovskites, preventing them from direct contact with water molecules that otherwise cause fast degradation. This demonstrates that PEI modification is a simple and powerful strategy for stabilizing perovskite films.

In this paper, we realize the first two-terminal perovskite tandem with p-type silicon by developing a recombination contact that enables voltage addition without damaging either subcell. We find that silicon interhand recombination contacts are limited by a SiOx charge-extraction barrier, which forms during oxidative top-cell fabrication. A sputtered 30-nm indium tin oxide layer is found to protect the silicon cell surface from oxidation, while forming a recombination contact with the p-type nickel oxide hole transport layer for the perovskite top cell. Using this recombination contact we achieve voltage addition between the perovskite top cell and aluminum back-surface field p-type silicon bottom cell. We also find that minimizing moisture on the nickel oxide surface is important for achieving a stable open-circuit voltage under illumination. The recombination contact developed herein could play an important role in near-future developments.	[Hoye, Robert L.

Selective Cd Removal From CdTe for High-Efficiency Te Back-Contact Formation	IEEE JOURNAL OF PHOTOVOLTAICS			English	Article						Back contact; bifacial; CdTe; methylammonium iodide; perovskite; Schottky harrier; Te layer	CDS/CDTE SOLAR-CELLS; THIN-FILMS; PARAMETERS; BARRIER; DEVICE; CUXTE; LAYER	The presence of a Te-rich surface or an elemental Te layer is beneficial for the formation of a low-harrier hack contact for high-efficiency CdTe solar cells. Etching processes are widely used to form Te-rich CdTe surfaces, while deposition processes such as evaporation are used to form elemental Te layers. Here, we show that a reaction between methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I, MAI) and CdTe can be used to simply and controllably produce elemental Te over a wide processing window. Both X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy confirmed the formation of a Te layer. The MAI-produced Te layer reduces the Schottky barrier height, improves the open-circuit voltage (V-oc) and fill factor, and outperforms contacts formed with the evaporated Te. We examined the effect of MAI reaction temperature and the amount of Cu needed to optimize the device. CdS/CdTe stacks that were treated with a 125 mM MAI solution and heated to 125 degrees C for 10 min showed the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.1%, while the hest efficiency of a standard device without treatment was 13.0%, and the hest PCE of an evaporated Te layer was 13.8%. Notably, the improved efficiency for the MAI-treated devices was achieved with less Cu than was required for the standard device. With an indium tin oxide back electrode, the PCE was also improved from 11.0% to 12.2% with MAI treatment, providing a potential route for fabricating high-efficiency transparent or bifacial CdTe solar cells.

Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra revealed that the TiO2 NSs are more effective than TiO2 nanoparticles in accepting electrons from perovskite. Moreover, the TiO2 nanospindles further endowed the PSCs with good reproducibility and suppressed hysteresis. The best device with TiO2 NSs as ETMs yielded power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.6%, demonstrating that the home-made TiO2 NSs is a good ETM for PSCs.

The average efficiency of twenty devices with PEDOT:PSS-NH2-OH is increased to 14.16% from 10.67% with PEDOT:PSS, and the former devices exhibit good reproducibility with small standard deviations. Cyclic voltammetry results show that the highest occupied molecular orbital energy level of PEDOT:PSS-NH2-OH (5.32 eV) matches well with the valence band of CH3NH3PbI3 absorbers (5.4 eV). Photoluminescence measurements indicate that the CH3NH3PbI3 film deposited on PEDOT:PSS-NH2-OH has strong charge extraction capability than that on PEDOT:PSS. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results suggest that the photovoltaic devices exhibit efficient hole transport and excellent electron blocking employing PEDOT:PSS-NH2-OH as the hole transport layer, as well as have low series, contact resistance and large recombination resistance. The research demonstrates that the stable semiquinone and amine radical modified PEDOT:PSS can acts as an outstanding hole transport material for fabricating high-efficient perovskite solar cells.

Herein, based on density-functional theory computation, we show that lead-free tin (Sn) and germanium (Ge) based two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden-Popper hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites with a thickness of a few unit-cells, BA(2)MA(n-1)M(n)I(3n+1) (M = Sn or Ge, n = 2-4), possess desirable electronic, excitonic and light absorption properties, thereby showing promise for photovoltaic and/or photoelectronic applications. In particular, we show that by increasing the layer thickness of the Sn-based 2D perovskites, the bandgap can be lowered towards the optimal range (0.9-1.6 eV) for solar cells. Meanwhile, the exciton binding energy is reduced to a more optimal value. In addition, theoretical assessment indicates that the thermodynamic stability of Sn-/Ge-based 2D perovskites is notably enhanced compared to that of their 3D analogues. These features render the Sn-/Ge-based 2D hybrid perovskites with a thickness of a few tens of unit cells promising lead-free perovskites with much improved structural stabilities for photovoltaic and/or photoelectronic applications.

Spray coating of the PCBM electron transport layer significantly improves the efficiency of p-i-n planar perovskite solar cells	NANOSCALE			English	Article							ORGANIC-INORGANIC PEROVSKITES; PERFORMANCE; CH3NH3PBI3; POLYMER; ELIMINATION; HYSTERESIS	The p-i-n structure for perovskite solar cells has recently shown significant advantages in minimal hysteresis effects, and scalable manufacturing potential using low-temperature solution processing. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the perovskite p-i-n structure remains low mainly due to limitations using a flat electron transport layer (ETL). In this work, we demonstrate a new approach using spray coating to fabricate the [6,6]-phenyl-C(61)-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) ETL. By creating a rough surface, we effectively improve the light trapping properties inside the PCBM ETL. We reveal that the spray coated PCBM can form a cross-linked network, which may facilitate better charge transport and enhance extraction efficiency. By improving the contact between the perovskite film and the PCBM ETL, a reduction in the trap states is observed resulting in a PCE increase from 13% to >17%.

Excited-state vibrational dynamics toward the polaron in methylammonium lead iodide perovskite	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							HALIDE PEROVSKITE; SOLAR-CELLS; COHERENT; CH3NH3PBI3; RECOMBINATION; MECHANISMS; CARRIERS; LAYERS	Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites have attractive optoelectronic properties including exceptional solar cell performance. The improved properties of perovskites have been attributed to polaronic effects involving stabilization of localized charge character by structural deformations and polarizations. Here we examine the Pb-I structural dynamics leading to polaron formation in methylammonium lead iodide perovskite by transient absorption, time-domain Raman spectroscopy, and density functional theory. Methylammonium lead iodide perovskite exhibits excited-state coherent nuclear wave packets oscillating at similar to 20, similar to 43, and similar to 75 cm(-1) which involve skeletal bending, in-plane bending, and c-axis stretching of the I-Pb-I bonds, respectively. The amplitudes of these wave packet motions report on the magnitude of the excited-state structural changes, in particular, the formation of a bent and elongated octahedral PbI64- geometry. We have predicted the excited-state geometry and structural changes between the neutral and polaron states using a normal-mode projection method, which supports and rationalizes the experimental results. This study reveals the polaron formation via nuclear dynamics that may be important for efficient charge separation.

Interplay between Ion Transport, Applied Bias, and Degradation under Illumination in Hybrid Perovskite p-i-n Devices	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							METHYLAMMONIUM LEAD IODIDE; SOLAR-CELLS; ELECTRONIC CONDUCTIVITY; IMPEDANCE SPECTROSCOPY; ANOMALOUS HYSTERESIS; MIXED CONDUCTORS; POLARIZATION; MIGRATION; CAPACITANCE; DIFFUSION	We studied ion transport in hybrid organic inorganic perovskite p-i-n devices as a function of applied bias under device operating conditions. Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and equivalent circuit modeling, we elucidated various resistive and capacitive elements in the device. We show that ion migration is predictably influenced by a low applied forward bias, characterized by an increased capacitance at the hole-transporting (HTM) and electron transporting material (ETM) interfaces, as well as in bulk. However, unlike observations in n-i-p devices, we found that there is a capacitive discharge leading to ion redistribution in the bulk at high forward biases. Furthermore, we show that a chemical double-layer capacitance buildup as a result of ion accumulation impacts the electronic properties of the device, likely by inducing either charge pinning or charge screening, depending on the direction of the ion-induced field. Lastly, we extrapolate ion diffusion coefficients (similar to 10(-7) cm(2) s(-1)) and ionic conductivities (,similar to 10(-7) S cm(-1)) from the Warburg mass (ion) diffusion response and show that, as the device degrades, there is an overall depletion of capacitive effects coupled with increased ion mobility.

Nanoscale versions of these materials are also good candidates for light emitting devices. In this work, we synthesize perovskite nanocrystals using a surfactant-free method by introducing antimony iodide in the perovskite precursor. Surface-bound (CH3NH3)(3)Sb2I9 layers restrict the growth of CH3NH3PbI3, resulting in CH3NH3PbI3 nanocrystals of about 50 nm in size. Compared to the bulk perovskites, the nanocrystals show stronger photoluminescence. As there are no long-chain organic ligands on the surface that will inhibit the charge transport, these surfactant-free nanocrystals may have better performance in photoelectronic devices.

Overcoming Bulk Recombination Limits of Layered Perovskite Solar Cells with Mesoporous Substrates	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							LONG-TERM STABILITY; ANOMALOUS HYSTERESIS; TUNABLE PEROVSKITE; V HYSTERESIS; EFFICIENT; ENCAPSULATION; PERFORMANCE; ENHANCEMENT; DEGRADATION; TRIHALIDE	The synthesis and characterization of a lead iodide layered perovskite, [NH2C(I)=NH2](2)(CH3NH3)(2)Pb2I8, is described. The combination of an ideal bandgap of 1.61 eV and excellent compositional stability under ambient conditions make it a promising candidate for integration in solar cells. Planar solar cells utilizing [NH2C(I)=NH2](2)(CH3NH3)(2)Pb2I8 exhibit two interesting phenomena in the photovoltaic performance: an exponential dependence of Lc on incident light intensity and abnormal J-V response. To investigate the photophysical properties of [NH2C(I)=NH2](2)(CH3NH3)(2)Pb2I8 perovskite planar solar cells, intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were conducted. It is found that the planar structured solar cells of the layered perovskite suffer from bulk recombination which limits the charge collection and photocurrent. Use of a mesoporous TiO2 scaffold layer largely overcomes the recombination limitations of the layered perovskite and significantly improves the photovoltaic performance.

The low intrinsic stability of the early developed organic versions has however hampered their widespread applications. Very recently, all-inorganic perovskite nanocrystals have emerged as a new class of materials that hold great promise for the practical applications in solar cells, photodetectors, light-emitting diodes, and lasers, among others. In this Outlook, we first discuss the recent developments in the preparation, properties, and applications of all-inorganic metal halide perovskite nanocrystals, with a particular focus on CsPbX3, and then provide our view of current challenges and future directions in this emerging area. Our goal is to introduce the current status of this type of new materials to researchers from different areas and motivate them to explore all the potentials.

J	Hentz, O; Rekemeyer, P; Gradecak, S				Hentz, Olivia; Rekemeyer, Paul; Gradecak, Silvija			Effects of Voltage Biasing on Current Extraction in Perovskite Solar Cells	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						electron beam-induced current; ion migration; organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells	ORGANOMETAL TRIHALIDE PEROVSKITE; METHYLAMMONIUM LEAD IODIDE; ANOMALOUS HYSTERESIS; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; IONIC TRANSPORT; MIGRATION; FILMS; SENSITIZERS; EFFICIENCY; STABILITY	The recent rapid increase in efficiency of organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has resulted in a need to develop a clear understanding of their stability and working mechanisms. In particular, it has been suggested that ion migration contributes to the commonly observed hysteresis in the current-voltage measurements of PSCs, but the rate of ion migration and its effects on the electronic properties of PSCs remain to be addressed. In this work, electron-beam-induced current (EBIC) is used to directly map changes in local current extraction in organic-inorganic PSCs under applied voltage. By combining EBIC mapping, standard current-voltage measurements, and external quantum efficiency measurements, it is shown that between the two potential roles that point defects play in device enhancement under voltage biasing, the effects caused by defect-mediated ion migration outweigh the effects from the filling of trap states caused by these defects. Evidence is also provided for ion migration preferentially at local features such as extended defects. The measured timescale of tens of seconds for migration across a full device imply that ion migration contributes indirectly to the electronic capacitance of perovskite devices through interface charging.

Here we present compelling evidences that CH3NH3PbI3 crystals self-grown on FTO/TiO2 substrate consist of ferroic domains with alternating polar and nonpolar orders, in contrast to previous experimental and theoretical expectations, and polar domains possess reduced photocurrent. It is found that polar and nonpolar orders of CH3NH3PbI3 can be distinguished from their distinct lateral piezoresponse, energy dissipation, first and second harmonic electromechanical couplings, and temperature variation, even though their difference in crystalline lattice is very subtle, and they possess two-way memory effect through cubic-tetragonal phase transition. We hope these findings resolve key questions regarding polar nature of CH3NH3PbI3 and its implication on photovoltaics, reconcile contradictory data widely reported, and point a direction toward engineering ferroic domains for enhanced PCE.

Inducing spontaneous electric polarizations in double perovskite iodide superlattices for ferroelectric photovoltaic materials	PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS			English	Article							HALIDE PEROVSKITE; SOLAR-CELLS; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURES; A-SITE; OXIDES; EFFICIENCY; CONDUCTIVITY; VACANCY; DESIGN; CSSNI3	In this work, we use density functional theory calculations to demonstrate how spontaneous electric polarizations can be induced via a hybrid improper ferroelectric mechanism in iodide perovskites, a family well known to display solar-optimal band gaps, to create materials for photoferroic applications. We first assemble three chemically distinct (AA')(BB')I-6 double perovskites using centrosymmetric ABI(3) perovskite iodides (where A = Cs, Rb, K and B = Sn, Ge) as building units. In each superlattice, we investigate the effects of three types of A- and B-site cation ordering schemes and three different BI6 octahedral rotation patterns. Out of these 27 combinations, we find that 15 produce polar space groups and display spontaneous electric polarizations ranging from 0.26 to 23.33 mu C/cm(2) . Furthermore, we find that a layered A-site/rock salt B-site ordering, in the presence of an a(0)a(0) c(+) rotation pattern, produces a chiral vortex-like A-site displacement pattern. We then investigate the effect of epitaxial strain on one of these compounds, (CsRb)(SnGe)I-6 , in layered and rock salt ordered configurations. In both phases, we find strong competition between the cation ordering schemes as well as an enhancement of the spontaneous polarization magnitude under tensile strain. Finally, using a hybrid density functional with fractional Fock exchange, we find the iodide superlattices display semiconducting band gaps ranging from 0.2 to 1.3 eV. These results demonstrate that cation ordering and epitaxial strain are powerful ways to induce and control functionalities in technologically useful families of materials.

The patterned growth was demonstrated with different perovskite crystallization methods. We investigated and successfully demonstrated the controlled assembly of two MAPbI(3) nanomaterials, one a nanocomposite formed between the perovskite and a hole conducting polymer poly(2,5-bis(N-methyl-N-hexylamino)phenylene vinylene) (BAMPPV), and a second formed from perovskite crystals using common solution based MAPbI(3) growth methods (1-step and 2-step processing). Both types of MAPbI(3) crystals were fabricated on hydrophobic TiO2 nanotemplates composed of nanowells or grating patterns. Patterned areas as large as 100 mu m x 100 mu m were achieved. We examined and characterized the substrates using atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and energy dispersive spectroscopy. We present the optical properties (i.e. fluorescence and transmission) of soft nanoimprinted nanowells decorated with perovskites demonstrating the successful synthesis of MAPbI(3) perovskite nanocrystals. As an example of their use, we demonstrate a two terminal device and show photocurrent response of a perovskite patterned micro-grating. Our method is a nondestructive approach to nanopatterning perovskites, and produces patterned arrays that maintain their photo-electric properties. The results presented herein suggests an attractive route to developing nanopatterned and small area perovskite substrates for applications in photovoltaics, x-ray sensing/detection, image sensor arrays, and others.

Herein, we demonstrate an approach to prepare PSCs with high stability and efficiency by adding n-octyltrimethylammonium bromide (OTAB) to the precursor solution. In the resultant films, the charge trap density exhibits a significant reduction, and the long-term stability shows a remarkable enhancement. Upon adding 0.5 mg mL(-1) OTAB, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs reaches 18.32% under simulated AM 1.5G solar illumination, which represents an increase of 16% compared to the pristine devices. Moreover, the OTAB-modified devices demonstrate excellent performances both in high-temperature (70 degrees C, 40 +/- 5% relative humidity) and high-humidity (25 degrees C, 75 +/- 5% relative humidity) environments. These results indicate a very promising approach to improve the comprehensive performance of PSCs.

In particular, the directional mechanical and structural characteristics of this material have remained elusive. Here, we investigate these properties by monitoring the propagation of longitudinal and shear phonons following the absorption of a femtosecond pulse along various crystalline directions of a CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal. We first extract the sound velocities of longitudinal and transverse phonons along these directions of the crystal. Our study then reveals the negative directional thermal expansion of CH3NH3PbI3, which is responsible for strong coherent shear phonon generation. Finally, from these observations, we perform elastic characterization of this material, revealing a large directional Poisson's ratio, which reaches 0.7 and that we associate with the weak mechanical stability of this material. Our results also provide guidelines to fabricate a transducer of high-frequency transverse phonons.

Both the few surface traps and high loading of QDs are obtained by in situ ligand exchange with TBAI. The device is sensitive to a broad wavelength range covering the UV-NIR region (300-850 nm), showing an excellent photoresponsivity of 53 mA/W, a fast response time of <<0.02s, and remarkably high detectivity values of 8 X 10(13) Jones at 450 nm and 1 X 1013 Jones at 800 nm without an external bias voltage. Such performance is superior to what has been reported earlier for QD-based photodetectors. The photodetector exhibits excellent stability, keeping 98% of photoelectric responsivity after 2 months of illumination in air even without encapsulation. In addition, the semitransparent device is successfully fabricated using a Ag nanowires/polyimide transparent substrate. Such self-powered photodetectors with fast response speed and a stable, broad-band response are expected to function under a broad range of environmental conditions.

The hysteresis behavior, however, is one of the major concerning issues accompanying the development of PSCs. In this context, we propose a new mechanism that explains the origin of hysteresis behavior by analyzing the electrical processes after changing the external electrical bias: the compensating electric field to the scanning voltage induced by drifting carriers. This is further verified by experiments, where we observed much reduced hysteresis in the current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics for the PSCs based on a thinner perovskite layer, which is a result of more evenly distributed electrons and holes. Moreover, light illumination with different wavelengths was applied to vary the initial carrier distribution inside the perovskite layer. We found that J-V curves when illuminating the device with longer wavelengths exhibited diminished hysteresis, which could be a result of more evenly generated carriers due to a smaller absorptivity than that with short wavelength illumination. Based on the proposed model, three key factors affecting the hysteresis behavior were pointed out, including the initial carrier distribution, the carrier transport properties in the perovskite layer, and the carrier extraction properties at the interfaces. Strategies to construct hysteresis-free and stable PSCs have thus been accordingly proposed.

Alongside breakthroughs in synthesis and device engineering, halide perovskite photovoltaic materials have been the subject of predictive and explanatory computational work. In this Minireview, we focus on a subset of this computation: density functional theory (DFT)-based work highlighting the ways in which the electronic structure and band gap of this class of materials can be tuned via changes in atomic structure. We distill this body of computational literature into a set of underlying design principles for the band gap engineering of these materials, and rationalize these principles from the viewpoint of band-edge orbital character. We hope that this perspective provides guidance and insight toward the rational design and continued improvement of perovskite photovoltaics.

Specifically, we find that dispersing ITIC molecules can largely decrease the J(sc) (photocurrent difference) generated by switching the photoexcitation from linear to circular polarization with the same intensity. This phenomenon provides direct evidence that dispersed optically polarizable ITIC molecules can increase the SOC in organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites through interaction between introduced electrical polarization and SOC. Furthermore, impedance studies indicate that dispersing ITIC molecules can decrease the density of trap states by passivating the grain boundary defects and simultaneously increases the carrier mobilities. Consequently, non-radiative recombination is reduced upon decreasing the density of trap states through dispersing the ITIC molecules, according to transient photoluminescence studies. The UV-Vis and FTIR spectral studies indicate formation of a bond between Pb, N and O, showing a direct interaction between the hybrid perovskite MAPbI(3-x)Cl(x) and dispersed ITIC molecules. Clearly, introducing optically polarizable non-fullerene electron acceptor molecules presents a new opportunity to enhance photovoltaic actions in perovskite solar cells through SOC and grain boundary passivation effects.

Insights on the Synthesis, Crystal and Electronic Structures, and Optical and Thermoelectric Properties of Sr1-xSbxHfSe3 Orthorhombic Perovskite	INORGANIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article							INITIO MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; DOT SOLAR-CELLS; CHALCOGENIDE PEROVSKITES; THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; METAL CHALCOGENIDES; MAGNETIC-PROPERTIES; TRANSITION; TERNARY; PERFORMANCE	Single-phase polycrystalline powders of Sr1-xSbxHfSe3 (x = 0, 0.005, 0.01), a new member of the chalcogenide perovskites, were synthesized using a combination of high temperature solid-state reaction and mechanical alloying approaches. Structural analysis using single-crystal as well as powder X-ray diffraction revealed that the synthesized materials are isostructural with SrZrSe3, crystallizing in the orthorhombic space group Pnma (#62) with lattice parameters a = 8.901(2) angstrom; b = 3.943 (1) angstrom; c = 14.480(3) angstrom; and Z = 4 for the x = 0 composition. Thermal conductivity data of SrHfSe3 revealed low values ranging from 0.9 to 1.3 W m(-1) K-1 from 300 to 700 K, which is further lowered to 0.77 W m(-1) K-1 by doping with 1 mol % Sb for Sr. Electronic property measurements indicate that the compound is quite insulating with an electrical conductivity of 2.9 S/cm at 873 K, which was improved to 6.7 S/cm by 0.5 mol % Sb doping. Thermopower data revealed that SrHfSe3 is a p-type semiconductor with thermopower values reaching a maximum of 287 mu V/K at 873 K for the 1.0 mol % Sb sample. The optical band gap of Sr1-xSbxHfSe3 samples, as determined by density functional theory calculations and the diffuse reflectance method, is similar to 1.00 eV and increases with Sb concentration to 1.15 eV. Careful analysis of the partial densities of states (PDOS) indicates that the band gap in SrHfSe3 is essentially determined by the Se-4p and Hf-Sd orbitals with little to no contribution from Sr atoms. Typically, band edges of p- and d-character are a good indication of potentially strong absorption coefficient due to the high density of states of the localized p and d orbitals. This points to potential application of SrHfSe3 as absorbing layer in photovoltaic devices.

To address this problem, phosphor-in-glass (PiG) is used to convert UV to visible light. Down-conversion of UV light by PiG dramatically increases UV-stability of PSCs and enables PSCs to harvest UV light that is currently wasted. Performance of PSCs with PiG layer does not change significantly during 100 h-long UV-irradiation, while conventional PSCs degrade quickly by 1 h-long UV-irradiation. After 100 h long UV-irradiation, power conversion efficiency of PSCs with PiG is 440% larger than that of conventional PSCs. This result points a direction toward PSCs which are very stable and highly efficient under UV light.

Module prices are dropping rapidly and solar energy has already reached grid parity in many areas. Solar module costs now constitute a small fraction of the total systems costs and to continue system cost reduction, increasing efficiency becomes even more critical. Multi junction solar cells are the most logical path to increase PV module performance beyond 25%, but the varieties available today are still are out-performed in efficiency or cost by the main stream single-junction technologies: crystalline Si, CdTe and CIGS. Finding a solution for this problem is attracting a growing research interest. We review the latest developments in the field with particular focus on thin-film high band gap candidates such as perovskites on commercial bottom cells including silicon, CdTe and CIGS. We also review the current state of all-chalcopyrite tandems, and promising concepts using CdTe-alloys as a top cell on silicon.

Continuous Grain-Boundary Functionalization for High-Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells with Exceptional Stability	CHEM			English	Article							HALIDE PEROVSKITES; THIN-FILMS; PERFORMANCE; TRIHALIDE; LAYERS; EXTRACTION	Here, we sucessfully demonstrate the continuous functionalization of grain boundaries (GBs) in CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI(3)) organic-inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP) thin films with a triblock copolymer that contains rationally selected hydrophilic-hydrophobic-hydrophilic symmetric blocks. The addition of the triblock copolymer into the precursor solution assists in perovskite solution crystallization, resulting in ultrasmooth thin films with GB regions that are continuously functionalized. Tuning of the thickness of the functionalized GBs is realized, leading to MAPbI(3) OIHP thin films with simultaneously enhanced optoelectronic properties and environmental (thermal, moisture, and light) stability. The resulting perovskite solar cells show high stabilized efficiency of 19.4%, most of which is retained (92%) upon 480-hr 1-sun illumination. This approach is generic in nature, and it can be extended to a wide range of OIHPs and beyond.

In this work, we study the photovoltaic potential of solution-processed antimony (Sb)-based compounds with the formula A(3)Sb(2)I(9) (A = Cs, Rb, and K). We experimentally determine bandgap magnitude and type, structure, carrier lifetime, exciton binding energy, film morphology, and photovoltaic device performance. We use density functional theory to compute the equilibrium structures, band structures, carrier effective masses, and phase stability diagrams. We find the A-site cation governs the structural and optoelectronic properties of these compounds. Cs3Sb2I9 has a 0D structure, the largest exciton binding energy (175 +/- 9 meV), an indirect bandgap, and, in a solar cell, low photocurrent (0.13 mA cm(-2)). Rb3Sb2I9 has a 2D structure, a direct bandgap, and, among the materials investigated, the lowest exciton binding energy (101 +/- 6 meV) and highest photocurrent (1.67 mA cm(-2)). K3Sb2I9 has a 2D structure, intermediate exciton binding energies (129 +/- 9 meV), and intermediate photocurrents (0.41 mA cm(-2)). Despite remarkably long lifetimes in all compounds (54, 9, and 30 ns for Cs-, Rb-, and K-based materials, respectively), low photocurrents limit performance of all devices. We conclude that carrier collection is limited by large exciton binding energies (experimentally observed) and large carrier effective masses (calculated from density functional theory). The highest photocurrent and efficiency (0.76%) were observed in the Rb-based compound with a direct bandgap, relatively lower exciton binding energy, and lower calculated electron effective mass. To reliably screen for candidate lead-free photovoltaic absorbers, we advise that faster and more accurate computational tools are needed to calculate exciton binding energies and effective masses.

The effect is a consequence of a strongly nonlinear dependence of the alloy band gap on chemical composition. Here, we use electronic structure calculations at different levels of theory (density functional theory (DFT), hybrid DFT, and QSGW, with and without spin-orbit interactions) to investigate the presently elusive origin of this effect. Contrary to current conflicting studies, our results show that neither spin-orbit interactions nor the composition induced changes of the crystal structure and ordering of atoms contributes to the nonlinearity of the band gap. We find that the strong nonlinearity is primarily a consequence of chemical effects, i.e., the mismatch in energy between s and p atomic orbitals of Pb and Sn, which form the band edges of the alloy. These results unravel the nature of the band gap bowing in Sn/Pb hybrid perovskite alloys and offer a relatively simple way to estimate evolution of the band gap in other hybrid perovskite alloys.

In this study, this concern was addressed by analysing the life cycle toxicity of metals (cadmium, copper, lead, nickel, tin and zinc) that are commonly used in emerging PVs. In estimating the potential metal release, a new model that incorporates field conditions (crack size, time, and glass thickness) and physiochemical properties (diffusion coefficient and solubility product) was introduced. The results show that the use phase toxicity of copper and lead can be higher than the extraction phase toxicity. Thus, precautionary loss limits to manage toxic impacts from the use phase were proposed. Also, the toxicity from different layers of perovskite, copper zinc tin sulphide (CZTS), and quantum dot (Qp) type of solar cells was compared. It was found that cadmium sulphide (compared to zinc oxide and tin oxide) and lead (II) sulphide (compared to lead (II) iodine and CZTS) were less toxic alternatives for the electron selective layer and light absorber, respectively. Finally, in comparing the toxic metal releases of the PVs to today's coal power plants, it was seen that the metal emissions from PVs are expected to be several times less than the emissions from coal.

Accordingly, it is greatly demanded to precisely tune and further improve the UV absorption of TiO2 to significantly broaden its versatility. Herein, we report an extraordinary enhancement of UV absorption in TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) incorporated with graphene nanodots (GNDs) of low oxygen concentration. Chemically bonded TiO2 NP/GND composites exhibit highly tunable UV absorption, achieving over 243% enhancement of molar extinction coefficient at 336 nm. We found that the drastic improvement is a result of the direct charge transfer from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of GNDs to the conduction bands of TiO2, enabled by wide/direct band gaps in GNDs with a small amount of oxygen. Also, the significantly improved power conversion efficiency (PCE similar to 16.74%) and UV stability of the TiO2 NP/GND composites reveal their high promise for applications benefiting from TiO2 NP/GND composites, such as solar cells and photolysis.

Perovskite Carrier Transport: Disentangling the Impacts of Effective Mass and Scattering Time Through Microscopic Optical Detection	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article							LEAD HALIDE PEROVSKITES; REFRACTIVE-INDEX; SOLAR-CELLS; THIN-FILMS; POLARON MOBILITY; DEFECT TOLERANCE; EXCITON BINDING; MATRIX-METHOD; METHYLAMMONIUM; HYBRID	While carrier mobility is a practical and commonly cited measure of transport, it conflates the effects of two more fundamental material properties: the effective mass and mean scattering time of charge carriers. This Letter describes the correlation of two ultrafast imaging techniques to disentangle the effect of each on carrier transport in lead halide perovskites. Two materials are compared: methylammonium lead tri-iodide (MAPbI(3)) and cesium lead bromide diiodide (CsPbBrI2). By correlating photoinduced changes to the refractive index with a direct measure of carrier diffusion, both the carrier optical mass and mean scattering time are uniquely determined on microscopic length scales. These results show that the factor of 4 lower mobility of CsPbBrI2 is due not to differing optical masses of charge carriers, which are measured to be similar in CsPbBrI2 and MAPbI(3), but rather to a difference in mean carrier scattering time. The scope and limitations of the approach are discussed.

Excitation Intensity Dependence of Photoluminescence Blinking in CsPbBr3 Perovskite Nanocrystals	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							CESIUM-LEAD-HALIDE; QUANTUM-DOT BLINKING; SINGLE-PHOTON EMISSION; FLUORESCENCE INTERMITTENCY; SOLAR-CELLS; LUMINESCENCE; BIEXCITONS	Perovskite semiconductors have emerged as a promising class of materials for optoelectronic applications. Their favorable device performances can be partly justified by the defect tolerance that originates from their electronic structure. The effect of this inherent defect tolerance, namely the absence of deep trap states, on the photoluminescence (PL) of perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) is currently not well understood. The PL emission of NCs fluctuates in time according to power law kinetics (PL intermittency, or blinking), a phenomenon that has been explored over the past two decades in a vast array of nanocrystal (NC) materials. The kinetics of the blinking process in perovskite NCs have not been widely explored. Here, PL trajectories of individual orthorhombic cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) perovskite NCs are measured using a range of excitation intensities. The power law kinetics of the bright NC state are observed to truncate exponentially at long durations, with a truncation time that decreases with increasing intensity before saturating at an intensity corresponding to an average formation of a single exciton. The results indicate that a diffusion-controlled electron transfer (DCET) mechanism is the most likely charge trapping process, while Auger autoionization plays a lesser role. The relevance of the multiple recombination centers (MRC) model to the results presented here cannot be ascertained, since the underlying switching mechanism is not currently available. Further experimentation and theoretical work are needed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the photophysics in these emerging materials.	[Gibson, Natalie A.; Koscher, Brent A.; Alivisatos, A.

Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) studies reveal d(33)(MAPbI)3 values of 0.3-0.4 pm/V for MAPbI(3) deposited on Au, indium tin oxide, and SrTiO3 surfaces, with small phase angle fluctuating at length scales smaller than the grain size. In sharp contrast, on samples prepared on epitaxial PZT films, we observe large-scale polar domains exhibiting clear, close to 180 degrees PFM phase contrasts, pointing to polar axes along the film normal. By separating the piezoresponse contributions from the MAPbI(3) and PZT layers, we extract a significantly higher d(33)(MAPbI)3 of similar to 4 pm/V, which is attributed to the enhanced alignment of the MA molecular dipoles promoted by the unbalanced surface potential of PZT. We also discuss the effect of the interfacial screening layer on the preferred polar direction.

The responsivity, detectivity, and response time as the critical parameters of CH3NH3PbI3/C8BTBT BHJ network photodetectors reach 8.1 AW(-1), 2.17 x 10(12) Jones, and 7.1 ms, respectively. Meanwhile, they can maintain over 70% of original performance even when exposed to ambient conditions (humidity similar to 45%) for 50 days without encapsulation. Furthermore, the CH3NH3PbI3/C8BTBT BHJ network photodetectors fabricated on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate exhibit superior flexibility at different bending radii and large numbers of bending cycles. The photocurrent just shows a decrease of less than 5% as the devices are bent for 10 000 cycles at a small radius of 7.5 mm. The present research indicates that BHJ networks composed of perovskites and organic semiconductors open up the exciting opportunity for fabricating high-performance, low-cost, flexible electronic and optoelectronic devices.

Control of the Nucleation and Growth of the Lead Acetate Solution Derived CH3NH3PbI3 Films Leads to Enhanced Power Conversion Efficiency	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						nucleation; perovskite; solar cells; power conversion efficiency; spin coating	PEROVSKITE SOLAR-CELLS; CRYSTALLIZATION; LAYER	Control of the nucleation and growth of the CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI(3)) phase is one of the important issues in the development of the high-performance MAPbI(3) perovskite solar cells. In this work, we demonstrated a novel and easy nucleation-controlling process to fabricate high-performance MAPbI(3) solar cells using lead acetate as a precursor. The morphology and crystallinity of the final annealed perovskite film is greatly influenced by the intermediate phase in the precursor film. Efficient removal of the solvent and reactants by the use of long-time spin coating process makes the MAPbI(3) nucleate at room temperature and grain coarsening during the anneal, resulting in the annealed films with smooth surface and high compactness. Precise control of the spin coating time made the average power conversion efficiency of the MAPbI(3) solar cells increase from 12-13% to 15-16%.

Highly Crystalline Methylammonium Lead Tribromide Perovskite Films for Efficient Photovoltaic Devices	ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							ORGANOMETAL HALIDE PEROVSKITES; VOLTAGE SOLAR-CELLS; BROMIDE PEROVSKITE; SINGLE-CRYSTALS; DEPOSITION; PASSIVATION; PERFORMANCE; MOBILITIES; MANAGEMENT; DIFFUSION	The rise of metal-halide perovskite solar cells has captivated the research community, promising to disrupt the current energy landscape. While a sizable percentage of the research done on this class of materials has been focused on the neat and iodide-rich perovskites, bromide-based perovskites can deliver substantially higher voltages because of their relatively wide band gaps of over 2 eV. The potential for efficient, high-voltage devices makes materials such as these incredibly attractive for multijunction photovoltaic applications. Here, we use the acetonitrile/methylamine solvent system to deposit smooth, highly crystalline films of CH3NH3PbBr3. By using choline chloride as a passivating agent for these films, we achieve photoluminescence quantum efficiencies of up to 5.5% and demonstrate charge-carrier mobilities of 17.8 cm(2)/(V s). Incorporating these films into photovoltaic devices, we achieve scanned power conversion efficiencies of up to 8.9%, with stabilized efficiencies of 7.6%, providing a simple route to realizing efficient, high-voltage CH3NH3PbBr3 planar-heterojunction devices.

Interplay of Mobile Ions and Injected Carriers Creates Recombination Centers in Metal Halide Perovskites under Bias	ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							ORGANOMETAL TRIHALIDE PEROVSKITE; METHYLAMMONIUM LEAD IODIDE; SOLAR-CELLS; INTRINSIC DEFECTS; PHOTOLUMINESCENCE; HYSTERESIS; MIGRATION; SEGREGATION; PERFORMANCE; CONDUCTION	We study the interaction of mobile ions and electronic charges to form nonradiative defects during electric biasing of methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI(3)) and forrnamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI(3)) thin films. Using multimodal microscopy that combines in situ photoluminescence and scanning Kelvin probe microscopy in a lateral electrode geometry, we correlate temporal changes in radiative recombination with the spatial movement of ionic and electronic charge carriers. Importantly, we compare trap formation with both charge injecting and blocking contacts. Even though ion migration takes place in both cases, we observe the formation of new nonradiative defects in MAPbI(3) only in the presence of injected electrons, suggesting that redox processes play a key role. On the basis of density functional theory (DFT) simulations, we propose that reduction of Pb2+ to Pb-0 is responsible for the new defects formed in our films. These results underscore that defect properties in metal halide perovskites are not only determined by the migration of mobile ions but are also highly sensitive to their interaction with injected electronic charge.

Herein, we report a new hydrogen evolution nanowire electrocatalyst, consisting of S-doped CoWP nanoparticles embedded in S- and N-doped carbon matrix (S-CoWP@(S,N)-C), which is in situ transformed from Hofmann-type (Co, W)-based metal-organic framework (MOF) nanowires. Because of S and N doping to the carbon matrix and the S doping to CoWP nanoparticles, the obtained S-CoWP@(S,N)-C catalyst reaches a current density of -10 mA cm(-2) at -35 and -67 mV (vs RHE) in acidic and alkaline electrolytes, respectively. Powered by a lead halide perovskite solar cell, an unassisted two-electrode solar water-splitting device using MOF-derived S-CoWP@(S,N)-C HER electrocatalysts and S-CoW@(S,N)-C OER electrocatalysts displays a solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 10.98%. Our method is highly applicable for developing robust electrocatalysts toward efficient and low-cost solar-driven water splitting.

Exploration of Near-Infrared-Emissive Colloidal Multinary Lead Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals Using an Automated Microfluidic Platform	ACS NANO			English	Article						perovskites; microfluidics; nanocrystals; formamidinium; quantum dots; halides	LIGHT-EMITTING-DIODES; ANION-EXCHANGE REACTIONS; WIDE-COLOR-GAMUT; ORGANIC-INORGANIC PEROVSKITES; SINGLE-PHOTON EMISSION; HYBRID SOLAR-CELLS; QUANTUM DOTS; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; ROOM-TEMPERATURE; SEMICONDUCTOR NANOCRYSTALS	Hybrid organic-inorganic and fully inorganic lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) have recently emerged as versatile solution-processable light-emitting and light-harvesting optoelectronic materials. A particularly difficult challenge lies in warranting the practical utility of such semiconductor NCs in the red and infrared spectral regions. In this context, all three archetypal A-site monocationic perovskites-CH3NH3PbI3, CH(NH2)(2)PbI3, and CsPbI3-suffer from either chemical or thermodynamic instabilities in their bulk form. A promising approach toward the mitigation of these challenges lies in the formation of multinary compositions (mixed cation and mixed anion). In the case of multinary colloidal NCs, such as quinary Cs(x)FA(1-x)Pb-(Br1-yIy)(3) NCs, the outcome of the synthesis is defined by a complex interplay between the bulk thermodynamics of the solid solutions, crystal surface energies, energetics, dynamics of capping ligands, and the multiple effects of the reagents in solution. Accordingly, the rational synthesis of such NCs is a formidable challenge. Herein, we show that droplet-based microfluidics can successfully tackle this problem and synthesize Cs(x)FA(1-x)PbI(3) and Cs(x)FA(1-x)Pb(Br1-yIy)(3) NCs in both a time- and cost-efficient manner. Rapid in situ photoluminescence and absorption measurements allow for thorough parametric screening, thereby permitting precise optical engineering of these NCs. In this showcase study, we fine-tune the photoluminescence maxima of such multinary NCs between 700 and 800 nm, minimize their emission line widths (to below 40 nm), and maximize their photoluminescence quantum efficiencies (up to 89%) and phase/chemical stabilities. Detailed structural analysis revealed that the Cs(x)FA(1-x)Pb(Br1-yIy)(3) NCs adopt a cubic perovskite structure of FAPbI(3), with iodide anions partially substituted by bromide ions. Most importantly, we demonstrate the excellent transference of reaction parameters from microfluidics to a conventional flask based environment, thereby enabling up-scaling and further implementation in optoelectronic devices. As an example, Cs(x)FA(1-x)Pb(Br1-yIy)(3) NCs with an emission maximum at 735 nm were integrated into light-emitting diodes, exhibiting a high external quantum efficiency of 5.9% and a very narrow electroluminescence spectral bandwidth of 27 nm.

Conjugated Polyelectrolytes as Efficient Hole Transport Layers in Perovskite Light-Emitting Diodes	ACS NANO			English	Article						perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs); conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs); hole transport layer (HTL); PEDOT:PSS; electroluminescence; LEDs; lead halide perovskites	METAL-HALIDE PEROVSKITES; SOLAR-CELLS; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; HIGHLY EFFICIENT; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; INTERFACIAL CONTROL; GRAPHENE OXIDE; QUANTUM DOTS; PHOTOLUMINESCENCE; NANOCRYSTALS	Perovskite-based optoelectronic devices have been rapidly developing in the past 5 years. Since the first report, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) has increased rapidly through the control of morphology and structure from 0.1% to more than 11%. Here, we report the use of various conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) as the hole injection layer in PeLEDs. In particular, we find that poly[2,6-(4,4-bis-potassium butanylsulfonate)-4H-cyclopenta-[2,1-b;3,4-b']-dithiophene)] (PCPDT-K) transfers holes effectively, blocks electron transport from the perovskite to the underlying ITO layer, and reduces luminescence quenching at the perovskite/PCPDT-K interface. Our optimized PeLEDs with PCPDT-K show enhanced EQE by a factor of approximately 4 compared to control PeLEDs with PEDOT:PSS, reaching EQE values of 5.66%, and exhibit improved device stability.

It was reported that the crystallinity of hybrid thin-film perovskite materials plays an important role in device performance. In this study, we report a novel and simple method to tune the crystallinity of CH3NH3PbI3 thin film for device performance of perovskite solar cells. By employing tetraphenylphosphonium chloride on the top of PbI2 thin layer in the two-step perovskite deposition processes, the crystallinity of the resultant CH3NH3PbI3 thin film was tuned. As a result, perovskite solar cells by the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film with tuned crystallinity exhibit an enlarged open-circuit voltage and enhanced short-circuit current, thus boosted efficiency as well as reduced photocurrent hysteresis compared to pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film. These results indicate that our study provides a new simple way to boost device performance of perovskite solar cells through tuning the crystallinity of CH3NH3PbI3 thin film.

Ion substitution has been pursued as an attractive solution to alter the crystallization or induced electronic of organic-inorganic hybrid halide lead perovskite. However, the disorganized structure of perovskite result from inappropriate substitution may cause unwanted phase transition and photo-stability. Herein, we introduce crystallization of restriction ABX(3) composition with moderate zinc (Zn) substitution to obtain the ordered and stable CH3NH3(Zn: Pb)I3-xClx crystal, which is achieved via releasing lattice strain during an appropriate lattice constriction within BX6 octahedron. We obtained an unprecedented efficiency of 20.06% under simulated sunlight with facilitating binary metal perovskite of CH3NH3(1Zn: 100Pb)I3-xClx. Our results are important to realize scale up and practical applications of efficient planar perovskite solar cells.

Correlating a novel nanoscale near-field scanning photocurrent microscopy (NSPM) technique with X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy data, we found that the segregation of lead iodide (PbI2) driven either by a temperature treatment or by extended light exposure can impact the photocurrent at grain boundaries. In samples annealed at a moderate temperature (100 degrees C), a small amount of expelled PbI2 passivates the grain boundaries and improves photocurrent generation. A higher annealing temperature (130 degrees C) causes further segregation of PbI2 at grain boundaries, decreasing the photocurrent. Extended light illumination drives further material segregation, decreasing photocurrent both at grain boundaries and grain interiors.

Cation-Dependent Light-Induced Halide Demixing in Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Perovskites	NANO LETTERS			English	Article						Metal halide perovskite; halide demixing; cation variation; photoluminescence; in situ characterization	FORMAMIDINIUM LEAD IODIDE; TANDEM SOLAR-CELLS; PHASE-SEPARATION; THIN-FILMS; PERFORMANCE; SEGREGATION; EFFICIENCY; SEMICONDUCTORS; RECOMBINATION; STABILIZATION	Mixed cation metal halide perovskites with increased power conversion efficiency, negligible hysteresis, and improved long-term stability under illumination, moisture, and thermal stressing have emerged as promising compounds for photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications. Here, we shed light on photoinduced halide demixing using in situ photoluminescence spectroscopy and in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) to directly compare the evolution of composition and phase changes in CH(NH2)(2) CsPb-halide (FACsPb-) and CH3NH3 Pb-halide (MAPb-) perovskites upon illumination, thereby providing insights into why FACs-perovskites are less prone to halide demixing than MA-perovskites. We find that halide demixing occurs in both materials. However, the I-rich domains formed during demixing accumulate strain in FACsPb-perovskites but readily relax in MA-perovskites. The accumulated strain energy is expected to act as a stabilizing force against halide demixing and may explain the higher Br composition threshold for demixing to occur in FACsPb-halides. In addition, we find that while halide demixing leads to a quenching of the high-energy photoluminescence emission from MA-perovskites, the emission is enhanced from FACs-perovskites. This behavior points to a reduction of nonradiative recombination centers in FACs-perovskites arising from the demixing process and buildup of strain. FACsPb-halide perovskites exhibit excellent intrinsic material properties with photoluminescence quantum yields that are comparable to MA-perovskites. Because improved stability is achieved without sacrificing electronic properties, these compositions are better candidates for photovoltaic applications, especially as wide bandgap absorbers in tandem cells.

Paul			The Making and Breaking of Lead-Free Double Perovskite Nanocrystals of Cesium Silver-Bismuth Halide Compositions	NANO LETTERS			English	Article						Lead-free halide perovskites; double perovskites; cesium silver bismuth halides; perovskite nanocrystals	SOLAR-CELLS; PHOTOVOLTAIC APPLICATIONS; HYBRID PEROVSKITES; SEMICONDUCTOR; EFFICIENT; NANOPLATELETS; TRANSITIONS; CS2AGBIBR6; CHEMISTRY; BR	Replacing lead in halide perovskites is of great interest due to concerns about stability and toxicity. Recently, lead free double perovskites in which the unit cell is doubled and two divalent lead cations are substituted by a combination of monoand trivalent cations have been synthesized as bulk single crystals and as thin films. Here, we study stability and optical properties of all-inorganic cesium silver(I) bismuth(III) chloride and bromide nanocrystals with the double perovskite crystal structure. The cube-shaped nanocrystals are monodisperse in size with typical side lengths of 8 to 15 nm. The absorption spectrum of the nanocrystals presents a sharp peak, which we assign to a direct bismuth s-p transition and not to a quantum confined excitonic transition. Using this spectroscopic handle combined with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) based elemental analysis, we conduct stoichiometric studies at the single nanocrystal level as well as decomposition assays in solution and observe that Ag+ diffusion and coalescence is one of the pathways by which this material degrades. Drying the nanocrystals leads to self-assembly into ordered nanocrystal solids, and these exhibit less degradation than nanocrystals in solution. Our results demonstrate that Cs2AgBiX6 (X = Cl, Br) nanocrystals are a useful model system to study structure-function relationships in the search for stable nontoxic halide perovskites.

In halide perovskites (ABX(3)), alloys with different anions have been widely studied, and great band gap tunability in the visible range has been achieved. However, perovskite alloys with different cations at the "B" site are less understood due to the synthetic challenges. Herein, we first have developed the synthesis of single-crystalline CsPbxSn1-xI3 nanowires (NWs). The electronic band gaps of CsPbxSn1-xI3 NWs can be tuned from 1.3 to 1.78 eV by varying the Pb/Sn ratio, which leads to the tunable photoluminescence (PL) in the near-infrared range. More importantly, we found that the electrical conductivity increases as more Sn2+ is alloyed with Pb2+ , possibly due to the increase of charge carrier concentration when more Sn2+ is introduced. The wide tunability of the optical and electronic properties makes CsPbxSn1-xI3 alloy NWs promising candidates for future optoelectronic device applications.
