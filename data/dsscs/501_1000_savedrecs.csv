Most notable is their photoactivity, as exemplified by their strong luminescence. Consequently, CNDs are currently being investigated as active components in photocatalysis, sensing, and optoelectronics. Charge-transfer interactions are common to all these areas. It is therefore essential to be able to fine-tune both the electronic structure of CNDs and the electronic communication in CND-based functional materials. The complex, but not completely deciphered, structure of CNDs necessitates, however, a multifaceted strategy to investigate their fundamental electronic structure and to establish structure-property relationships. Such investigations require a combination of spectroscopic methods, such as ultrafast transient absorption and fluorescence up-conversion techniques, electrochemistry, and modeling of CNDs, both in the absence and presence of other photoactive materials. Only a sound understanding of the dynamics of charge transfer, charge shift, charge transport, etc., with and without light makes much-needed improvements in, for example, photocatalytic processes, in which CNDs are used as either photosensitizers or catalytic centers, possible. This Account addresses the structural, photophysical, and electrochemical properties of CNDs, in general, and the charge transfer chemistry of CNDs, in particular. Pressure-synthesized CNDs (pCNDs), for which citric acid and urea are used as inexpensive and biobased precursor materials, lie at the center of attention. A simple microwave-assisted thermolytic reaction, performed in sealed vessels, yields pCNDs with a fairly homogeneous size distribution of similar to 1-2 nm. The narrow and excitation independent photoluminescence of pCNDs contrasts with that seen in CNDs synthesized by other techniques, making pCNDs optimal for in-depth physicochemical analyses. The atomistic and electronic structures of CNDs were also analyzed by quantum chemical modeling approaches that led to a range of possible structures, ranging from heavily functionalized, graphene-like structures to disordered amorphous particles containing small sp(2) domains. Both the electron-accepting and-donating performances of CNDs make the charge-transfer chemistry of CNDs rather versatile. Both covalent and noncovalent synthetic approaches have been explored, resulting in architectures of various sizes. CNDs, for example, have been combined with molecular materials ranging from electron-donating porphyrins and extended tetrathiafulvalenes to electron-accepting perylendiimides, or nanocarbon materials such as polymer-wrapped single-walled carbon nanotubes. In every case, charge-separated states formed as part of the reaction cascades initiated by photoexcitation. Charge-transfer assemblies including CNDs have also played a role in technological applications: for example, a proof-of-concept dye-sensitized solar cell was designed and tested, in which CNDs were adsorbed on the surface of mesoporous anatase TiO2. The wide range of reported electron-donor acceptor systems documents the versatility of CNDs as molecular building blocks, whose electronic properties are tunable for the needs of emerging technologies.",,,,,"Clark, Timothy/0000-0001-7931-4659",,,,,,,,,,,,0001-4842,1520-4898,,,,APR,2019,52,4,,,,,955,963,,10.1021/acs.accounts.8b00673,,,,,,,,WOS:000465189800012,30882201,,,,

This electrode has excellent electrical conductivity, chemical stability, and high electrocatalytic affinity for the reduction of triiodide. However, the high cost of metallic platinum and the poor electrochemical stability pose a major drawback in the commercial production. This has necessitated a search for a non-precious metal and metal-free electrocatalyst that demonstrates better catalytic activity and longer electrochemical stability for practical use in DSSCs. Graphene has been at the centre of attention due to its excellent optoelectronic properties. However, a defect-free graphene sheet is not suitable as a CE in DSSCs, because of its neutral polarity which often restricts efficient charge transfer at the graphene/liquid interface, irrespective of the high in-plane charge mobility. Hence, heteroatom-doped graphene-based CEs are being developed with the aim to balance electrical conductivity for efficient charge transfer and charge polarization for enhanced reduction activity of redox couples simultaneously. The elements commonly used in chemical doping of graphene are nitrogen, oxygen, boron, sulfur, and phosphorus. Halogens have also recently shown great promise. It has been demonstrated that edge-selective heteroatom-doping of graphene imparts both efficient in-plane charge transfers and polarity, thereby enhancing electrocatalytic activity. Thus, heteroatom-doped graphene serves as a good material to replace conventional electrodes and enhance power conversion efficiency in DSSCs. The focus is to reduce the cost of DSSCs. This review explores the performance of DSSCs, factors that influence the power conversion efficiency, and various physicochemical properties of graphene. It further outlines current progress on the synthetic approaches for chemical doping (substitutional and surface transfer doping) of graphene and graphene oxide with different heteroatoms in order to fine-tune the electronic properties.

Based on the comparison and better agreement between experimental wavelengths of maximum absorption and their calculated values with functionals of B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP and BHand-H, the B3LYP/6-31G** level was chosen for the process of our studies. The dyes' properties in solvent environment were carried out using conductor-like polarizable continuum model methods (CPCM-DFT and TD-CPCM-DFT). The results show that pigment type affects the photophysical properties, and the dyes of a specific pigment type have nearly the same properties. Anthocyanins have the highest values of ionization potential (IP), electron affinity (EA), electronic chemical potential (mu) (their absolute values), chemical hardness (eta), electrophilicity index (omega), electroaccepting power (omega(+)) and electrodonating power (omega(-)), which can lead to high efficiency of these dyes type for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).

Unique morphology regulatory effect of NH4+ ions on one-dimensional TiO2 nanorod arrays (TNAs) is proved in this research for the first time, but nitrogen-doping effect is hardly detected. Once NH4Cl is added, the growth of TNAs is greatly promoted especially in radial direction, but little amount of nitrogen from NH4+ ions can enter the modified TNAs (N-TNAs). Furthermore, the bandgap energy of N-TNAs is almost unchanged compared with TNAs, meaning that trace nitrogen doping does not affect response ability to irradiation. When fabricated into dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with N-TNAs, the optimal photoelectrical conversion efficiency (3.16%) is nearly twice that with TNAs (1.62%). It is worth noting that the increased efficiency mainly results from the photoinduced current but not voltage. Second, the change of conversion efficiency is related to nanorod length.

Their optical, structural, and morphological properties were analyzed by using UV-Visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that the pristine and doped ZnO nanorods were crystallized in a hexagonal wurtzite structure. SEM images supplemented with EDX were used to explore the morphology, size and chemical composition of pristine ZnO, Ag-doped ZnO and Nd-doped ZnO samples. UV visible absorption spectra showed that bathochromic shift occurred when ZnO nanorods were doped with Ag and Nd up to a certain limit of dopant concentration. Doped ZnO nanorods were found more conducing than prisitne ZnO nanorods. This work also represents the chemical modification of pristine ZnO, Ag-doped ZnO, and Nd-doped ZnO nanorods with a bromopyrogallol red dye (BrPGR) which is not reported yet. The pristine and doped samples were sensitized with Br-PGR and the material so sensitized was tested in solar cell. The optical properties of grafted samples were thoroughly studied by using UV-visible spectroscopy. The Nano-hybrid material was tested as a photoactive blend of the DSSCs and their current-voltage measurements (I-V) were performed to examine the effect of pristine and doped ZnO nanorods on the performance of solar cells. Moreover current voltage (I-V) measurements confirmed the boosting of efficiency in pristine and doped ZnO nanorods based DSSCs owing to their sensitization with Br-PGR. Maximum power conversion efficiency of 1% was recorded for Ag-doped ZnO nanorods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1369-8001,1873-4081,,,,APR,2019,93,,,,,,215,225,,10.1016/j.mssp.2019.01.009,,,,,,,,WOS:000457727300026,,,,,

For JX1 and JX2, the electron donors were modified with alkylbenzene containing long carbon chains, which can effectively inhibit dye aggregation and reduce charge recombination. Meanwhile, two benzoic acid groups were used as anchoring groups, we can see that the binding ways of JX1 and JX2 were both tetradentate mode from FT-IR analysis, this strategy helps to enhance the adsorption stability of dye molecules and increase the amount of dye adsorption. The DSSC based on JX1 showed a PCE of 3.67%, and the DSSC based on JX2 showed a higher PCE of 4.36%, the difference between them should be mainly attributed to the higher dye adsorption and better light-harvesting ability of JX2. In addition, developing new and efficient dyes is not the only way to improve performance of DSSCs, cosensitization is also one of the effective ways to achieve this goal. Although porphyrin has good optical absorption properties, there is a weak absorption in the range of about 500-600 nm, cosensitization can make up for the defect in this range well. After cosensitization, the effects on light-harvesting ability, photovoltaic performance and charge recombination were studied in detail. Obviously, the DSSC based on JP3 +JX2 showed excellent light response and a high PCE of 8.08%, which exhibited remarkable PCE improvements of 26% compared with the DSSC based on JP3 (6.40%).

The optimized efficiency of a tandem cell combined with both n- and p-type DSSCs was theoretically predicted to be 43%. The bottleneck for reaching the optimized performance is limited by the p-type half-cell, particularly the lacking of an appropriate semiconducting material as the photocathode. In this regard, we report the surfactant-mediated synthesis of nickel oxide nanomaterial using a chemical co-precipitation method. The new material was fully characterized by XRD, SEM, XPS, EDS, and BET. The BET result indicates the nickel oxide nanoparticles synthesized with surfactant attain higher surface area than the conventional one. In addition, the new organic dyes with electron-deficient diphenylquinoxaline incorporated within the molecular structure were prepared for p-type dye-sensitized solar cells with the newly prepared NiO as the photocathode. The new organic dyes consist of carboxylic acid as the anchoring group, triphenylamine as the electron donor, 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline as the auxiliary acceptor moiety, 2-methylenemalononitrile as electron acceptor, connected with thiophene, 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene, and 2,2'-bithiophene as the pi-spacer. Sensitizers with mono-anchoring group (EH166, EH122, and EH174) performed better than their corresponding double-anchoring sensitizers (EH162, EH126, and EH170). Among these, dye EH174 exhibited the best conversion efficiency up to 0.207% with a short-circuit photocurrent density of 4.84 mAcm(-2), an open-circuit photovoltage of 137 mV, and a fill factor of 0.312.

Performance enhancers were incorporated to the electrolyte to improve the efficiency in the DSSCs. Varying the salt mass fraction, showed that the conductivity in the electrolyte increases with increasing amount of RbI. The highest ionic conductivity of 4.19 mS cm(-1) is exhibited by the electrolyte sample with RbI: Hex(4)NI weight ratio of 3:1 at 25 degrees C. The temperature dependence of the electrolytes shows Arrhenius behavior. It is found that the electrolyte with RbI: Hex(4)NI weight ratio of 1.06:1 is more suitable for DSSC's applications and it has a conductivity of 3.77 mS cm(-1). A colloidal suspension of P25 TiO2 nanoparticles was used to make the spin coated photo-anodes in the form of stacks of 1-6 layers.

The effects of SAT microspheres and the gradient-ascent architecture on the light absorption and the photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were investigated. Studies indicate that the introduction of SAT microspheres and the gradient-ascent architecture in the photoanode significantly enhance the light scattering and harvesting capability of the photoanode. The DSSC with the optimized SAT gradient-ascent photoanode has the maximum short circuit current density (J(sc)) of 17.7 mA cm(-2) and PCE of 7.75%, remarkably higher than those of the conventional DSSC by 23.7% and 28.0%, respectively. This significantly enhancement of the performance of the DSSC can be attributed to the excellent light reflection/scattering of SAT, the localized surface plasma resonance (LSPR) effect of AuNPs within the microspheres, and the gradient-ascent architecture of SAT microspheres inside the photoanode. This study demonstrates that the tri-synergies of the scattering of SAT microspheres, the LSPR of AuNPs and the gradient-ascent architecture can effectively improve the PCE of DSSC.

A simple mechanochemical reaction has been developed and applied to prepare various edge-functionalized GnPs (EFGnPs). EFGnPs can be produced in a simple and ecofriendly manner by ball milling of graphite with target substances (X = nonmetals, halogens, semimetals, or metalloids). The unique feature of this method is its use of kinetic energy, which can generate active carbon species by unzipping of graphitic C-C bonds in dry conditions (no solvent). The active carbon species efficiently pick up X substance(s), leading to the formation of graphitic C-X bonds along the broken edges and the delamination of graphitic layers into EFGnPs. Unlike graphene oxide (GO) and reduced GO (rGO), the preparation of EFGnPs does not involve toxic chemicals, such as corrosive acids and toxic reducing agents. Furthermore, the prepared EFGnPs preserve high crystallinity in the basal area due to their edge-selective functionalization. Considering the available edge X groups that can be selectively employed, the potential applications of EFGnPs are unlimited.

The cells require a stable binding of the robust molecular chromophores, catalysts, and chromophore/catalyst assemblies on metal oxide semiconductor electrodes under the corresponding (photoelectro)chemical conditions.

Cyclic voltammetry measurements indicated that the porous carbon-cobalt electrode with small particle size (SPC-Co) exhibited better electrocatalytic performance than that with large particle size (LPC-Co), primarily owing to its larger electrocatalytic surface for boosting the redox reaction between iodide and triiodide ions.

The electronic structure indicates a high content of Mo4+ 3d5/2 and W(4+)4f7/2 with lower binding energy in the 2D composite, which is ascribed to partial loss of surface sulfur atoms in 2D composites and the newly formed heteroatomic bond of C Symbol of the Klingon Empire W Symbol of the Klingon Empire S and C Symbol of the Klingon Empire Mo Symbol of the Klingon Empire S.

Herein, four indoline sensitizers based on D--A--A construction were designed and synthesized with exactly the same donor and acceptor segments. Their molecular planarity was regulated by introducing various side chains into donor bridges. Interestingly, along with an improvement of planarity at a donor bridge, the HOMO levels of the dyes lift gradually, and more importantly, their LUMO levels remain at around the same value. Besides, better molecular planarity is obviously preferred to obtain higher charge injection efficiency but, an overly planar molecule may cause an overly high HOMO level, leading to poor dye regeneration efficiency. Furthermore, an appropriate side chain also restrains charge recombination to some extent, while an overly large side chain gives more chance for I-3(-) to recombine with charge in the conduction band. Accordingly, our results demonstrated that regulation of planarity at a donor bridge not only provides targeted and selective control of the HOMO of the dye, but also enable fine adjustment with multiple interfacial charge transfer processes.

It turns out that the calculations lead to the prediction of 15 new molecules with optimal performances and for which none so far has been studied. These porphyrin derivatives will in the near future be synthesized and subsequently tested experimentally. Our inverse-design approach, PooMa, is based on the strategy of providing suggestions for molecular systems with optimal properties. PooMa has been developed as a tool that requires minimal resources and, therefore, builds on various approximate methods. It uses genetic algorithm to screen thousands (or often more) of molecules. For each molecule, the density-functional tight-binding (DFTB) method is used for calculating the electronic properties. In the present work, five different electronic properties are determined, all of which are related to optical performance. Subsequently, a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model is constructed that can predict the PCE through those five electronic properties.

The obtained films are exploited as photoanodes for front-illuminated dye-sensitized solar cells. Compared with the close-ended TiO2 nanotube arrays (C-TNTAs) based device, the solar cell based on O-TNTAs yields an impressive solar power conversion efficiency of 7.7% under one sun illumination, corresponding to a 66% enhancement. The improved cell performance results from both the enhanced light-harvesting and promoted charge collection. The developed through-hole membranes are also favorable for many other potential applications, such as bioinfiltration, flow-through photocatalytical reactors, growth templates and sensors.

Through the formation of N...H hydrogen bonds between these nitrogen-rich heterocycle donors and 4-tert-butylbenzoic acid (PTBBA), the electron leak points (imine group (-N=)) may be plugged, thus blocking excited-state electron lateral transferring between the adsorbed dyes and electron leaking from electron-transporting channel into the electrolyte. Furthermore, the huge 3-dimensional sizes of such supramolecule sensitizers can not only suppress dye aggregation, but enhance the photoresponse capacity in visible region. Therefore, the devices based on NP-2@PTBBA and NP-3@PTBBA, which obtained by the cocktail sensitization procedures, can be improved by increasing the open-circuit photovoltage (V-oc) without any loss of the shortcircuit photocurrent density (J(sc)) owing to the synergy effect between self-assembly and co-sensitization. Although the device based on NP-3/PTBBA via the stepwise sensitization procedure delivers lower efficiency, it can remain at 103.14% of the initial efficiency as a result of parallel increase in J(sc) and V-oc values. Overall, the design principles provide a clear road map of supramolecular dye-sensitized solar cells (SDSSCs) and demonstrate the potential of 1,3,5-triazine-based dyes in solar cells research.

Here, five novel PMI dyes bearing carboxylic acid, phosphonic acid, acetylacetone, hydroxyquinoline or dipicolinic acid anchoring groups for attachment onto TiO2 are reported. We identified functional DSC and DSP systems with PMI-sensitised TiO2 in aqueous solution, which permitted a side-by-side comparison with respect to performance between the two systems. Structure-activity relationships allowed us to suggest anchor-condition-system associations to suit specific anchoring groups at various pH values, and with different electron mediators (redox couple or sacrificial electron donor) and catalysts in DSC and DSP schemes. A DSC sensitised with the hydroxyquinoline-modified PMI dye reached the highest short-circuit current density (J(SC) approximate to 1.4 mA cm(-2)) in aqueous electrolyte solution during irradiation with simulated solar light. This dye also achieved a turnover number (TONPMI) of approximately 4900 for sacrificial proton reduction after 24 h irradiation in a DSP scheme with Pt as a H-2-evolving co-catalyst at pH 4.5. This performance was only surpassed by the carboxylic acid-bearing dye, which reached a new benchmark turnover number (TONPMI approximate to 1.1 x 10(4) after 72 h) for an organic dye in nanoparticulate DSP for solar fuel production. At higher pH (8.5), our results showed that the phosphonic acid group allows for higher performance due to a stronger anchoring ability.

Despite the large number of existing computational studies of TiO2 clusters and in spite of the higher computing power of the typical available hardware, allowing for calculations of larger systems, there are still studies that use cluster sizes that are too small and not appropriate to address particular problems or certain complex systems relevant in photovoltaic or photocatalytic applications. By means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we attempt to find acceptable minimal sizes of the TinO2n+2H4 (n = 14, 24, 34, 44, 54) nanoclusters in correlation with the size of the adsorbed molecule and the rigidity of the backbone of the molecule to model systems and interface processes that occur in hybrid photovoltaics and photocatalysis. We illustrate various adsorption cases with a small rigid molecule based on coumarin, a larger rigid oligomethine cyanine dye with indol groups, and the penicillin V antibiotic having a flexible backbone. We find that the use of the n = 14 cluster to describe adsorption leads to significant distortions of both the cluster and the molecule and to unusual tridentate binding configurations not seen for larger clusters. Moreover, the significantly weaker bonding as well as the differences in the density of states and in the optical spectra suggest that the n = 14 cluster is a poor choice for simulating the materials used in the practical applications envisaged here. As the n = 24 cluster has provided mixed results, we argue that cluster sizes larger than or equal to n = 34 are necessary to provide the reliability required by photovoltaic and photocatalytic applications.

The light adsorption occurs in dye molecules adsorbed on a highly porous structure of TiO2 film.

One process, for which there is limited information, is the time taken to upload the dye on the TiO2 nanoporous film. The processes followed experimentally for dye uptake is by dipping the TiO2 semiconductor electrode into the dye solution for periods of several hours to several days. However, such long dipping times are not economical for industrial production of DSSCs. The factors controlling this process are not yet fully investigated. We propose a simple model based on the Langmuir isotherms to study and understand the diffusion and adsorption of the dye molecules in TiO2 films. Our computational modelling results show that the adsorption of dye into the TiO2 nanotubes film is controlled by the diffusion coefficient, the adsorption-desorption ratio and the initial dye concentration. Our results show that the initial dye concentration plays an important role on the surface coverage.

CNF/WO3/TiO2 nanosemiconductors can be used as photoanodes in DSSCs. It has been indicated that CNF/WO3/TiO2 is a promising alternative to standard DSSCs due to their highly porous surface area and perfect optoelectronic properties. The uses of CNF/WO3/TiO2 hybrid structures provided an improvement to the performance of devices. DSSCs based on CNF/WO3/TiO2 hybrid structures exhibited a power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.28%. It was shown that enhanced light absorption prevents recombination and the perfect accord work function of the hybrid structures gives a high solar conversion efficiency. The enhancements of the PCE in DSSCs originate from the increase in photovoltage with the improvement of the fill factor (FF). The increase in Voc was caused by the increase in the dye adsorption on the substrate and the enhancement of FF which was attributed to faster electron transportation on the devices. It was shown that the CNF/WO3/TiO2 nanostructures had large surface areas, highly nanoporous structures (below 20 nm), and excellent work functions between CNF/WO3 nanoparticles and TiO2 anatase. It was also demonstrated that the new material CNF/WO3/TiO2 nanostructures displayed a wide scan scale photon absorption and exhibited the highest photovoltaic performance.

The trap-limited diffusion of charges in the semiconductor prevented photoanodes from having thickness greater than 15 mu m, thus limiting the potential of DSSC. This is especially with more recent research moving away from iodine-based electrolyte that requires a thicker photoanode. Thicker photoanodes means higher potential efficiency due to better light harvesting without resorting to scattering or reflecting layers to trap light as with thin photoanodes. Graphene had been added to TiO2 photoanodes in other research but in the form of rGO and suffered from increasing electron recombination at higher concentration. In this study, shear-exfoliated graphene was successfully incorporated into TiO2 nanofibers via electrospinning to produce fiber with diameter 52-73 nut in the photoanode with graphene in roll-up form inside the nanofibers eliminating edge effect of 2D graphene sheet that causes electron recombination. The nanofiber-based photo anode showed significantly longer electron diffusion length with little impact on recombination, primary due to higher electron diffusion coefficient. As a result, a thicker optimal photoanode, 23 mu m, can be obtained with device efficiency measured at 8.9%, which is 22% higher than that without graphene with optimal thickness of 13 mu m. The graphene also showed no interference in dye loading density of N719 dye.

The obtained solar cell conversion efficiency was about 1.8% with fill factor 53% using an irradiation of 100 mW/cm(2) at 25 degrees C. The prepared DSSC is not only stable but also eco friendly due to use of natural polymer and dye.

The fluorescence emission can be linearly enhanced or inhibited by a PC as a result of the photonic bandgap coupling with the excitation light and/or emission light.

The addition of Li-EDA promotes the selective reduction of the rutile phase of TiO2 into the amorphous phase keeping anatase phase unaltered. Hence, the phase-selective reduction of TiO2 leads to the formation of blue TiO2 nanoparticles. Synthesized samples were characterized by equipment fitted with modern technology. The shifting of (101) peak to a lower angle (2 theta) in Cr-BTiO2 in X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern suggests the successful doping of chromium into TiO2 lattices. In Raman spectra, the shifting of the active Eg peak of Cr-BTiO2 nanoparticles to higher wavenumber also suggests the successful substitution of Ti by Cr. The blue TiO2 and Cr-BTiO2 show increased absorption of light in the visible region compared to TiO2 (P25). The modified TiO2 samples have improved electron-hole separation tendency as predicted by the photoluminescence spectra (PL). Also, doping of Cr- into TiO2 lattice results the formation of oxygen vacancy as detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Among all samples, Cr-BTiO2 demonstrated improvement in J(sc) and overall incident photon to current conversion efficiency.

Despite of faster electron injection from sensitizer C343 to TiO2 than ZnO, the later shows a better photovoltaic efficiency. The higher photocurrent in C343-ZnO has been mechanistically justified by slower back electron recombination and higher dye loading obtained from open circuit potential decay, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and absorption spectra of the sensitized photoanodes. The similar positive features are there for N719-ZnO system also. Still TiO2-N719 performs much better than ZnO-N719 in terms of device efficiency. We have found a signature of H-type aggregate formation of N719 dye on the ZnO photoanode surface which shows a higher energy absorption peak than the monomeric form of the dye in the diffuse reflectance mode absorption spectra of the photoanodes. These type of aggregates are unable to inject electrons into the semiconductor rather the dye aggregates can pull back the electrons from the CB of the ZnO and eventually undergoes ground state recombination.

The series resistance is gradually reduced with increased Ni3S4 film thickness, indicating the metallic conduction of the Ni3S4 phase. The Ni3S4 deposited for 8 cycles (denoted FTO/Ni3S4-8) exhibits full coverage on the FTO substrate, with 110 nm thickness and a distinctive structure of porous and nanoscale interconnecting nanoparticular networks, which provide numerous electrochemical active sites to contact with electrolyte. The film not only exhibits prominent electrocatalytic activities but also shows excellent electrochemical stability in both polysulfide and iodide-based electrolytes compared to FTO/Pt. On the contrary, the FTO/Ni3S4-10 shows merged clusters, leading to more compact and less porous morphology, which reduced electrocatalytic activity.

Upon photon absorption by a SF molecule, the initially created singlet excited state (S-1) interacts with a neighboring chromophore and is first transformed into a triplet pair (TT), which can be subsequently separated into independent triplet excitons (2T(1)). These independent triplet excitons can be harvested through triplet charge extraction or triplet energy transfer to an acceptor. Research on SF systems has revealed rates and efficiencies of triplet formation and triplet pair decorrelation that are strongly dependent on interchromophore coupling, which is dictated by molecular structure and the resulting geometrical arrangement of chromophores adopted in covalent (e.g., dimers) and noncovalent (e.g., films and crystals) systems. Incorporation of SF materials into realistic device architectures introduces a host of new challenges to consider regarding the efficient extraction of triplets generated through SF.

To this end, two dithiafulvene-based organic sensitizers with different molecular shapes were synthesized, and the influence of their aggregation on TiO2 on the various performance parameters of DSCs was investigated. It was found that V-shaped DTF-C5, with a larger flare angle of 150.6 degrees between the donor and acceptor units in the molecular structure, tended to form compact aggregates on the surface of TiO2 without the loss of adsorbed dyes, thus giving a higher short-circuit density (J(sc)) of 14.92 mA cm(-2) and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.39%; these values were 1.48 and 1.53 times higher than those of a DSC with a CDCA co-adsorbent, respectively.

Compared to a DSC with pristine DTF-C6 aggregation, an example based on the co-adsorbed system dramatically raised the PCE from 5.50% to 9.04%, owing to the improved J(sc) and open-circuit voltage values.

The size of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles is about 3 nm, and the influence of CoFe2O4 on the electrochemical properties of graphene is studied. The CoFe2O4 nanoparticles anchored on graphene nanosheets can serve as spacers to prevent graphene aggregations and thereby provide efficient diffusion pathways and more active surface area for electrolyte molecules. Also, the CoFe2O4 nanoparticles with substantial catalytic activity accelerate the reduction of triiodide. Meanwhile the graphene improves charge transfer during the catalytic process. Compared with CoFe2O4, graphene, and Pt electrodes, the CoFe2O4/GN electrode displays higher catalytic activity because of its minimal charge transfer resistance. The DSSCs fabricated with CoFe2O4/GN demonstrate an improved photoelectric conversion efficiency of 9.04% in comparison to Pt electrodes (6.54%). This study suggests that CoFe2O4/GN can replace expensive Pt electrodes for large-scale fabrication of low cost and high efficiency DSSCs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The organic dyes LEG4 and MKA253 were selected as sensitizers. A Stern-Volmer plot of LEG4-sensitized TiO2 substrates with a spin-coated [Ru(bpy)(3)(PF6)(2)] layer on top shows considerable quenching of the emission of the latter. Interestingly, time-resolved emission spectroscopy reveals the presence of a fast-decay time component (25 +/- 5 ns), which is absent when the anatase TiO2 semiconductor is replaced by ZrO2. It should be specified that the positive redox potential of the ruthenium complex prevents electron transfer from the [Ru(bpy)(3)(PF6)(2)] ground state into the oxidized sensitizer. Therefore, we speculate that the fast-decay time component observed stems from excited-state electron transfer from [Ru(bpy)(3)(PF6)(2)] to the oxidized sensitizer.

The DMA-II can be co-adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface with the dye molecules due to the presence of a carboxy group, and the coadsorption can thus reduce the dye aggregation. Moreover, the I- species existing in the coadsorbent are close to the dye molecules, which is favorable for fast dye regeneration and hence photocurrent generation. As compared to the typically used co-adsorbent, deoxycholic acid (DCA) that does not contain iodide, the DMA-II co-adsorbent enhances the electron lifetime and electron collection yield significantly, because the iodide in the co-adsorbent can quickly reduce the dye cation formed upon electron injection to its original neutral state. As a result, the DMA-II co-adsorbent (1 mM) achieves a power conversion efficiency of 8.97% for quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells under AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm(-2)) illumination, which is higher than that (7.35%) without co-adsorption and outperforms DCA co-adsorption at 1 mM (7.81%) and at 20 mM (8.24%).

An insight from a theoretical perspective,JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A,,,,,,,,,,,,"The main goal of this work is to clearly answer the question from a theoretical perspective: how does graphene enhance the photoelectric conversion efficiency in the semiconducting layer of a dye sensitized solar cell? Several arrangements of the graphene layer between the dye molecule and the TiO2 (101) surface are carefully studied and discussed. The dynamic interfacial electron propagations are simulated with consideration of the underlying nuclear motion effect. Theoretical investigation shows that graphene can speed up the electron injection from the dye molecules to the semiconductor layer, only when the graphene sheet is bonded to the TiO2 surface via C-Ti bonds. The excited electrons of the dye molecules on the graphene sheet will be rapidly injected into the semiconducting layer. Additionally, if the graphene sheet is parallel to the TiO2 surface, the free electrons on graphene can only hop onto the TiO2 surface in a relatively long tunneling period. Therefore, graphene in this case mainly plays the role of a shielding layer for preventing the recombination of the electrons injected into TiO2 and the electron holes remaining on the dye molecules or in the electrolyte. The combination of these two mechanisms indicates that graphene layers in the proper conformation can effectively improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency of a dye sensitized solar cell.",,,,"Eglitis, Roberts/A-6014-2012; Wang, Abbott/S-2880-2019","Wang, Abbott/0000-0003-4670-7741; Li, Wei/0000-0002-9999-5081; Jia, Ran/0000-0002-3722-1195; Bai, Fu-Quan/0000-0001-9398-1407",,,,,,,,,,,,2050-7488,2050-7496,,,,14-Feb,2019,7,6,,,,,2730,2740,,10.1039/c8ta06872k,,,,,,,,WOS:000457893400034,,,,,

Herein, we synthesize four novel porphyrin dyes, XW36 XW39, using an N-phenyl-substituted phenothiazine donor to pursue higher PCE. For XW36 and XW37, the N-phenyl group is wrapped with two ortho-alkoxy chains. In contrast, it is substituted with a para-alkoxy group in XW38 and XW39. The phenothiazine wrapping in XW36 and XW37 induces more serious distortion, which is beneficial for anti-aggregation but unfavorable for the electron transfer from donor to a porphyrin framework. Thus, individual porphyrin dyes XW36 and XW37 exhibit efficiencies of 9.05 and 9.58%, respectively, lower than those of 9.51 and 10.0% achieved for XW38 and XW39, respectively. Besides, the introduction of a methyl group into a benzoic acid acceptor unit is conducive to anti-aggregation and thus improves the V-oc and efficiencies. Therefore, higher efficiencies were achieved for XW37 and XW39, compared with XW36 and XW38, respectively. Interestingly, although the individual XW36 dye shows a lowest efficiency among the four dyes, a highest efficiency of 11.7% was obtained for XW36 on the basis of synergetic adsorption with chenodeoxycholic acid and PT-C6 because of simultaneously improved J and Voc, which may be ascribed to the lowest dye-loading amount of XW36 among all of these porphyrin dyes, with the largest vacancy area left on the TiO2 surface available for cosensitizer PT-C6, resulting in a highest J. The high efficiency of 11.7% is one of the highest efficiencies using I-/I-3(-) electrolytes in DSSCs. These results provide an effective strategy for developing efficient DSSCs by the targeted coadsorption and cosensitization of porphyrin sensitizers optimized through introducing a bis(ortho-alkoxy)-wrapped phenyl group into the phenothiazine donor and/or methyl groups into the benzoic acid acceptor unit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1944-8244,,,,,6-Feb,2019,11,5,,,,,5046,5054,,10.1021/acsami.8b19077,,,,,,,,WOS:000458347900036,30644719,,,,

This review considers local measurement techniques aiding in the design of efficient oxide systems for the utilization of light as energy source and as efficient detection principle. Artificial photoelectrochemical systems are often build on oxides as they are abundant and have semiconducting properties. However, no single oxide fulfills all requirements for an efficient conversion of sunlight to chemical energy and thus complex oxides are explored. These oxides might be obtained by doping oxides with other metal cations or by combining different oxides for absorbance and catalyzing the desired reaction, mainly water splitting. Due to the enormous amount of possible combinations combinatorial search for new material systems has been pursued and accelerated around the world making use of local photoelectrochemical characterization techniques in the screening step. Local detection schemes based on scanning electrochemical microscopy and scanning electrochemical cell microscopy also provide details about the kinetics for heterogeneous charge transfer and the release of soluble reaction products. During the recent years the scanning probe methods have been complemented by local detection of fluorescent reaction products that are formed by heterogeneous electron transfer reactions from and non-fluorescent precursor molecules. Such detection is possible with single molecule sensitivity and spatial resolution exceeding the diffraction limit (superresolution). Such approaches enabled the discovery of population within ensembles of metal oxide nanoparticles that are distinguished by the location and reactivity of their reaction sites.

The effect of the Co/Ni ratio on the photovoltaic performance of dye-sensitized solar cells has been systematically studied, and it has been found that dye-sensitized solar cells based on Co-Ni-Se counter electrodes display impressive photovoltaic performance. The best power conversion efficiency of 7.38% was achieved under AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm(-2)) illumination for the dye-sensitized solar cells based on Co-Ni-Se-1:1 counter electrode, which was higher than that of the dye-sensitized solar cells with Pt counter electrode (6.73%).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0038-092X,,,,,FEB,2019,179,,,,,,59,66,,10.1016/j.solener.2018.12.037,,,,,,,,WOS:000458942300007,,,,,

The thin films were prepared by sol-gel method using spin-coating technique annealed at 400, 450, 500, 550, and 600 degrees C. Morphology transition of In2O3 from spherical to cubic and then octahedral structure occurred as the annealing temperature rises. The photoanode annealed at 450 degrees C (cubic structure) provides a stable phase of cubic structure with large surface area and optimum thickness for effective dye adsorption. However, the IPCE value does not solely depends on the dye adsorption of photoanodes (light harvesting efficiency (LHE)) but the electron injection efficiency ((inj)) and the collection efficiency ((coll)). Smaller energy bandgap of photoanodes favors the injected electrons with higher driving force to the conduction band (CB) of the photoanode, which in turn increases the (inj) from the LUMO of dye to the In2O3-SWCNTs CB. Besides that, the absence of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) above 500 degrees C caused the energy bandgap to increase and leads to lower driving force of injected electrons. In addition, SWCNTs are capable of absorbing visible light faster than other materials. Therefore, the cubic structure-based photoanode (450 degrees C) exhibited better electron transport with larger driving force on injected electron ((inj)) that decreased the electron recombination rate and increased electron lifetime and subsequently obtained larger charge collection efficiency ((coll)) of almost 99%.

Finally, FD and SD-based cells without CDCA achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 7.20% and 7.47%, respectively, in liquid DSSCs. Correspondingly, FD and SD displayed PCE values of 5.77% and 6.67% in quasi-solid-state DSSCs, respectively, under standard global 1.5 solar conditions. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

It is interesting that the ratio of the two components of quasi-solid-state electrolyte can be tuned to shift the position of TiO2 conduction band edge, which can obviously enhance the driving force of electron injection process. Consequently, compared with the liquid electrolyte based dye-sensitized solar cell DSSC, the short-circuit current density (J(sc)) of solar cellassembled by this quasi-solid-state electrolyte is increased about 12%. Moreover, the intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy/intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are carried out to investigate the influences of gelation on the kinetic processes of electron transport and recombination in DSSC. It is found that with the increasing of valine, the 3D network of quasi-solid-state electrolyte becomes looser and the electron transportation process is accelerated, meanwhile, the electron recombination lifetime is prolonged. As result, the quasi-solid-state solar cells (QS-DSSCs) employed with the bicomponent quasi-solid-state electrolytes obtained a higher efficiency of 6.1% at AM 1.5 (100 mW cm(2)), but the efficiency of QS-DSSC based on the unitary component quasi-solid-state electrolyte formed by bisamide is only 5.3%.

In this study, we present a novel strategy that uses ultra-broadband core-shell Ag@TiO2 nanoparticles and mesoporous TiO2 particles to improve light absorption and reduce charge recombination in DSCs. The effect of the concentration of nanoparticles on both photovoltaic performance and charge recombination is studied. The results show that Ag@TiO2 nanoparticles can significantly improve the short-circuit current of DSCs and reduce the charge-transfer resistance at the TiO2-dye/electrolyte interface. These are key factors to achieve high power-conversion efficiency. A power-conversion efficiency of 8.34% is achieved by integrating core-shell NPs (0.6 wt%) with pure P25 TiO2 particles. This efficiency can be improved further (to 10.02%) by depositing a layer of mesoporous TiO2 particles, which increases the propagation distance of incoming light. The good interconnection between the TiO2 crystals of mesoporous particles and the faceted nanocrystal surface enhance electron transport.

In this work, we perform a detailed theoretical search for high-efficiency D-pi-A organic dyes using density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory calculations. Specifically, we perform geometric optimization, and electronic structure and absorption spectra calculations for isolated dyes for two thieno[3,2-b]benzothiophene pi-spacer-based D-pi -A organic dyes SGT129 and SGT130, which show significant efficiency difference, before and after binding to a TiO2 semiconductor. The calculation results reveal that the coplanar configuration between the electron donor and the pi-spacer can enhance electronic communication efficiently, thus facilitating intra-molecular charge transfer from the electron donor to the acceptor groups in SGT130. The absorption spectrum of SGT130 broadens and is red-shifted owing to the decreased bandgap. The higher light-harvesting efficiency, favorable intra-molecular charge transfer, larger shift of the conduction band edge in the TiO2 semiconductor, and slower charge recombination between the injected electrons in the TiO2 conduction band and the electrolyte explain the superior efficiency of SGT130 over that of SGT129. Using SGT130 as the reference dye, we further design four novel dyes 1-4 by modifying the pi-spacer with electron-rich and electron-withdrawing moieties. Judging from the theoretical parameters influencing the short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage, we found that all dyes would perform better than SGT130 in terms of the favorable interfacial charge transfer (ICT) and light-harvesting efficiency, as well as the larger shift of the TiO2 conduction band edge.

The three-dimensional hierarchical NP-MS structure supplied a strong light scattering capability and good connectivity. Thus, the hierarchical NP-MS combined the beneficial properties of improved scattering capability, dye loading ability, electron transport and inhibited charge recombination.

However, the charge transfer kinetics mediated by its surface state remains unclear. Here, the charge transfer mechanism of Cs2SnI6 is reported and the role of its surface state in the presence of a redox mediator is clarified. Specifically, charge transfer through the surface state of Cs2SnI6 and its subsequent surface state charging are demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry and Mott-Schottky measurements, respectively. Because it is expected that the surface state of Cs2SnI6 is capable of regenerating oxidized organic dyes, a Cs2SnI6-based regenerator is developed for a dye-sensitized solar cell composed of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/dyed mesoporous TiO2/regenerator/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/FTO. As expected, the performance of the Cs2SnI6-based regenerator is strongly dependent on the highest occupied molecular orbital of the dyes. Consequently, Cs2SnI6 shows efficient charge transfer with a thermodynamically favorable charge acceptor level, achieving a 79% enhancement in the photocurrent density (14.1 mA cm(-2)) compared with that of a conventional liquid electrolyte (7.9 mA cm(-2)). The results suggest that the surface state of Cs2SnI6 is the main charge transfer pathway in the presence of a redox mediator and should be considered in future designs of Cs2SnI6-based devices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1614-6832,1614-6840,,,,17-Jan,2019,9,3,,,,,,,1803243,10.1002/aenm.201803243,,,,,,,,WOS:000456215200007,,,,,

However, the use of rare metals such as Pt counter electrodes (CEs) is one of the major drawbacks of DSSC devices for broad real-life applications. In this regard, alternative materials to Pt CEs have been long sought for DSSCs employing both cobalt and iodine redox couples. Therefore, in this study, soft-templated tellurium-doped mesoporous carbons (Te-SMCs) were synthesized for the first time by the simple pyrolysis of PAN-b-PBA block copolymer in the presence of a tellurium precursor for replacing the Pt CE. To confirm the chemical composition and porosity, the as-prepared Te-SMC materials were evaluated by elemental analysis (XPS and EDS) and nitrogen sorption isotherms measurement. The as-prepared Te-SMC materials contained mainly mesopores and retained the three-dimensional hierarchical graphite-like structure with many defect sites. They displayed doping levels with nitrogen of 9.15 atom % and tellurium of 0.15 atom % and had a specific surface area of 540 m(2) g(-1). Therefore, these characteristics enabled the development of a high-performance CE in DSSCs with cobalt and iodine redox couples. As a result of its catalytic performance, Te-SMC exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic activity as well as a significantly improved electrochemical stability than those of Pt CE for both redox couples even after 1000 potential cycles. The results show that a maximum conversion efficiency of 11.64 and 9.67% could be achieved under one sun illumination (AM 1.5G) for SGT-021/Co(bpy)(3)(2+/3+)- and N719/I-/I-3(-)-based devices with Te-SMC CEs, and their power conversion efficiency is superior to the corresponding device with Pt CEs.",,,,"Matyjaszewski, Krzysztof/A-2508-2008; Kowalewski, Tomasz/B-6785-2016","Matyjaszewski, Krzysztof/0000-0003-1960-3402; Kim, Hwan Kyu/0000-0002-6189-5237; Kowalewski, Tomasz/0000-0002-3544-554X",,,,,,,,,,,,1944-8244,1944-8252,,,,16-Jan,2019,11,2,,,,,2093,2102,,10.1021/acsami.8b19223,,,,,,,,WOS:000456351100039,30576097,,,,

However, the ultraviolet (UV) light component of sunlight is not effectively harvested by these dye molecules. Thus, for inherent improvement of DSSC photovoltaic performance, effective UV light harvesting is necessary. To achieve this, we here attempt to synthesize down-converting phosphor particles, which can convert UV light to visible light. In this work, we fabricate CaAl2O4:Eu2+, Nd3+ phosphor particles using a simple and viable aerosol process in the gas phase; then, we investigate the role of these phosphor particles as a down-converting medium in DSSC photoelectrodes. The presence of Eu2+ and Nd3+ is observed in a CaAl2O4 matrix fabricated at a spray pyrolysis temperature of 850 degrees C with a subsequent H-2 reduction temperature of similar to 1120 degrees C. This finding indicates that those conditions are optimized for formation of these components with the strongest emission spectrum peak at 440 nm, corresponding to blue light. To examine the effect of the CaAl2O4:Eu2+, Nd3+ phosphor particles on the DSSC photovoltaic performance, various amounts of CaAl2O4:Eu2+, Nd3+ phosphor particles are added to the TiO2 matrixes in the DSSC photoelectrodes. Hence, the short-circuit current density and power conversion efficiency are found to increase with increasing CaAl2O4:Eu2+, Nd3+ phosphor particle content (<= 5 wt%) in the TiO2 matrix. This suggests that addition of a critical amount of CaAl2O4:Eu2+, Nd3+ phosphor particles can enhance the DSSC light harvesting efficiency by effectively down-converting UV light from irradiating sunlight into additional visible light.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0038-092X,,,,,15-Jan,2019,178,,,,,,173,180,,10.1016/j.solener.2018.12.029,,,,,,,,WOS:000457663800020,,,,,

X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies revealed that the degree of crystallinity of the overall GPE reaches the minimum at 4 wt.% of Ni-3(PO4)(2) nanoparticles. The amorphous domains have boosted the mobility of the charge carriers and successfully increased the ionic conductivity from 2.27 mS cm(-1) to 3.75 mS cm(-1). Temperature dependence studies affirmed that the GPEs obey Arrhenius behavior in which ion hopping mechanism is dominant. This explanation was further corroborated by the results obtained from electrical modulus studies. The addition of Ni-3(PO4)(2) also increases both the dielectric constant and dielectric loss dramatically. Fourier transform infrared studies proved the complexation of different components found in the polymer electrolyte.

It is found that the catalytic activity of Co0.85Se is closely dependent on the crystallinity. Moreover, the reactivity pathway is identified by density functional theory, which confirms that triiodide is reduced to iodide ion on Co0.85Se with a smaller energy barrier (similar to 0.65 eV) than on Pt (similar to 1.18 eV).

Lossy ""wheel-like"" metasurface is proposed for wideband absorption. Origin of dissipation, loss features and contributions of each part in the absorber are analyzed thoroughly to reveal the absorption mechanisms. Based on the electromagnetic responses, an equivalent circuit model is established and analyzed as a practical design method for general Window-use Microwave Absorbers (WMAs). Using the method, design feasibility of WMAs can be anticipated. WMAs with adjustable single-band, dual-band or broadband absorptions can be effectively realized. Evidenced by experimental measurements, the largescale-WMA can achieve 90% absorption in 6-16.5 GHz, which is in great agreement with simulated results. In addition, the WMA can also maintain high absorption regardless of incident angles. Even through it is bent into curvature, the flexible WMA can still operate well in a wide band, which indicates the WMA is promising for applications in nonplanar situations. Evaluated in imitating usage scenario, efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) decreases only a little after having the WMA put on because of its high optical transparency. The WMA has advanced comprehensive performances. The equivalent circuit model is also proved of high reliability. (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To engineer these devices for better performance, research has centered around suppressing charge recombination at the semiconductor-sensitizer interface and developing better catalysts for water oxidation. Yet it remains quantitatively unknown how much DSPECs can benefit from these improvements. We use a simplified photoanode process to model the charge transport dynamics in DSPECs under surface reaction-limiting conditions. By combining intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and numerical simulations, we explore in detail how electron transport and recombination rates as well as the sensitizer regeneration rate affect the steady-state photocurrent and the charge carrier concentration distribution. Numerical simulations confirm that fast electron diffusion in the semiconductor, a slow interfacial charge recombination rate, and rapid catalysis of water oxidation can improve the incident-photon-to-current-efficiency of DSPECs. The benefit, however, is largely compromised by the low charge injection efficiency, a problem that has not yet been fully appreciated.

Polyoxometalates (POMs), a kind of molecular inorganic quasi-semiconductor, are promising candidates for use in different parts of DSSCs due to their excellent photosensitivity, redox, and catalytic properties, as well as their relative stability. Following a brief introduction to the development of DSSCs and the potential virtues of POMs in DSSCs, we attempt to make some generalizations about the energy level regulation of POMs that is the underlying theoretical basis for their application in DSSCs, and then we summarize the research progress of POMs in DSSCs in recent years. This is organized in terms of the properties of POMs, namely, electron acceptor, photosensitivity, redox and catalysis, based on the accumulation of our research into POMs over many years. Meanwhile, in view of the fact that the properties of POMs depend primarily on their electronic structural diversity, we keep this point in mind throughout the article with a view to revealing their structure-property relationships.

The resulting radical fragments formed intra-molecular products and subsequently yielded five- and six-membered cyclized products depending on the type of aryl groups.

Generally, the DSSC is composed of photoanode, electrolyte and counter electrode. At present, platinum (Pt) film delivers the highest photoelectric conversion efficiency in the available counter electrode materials. However, Pt film is very expensive and prepared by relatively complicated and high-cost magnetron sputtering, which seriously hinders the large-scale applications in DSSC. Therefore, it is of highly academic and engineering significance to develop novel counter electrode materials with low cost and high photoelectric conversion efficiency to replace expensive Pt counter electrode. Previous research shows that carbon-based nanomaterials such as graphene and carbon nanotubes and promising to be used as highly efficient counter electrode materials. However, the high-cost and complicated fabrication process restrict their practical applications in DSSC. To address such issues, here in this work, we present and fabricate a highly efficient and low-cost three-dimensional porous carbon composite, which is constructed by the relatively dense and conductive graphite film as bottom layer (PC layer), and the porous carbon nanoparticle film as top layer (CC layer). Our fabricated DSSC consists of commercial TiO(2 )photoanode (4 mm x 4 mm), and PC, CC, CC/PC composite, or Pt counter electrode with a size of 8 mm x 8 mm. The results show that under illumination (100 mW/cm(2)) provided by a solar simulator, the short circuit current densities (open circuit voltages) of DSSCs with PC, CC, CC/PC, and Pt counter electrodes are 11.45 mA/cm(2) (0.72 V), 11.88 mA/cm(2) (0.73 V), 12.00 mA/cm(2) (0.75 V), and 13.46 mA/cm(2) (0.74 V), respectively. The filling factors of DSSCs with PC, CC, and CC/PC are 56.09%, 59.80%, 65.28%, and 62.69%, respectively; the photoelectric conversion efficiencies of DSSCs with PC, CC, and CC/PC are 4.61%, 5.20%, 5.90%, and 6.26%, respectively. It is noted that compared with CC layer or PC layer counter electrode, the CC/PC counter electrode delivers better photovoltaic performance. Particularly, the filling factor of DSSC with CC/PC (65.28%) is even 4.10% higher than that of DSSC with commercial Pt (62.69%), and the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the CC/PC-based DSSC is as large as 5.90%, which reaches 94.2% of the Pt-based DSSC (6.26%). The excellent performance of DSSC with CC/PC counter electrode is attributed to the unique three-dimensional porous structure, which can not only facilitate the transfer of electrons and ions, but also provide abundant catalytic sites; these synergistic effects greatly enhance the photovoltaic conversion performance of CC/PC-based DSSC.",,,,"Chen, Yuanfu/S-1753-2019",,,,,,,,,,,,,1000-3290,,,,,5-Jan,2019,68,1,,,,,,,17802,10.7498/aps.68.20181833,,,,,,,,WOS:000455408900019,,,,,

Three bis(4-pyridyl) alkanes - bis(4-pyridyl)butane L4, bis(4-pyridyl) octane L8 and bis(4-pyridyl) decane L10 were synthesized. These bis(4-pyridyl) alkane ligands are axially attached to the metallic center of synthesized porphyrin dye P.

The performance of these cells were compared with a reference cell which was prepared from porphyrin dye P only.

The problem of DSSC-based natural dyes is the lower efficiency than silicon solar cells. This low efficiency is due to the barrier of electron transfer in the TiO2 semiconductor layer. In this study, the addition of clathrin protein to the TiO2 layer was used to increase electron transfer in the semiconductor layer resulting in improved DSSC performance. Clathrin is a protein that plays a role in the formation of transport vesicle membrane in eukaryotic cells. The method used in this study is clathrin protein with a concentration of 0%, 25%, 50%, and 75% added to TiO2 in DSSC structure. Photovoltaic characteristics of DSSC were measured using a data logger to determine the performance of DSSC, layer morphology was analyzed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), the element content in DSSC was analyzed using Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), and functional groups in DSSC layers were analyzed using Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR).

Current-voltage characterization was performed to observe the changes in efficiency, fill factor, short circuit current density and open circuit voltage for both unsealed and sealed DSSCs for aging time up to 336 h. Findings The unsealed DSSC showed significant drop in efficiency from 4.26 to 2.42 per cent within the first 5.5 h of aging time because of the leakage and volatilization of the solvent in the electrolyte. On the other hand, the sealed DSSC exhibited a gradual improvement of efficiency from 4.16 to 4.73 per cent after the first 216 h of aging time. The initial efficiency increment can be ascribed to the improved adsorption of electrolyte into the titanium dioxide film because of the gradual desorption of excess dye from TiO2 with increasing aging time.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to investigate the surface morphology and the thickness changes of the films before and after treating. Electrical conductivity of the pristine and that of the treated films were calculated and compared, using sheet resistance and thickness, and the result was discussed based on X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. Finally, PEDOT:PSS films were used as counter electrodes of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The catalytic activity of the PEDOT:PSS films toward I-3(-) reduction reaction was characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs assembled by the films was evaluated under the irradiation of simulated AM 1.5G condition. The results demonstrate that, the amorphous PEDOT:PSS films are uniformly coated on FTO substrates after screen printing, and the surface morphology of PEDOT:PSS experiences significant change after the modification by post-treatment, with significantly decreased thickness and slightly increased roughness. The electrical conductivity has been enhanced to more than three times of that in the pristine film, due to the partial removal of PSS rather than the improvement of crystallinity. The catalytic activity toward I-3(-) reduction reaction is greatly enhanced, and the photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs assembled is also obviously improved, with the photo conversion efficiency increases from 5.12% to 6.64%.

These dyes, including K8 and N3, are based on a common motif formed by Ru center, N=C=S, and polypyridyl ligands, but differ only by the nature of the added group in para position of each pyridyl. The presence of these ligands will enable the evaluation of the electronic effects +/- 1 and +/- M. This work focuses on the localization of the part, among the metal, the -N=C=S, the polypyridyl ligands, and the added group R, which is most actively involved in the photocatalysis process. We dealt with both ground and excited states as well as the electronic transitions between them. To illustrate the effect of each functional group R on its photophysical properties, the geometries of five dyes were optimized in the molecular and univalent cationic states. All molecules are asymmetrical in shape with a distorted octahedral coordination of the RuN6 core. Atomic charge and spin density distributions show that a charge transfer process occurs from the NCS/Ru to polypyridyl ligand. Analysis of the electronic absorption spectra reveals that the band with the highest wavelength value is assigned to metal-to-ligand charge transfer transition. On the contrary, two other bands are assigned to multi-transitions Ru/NCS to polypyridyl-pi*. These attributions have been confirmed by the localization of all atoms intervening in them. We also introduced an adapted way to estimate the ionization probability values in each atomic center in the ground and first excited states. Phenomenal properties such as mobility, redox potential, electronic spectrum, ionization potential, and optical gap of the most efficient dye, which is the N3, fit well with experimental values.

While silicon-based solar cells are mostly rigid or can in the meantime also be prepared in the shape of relatively flexible foils, the approach to integrate solar cell functionality into a textile fabric goes one step further. In this case, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), polymer or organic solar cells are advantageous.

The electronic absorption and fluorescence spectral properties of complexes 4 and 5 are investigated. The effects of the triazole group, different metal centers and position of the substituent on the photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of the new phthalocyanines were also investigated for the first time in this work. According to the fluorescence measurements, the axially substituted silicon complex (5) showed higher fluorescence quantum yield (phi(F) = 0.28) than the peripherally substituted zinc complex (4). In addition, quantum yields for singlet oxygen generation (phi = 0.32 for silicon complex (4) and phi = 0.76 for zinc complex (5) in DMSO) were obtained. Electrochemical studies show that complex 5 is present in non-aggregated form as a result of steric hindrance of the axial groups; the LUMO level of this complex is slightly more negative than the conduction band of TiO2 and electron injection might be less effective. Therefore, the power conversion efficiency of 1.30% for a complex 4 based dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is higher than complex 5 (0.90%).

In both trans and cis conformers, a gradual increase in electron-donating strength promoted the natural charge separation between donor and acceptor moieties, thereby allowing the absorption of a longer wavelength of visible light.

To enhance the efficiency of this type of solar cells by means of the effect of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), we produced gold nanorods (GNRs) with an aspect ratio (a.r.) equal to 3:1 and tos 4:1. With an actual window application in mind, and mainly to prevent corrosion by the redox mediator in the cell, we considered the capping of GNRs before introducing them into the titanium oxide (TiO2) layer of the anode. in particular, we made a double-capping with silica and titania layers for a limited total thickness (i.e., about 6 nm), while still allowing a significant localized LSPR effect despite the increased distance between gold and dye molecules. We documented the different transformations in dimensions of the two types of capped gold nanorods (c-GNRs) due to the effect of sintering. Our aim was to evaluate the influence that these transformations would have on the photovoltaic performances of DSSCs. Methods: We added c-GNRs with a ratio of 2% in w/w to a transparent semiconductor paste, which was doctor bladed on the photoanodes of the co-sensitized solar cells made with commercially available organic sensitizers (L1 or L0) and the squaraine SQ2, which acted as a co-sensitizer. The films had a thickness of about 6 mu m and were sintered at 450 degrees C. We used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis to document the transformations, absorbance and absorptance spectra in order to control the effects of these modifications, and transmittance spectra for evaluating the see-through effects. We performed current-voltage, external quantum efficiency (EQE%) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterizations of the DSSCs. Results: The semiconductor films with c-GNRs that had GNRs with an a.r. equal to 4:1 (c-GNRs 4:1) had lower absorption and higher transmission as compared to those with GNRs a.r equal to 3:1 (c-GNRs 3:1). Only the c-GNRs 3:1, which retained a similar shape and an a.r. equal to 1.5 after sintering, produced an enhancement in the power conversion efficiency eta% (23%), current J(sc) (8%), and voltage V-oc (2.5%) when used in combination with the dye cocktail containing the organic dye L1. On the contrary, the presence of c-GNRs 4:1 negatively influenced the photovoltaic performances of the cells containing this dye cocktail The same occurred for both types of c-GNRs with the dye cocktail containing L0. Conclusion: The use of c-GNRs 3:1 could actually improve the efficiency of co-sensitized DSSCs. On the other hand, the transformed dimensions of the c-GNRs 4:1 negatively influenced the photovoltaic characteristics when we used the same concentration of nanoparticles, and a semiconductor paste in small grains (i.e., about 20 nm). We attributed this fact both to a reduced penetration of the dyes in the films and to an inferior plasmonic effect.",,,,"Zani, Lorenzo/D-8561-2016; Dagar, Janardan/X-2164-2019; Lai, Sarah/Q-5846-2018","Zani, Lorenzo/0000-0003-0621-2648; Lai, Sarah/0000-0003-1245-2349",,,,,,,,,,,,1573-4137,1875-6786,,,,,2019,15,3,,,,,309,318,,10.2174/1573413714666180719122657,,,,,,,,WOS:000459044000013,,,,,

The results show that the addition of suitable amounts of Cu and N content in TiO2 can alter its optical and electrical properties by extending absorption in the visible region and band gap reduction. XPS and XRD measurements suggest that some of the Ti sites are replaced by Cu atoms, while O sites are occupied by N atoms. An adequate addition of Cu/N in TiO2 could lead to smaller particle size, higher specific surface area, increased dye adsorption and retarded charge carrier recombination.

The organic donor--acceptor dye used for dye-sensitized solar cells, based on 2-(3-hydroxy-6-oxo-6H-xanthene-9-yl)benzoic acid (fluorescein) and its five derivatives, was investigated. The derivatives were formed by attaching different donor groups at para position. The excited state energies, electron absorption spectra, and oscillator strengths (f) were calculated using TD-DFT/B3LYP/6-311G basis set calculations on fully DFT-optimized geometries. The HOMO orbital, LUMO orbital, and energy gap values show that fluorescein attached with thiophene (FST) compound has a smaller energy gap compared to others and the fluorescein attached with an amine (FSA) have a larger energy gap than all compounds. The increasing order of the energy gap between HOMO and LUMO for the fluorescein and its derivatives is FST<FSE<FSM<FS<FSO<FSA. In terms of electron injection efficiency, it was found that the FST has higher electron injection efficiency compared with other derivatives. In addition, light-harvesting efficiencies (LHEs) were calculated and the results showed that the FST has the highest LHE value. It is therefore suggested that FST has better properties for application in DSSC according to the result obtained.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1110-662X,1687-529X,,,,,2019,,,,,,,,,4616198,10.1155/2019/4616198,,,,,,,,WOS:000456598400001,,,,,

Various approaches for size and shape-controlled synthesis of plasmonic NPs (typically Ag or Au NPs) have been discussed. Plasmonic NPs are found to be unstable in iodide based redox electrolytes commonly used in DSSCs and high temperature sintering during photoanode preparation. Therefore, plasmonic NPs are encapsulated with metal oxides, specifically TiO2 or SiO2 NPs, to form core-shell structures in order to improve their chemical and thermal stability. The synthesis process and optical characteristics of plasmonic core-shell NPs are discussed in detail. Incorporation of plasmonic core-shell NPs has improved the light harvesting capability of the photoanode and hence significantly improved the performance of DSSCs. Plasmonic core-shell NPs have also decreased the amount of active material required to attain high efficiency. The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of plasmonic NPs is tuned by varying their size, shape or shell thickness and composition for better overlapping with the absorption spectrum of the sensitizer in order to further improve the light harvesting capability. The factors responsible for the enhancement in the performance of plasmonic DSSCs, such as resonant energy transfer, hot electron injection, and local electromagnetic field enhancement, are discussed in detail.

The size of the macropores was varied by employing PS beads with different diameters (62, 130 and 250 nm). The influence of the macropore size on the dye loading and pore infiltration is the main purpose of this article. The bimodal porosity leads to increased light scattering due to enhanced optical path length, and better pore infiltration of the polysiloxane electrolyte is achieved. The amount of dye uptake by the dual films is lower than that of soft films because the large pore size reduces the total surface area. The optimum bimodal structure was obtained when combining P123 surfactant and the 130 nm PS beads leading to the lowest charge transfer resistance and a high efficiency for DSSCs is reported with both liquid and polymer electrolytes.

The presence of rhodanine moiety at the acceptor unit in D102, D149 and D205, shows an additional slow electron injection process, of picosecond time-scale, on the low band-gap semiconductor, TiO2. This slow process is expected to be present due to a twisted intramolecular charge transfer/isomerized state of the excited dye prior to electron injection. This isomerized state reduces as well the detrimental electron recombination process rates, and results of high performance in solar cells based on these rhodanine dyes. Replacing the rhodanine moiety by a cyano-acrylic group in D131 dye shows faster electron injection and recombination processes, due to the lower dipole moment present in the excited state, hindering the formation of an isomerized state.

The effects of fused thiophene units on the spectra and electrochemical properties of the anthracene dyes are computationally demonstrated. Our calculations show that with the sizes of the oligothienoacene units increasing from thienothiophene, dithienothiophene, to tetrathienoacene, the lowest-energy absorption peaks basically remain the same, however the oscillator strength gradually increases and the adsorption bands systematically broaden. When cyclopentadithiophene with a similar size to dithienothiophene is incorporated into the donor part, a remarkable 43 nm red-shift of the absorption peak and a broader absorption band are found, with a similar oscillator strength. The calculated ultra-fast injection time of electrons from the excited state of all anthracene dyes to the conduction band of TiO2 is ideal for DSSC applications.

Critical factors are the solvent, presence of ionic liquid, and the use of the additives 1-methylbenzimidazole (MBI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP). For the electrolyte solvent, 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN) is preferable to acetonitrile, leading to a higher short-circuit current density (J(SC)) with little change in the open-circuit voltage (V-OC). For electrolytes containing MPN, an ionic liquid and MBI (0.5 M), DSC performance depended on the ionic liquid with 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluoridophosphate (EMIMPF) > 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII) > 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII) approximate to 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluoridophosphate (BMIMPF). Omitting the MBI leads to a significant improvement in i sc when the ionic liquid is DMPII, BMII or BM1MPF, but with EM1MPF the removal of the MBI additive results in a dramatic decrease in V-OC (542 to 42 mV). For electrolytes containing MPN and DMPII, the effects of altering the MBI concentration have also been investigated. Although the addition of TBP improves V-OC, it causes significant decreases in J(SC). The best performing DSCs with the NHC-iron(II) dye employ an I-/I-3(-)-based electrolyte with MPN as solvent, DMPII ionic liquid (0.6 M) with no or 0.01 M MBI; values of J(SC) = 2.31 to 2.78 mA cm(-2), V-OC = 292 to 374 mV have been achieved giving eta in the range of 0.47 to 0.57% which represents 7.8 to 9.3% relative to an N719 reference DSC set at 100%.

These differently sintered layers were used as the compact hole blocking layers in dye-sensitized and perovskite solar cells systems, keeping all other processes of cells preparation below 150 degrees C (including mesoporous oxides layers), simulating thus the low-T processes. Some jumps of blocking layer parameters found within sintering are related to a step increase of the efficiency of dye-senzitized cells at 150 degrees C, that can be useful in the low-temperature process, e.g. if TiAcAc is used as a binder of nanoparticles. However, deeper structural changes of the layers leading to higher efficiency were found out just above 350 degrees C. It is caused primarily by too high series resistances of low-T blocking layers that are very amorphous. So the addition of more conductive (anatase) nanoparticles into the blocking layer is much demanded.

Moreover, the formation of amide bonds between dye molecules and g-C3N4 was firstly confirmed by FTIR spectrum and theoretical calculation.

In DSSCs, the triiodide reduction at the surface of TiO2 is one of the detrimental processes that limit the realization of high efficiencies of the device. To alleviate the active sites available on the semiconductor surface for this detrimental process, the interfacial modification of the dye-adsorbed TiO2 vertical bar electrolyte interface has been attempted by coadsorption of oleic acid (OA) over the TiO2 surface. Thus, the modified cell exhibited a higher efficiency (eta) of 12.9% under one sun illumination when compared with that of the unmodified cell (eta = 11.1%). To provide an insight into the OA anchoring and dynamics of electron transport at the photoanode vertical bar electrolyte interface, molecular spectroscopic and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic analyses were carried out. A red shift in the optical absorption spectrum was observed after the addition of OA to dye-adsorbed TiO2. The binding of OA to TiO2 surface was found to be through bridging bidentate type. Mott-Schottky analyses of the DSSCs under dark conditions were made to probe the shift in the Fermi level of TiO2 upon OA modification. In addition, the Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) has been found between OA and N719 dye.

We incorporated the pyridothiadiazole group, as a stronger electron-withdrawing group, into the commonly well-established skeleton of D-porphyrin-triple bond-acceptor sensitizers by a single atom change for a well-known strong electron-withdrawing benzothiadiazole (BTD) unit as an auxiliary acceptor. The impact of the pyridothiadiazole group on the optical; electrochemical; and photovoltaic properties of D-pi-A porphyrin sensitizers was investigated with comparison for a benzothiadiazole-substituted SGT-020 porphyrin. The pyridothiadiazole-substituted SGT-024 porphyrin dye was red-shifted so that the absorption range might be expected to achieve higher light harvest efficiency (LHE) than the SGT-020 porphyrin. However, all the devices were fabricated by utilizing SGT-020 and SGT-024, evaluated and found to achieve a cell efficiency of 10.3% for SGT-020-based DSSC but 4.2% for SGT-024-based DSSC under standard global AM 1.5G solar light conditions. The main reason is the lower charge collection efficiency of SGT-024-based DSSC than SGT-020-based DSSC, which can be attributed to the tilted dye adsorption mode on the TiO2 photoanode. This may allow for faster charge recombination, which eventually leads to lower J(sc), and V(oc )power conversion efficiency (PCE).",,,,,"Kim, Hwan Kyu/0000-0002-6189-5237",,,,,,,,,,,,2079-4991,,,,,DEC,2018,8,12,,,,,,,1030,10.3390/nano8121030,,,,,,,,WOS:000455323100068,30544904,,,,

The platinum CE, despite being the standard counter electrode in DSSCs, has drawbacks of platinum's rarity and high cost. Platinum is an excellent redox catalyst, and consequently, it is the most sought-after metal for catalytic conversions. The huge demand for platinum in the automotive industry for vehicular catalytic converters, the pharmaceutical industry, and in oil refining, as well as other industries, has driven its price to unprecedented levels. The prohibitive price of platinum has caused newer thin film technologies, such as the DSSC which depends on the platinum CE, to be cost-ineffective, thus meaning they cannot compete with the better-established silicon-based solar cells. These problems have stagnated the development of the DSSC, which in turn has dampened larger commercialisation prospects for this thin film technology. With this in mind, this review paper focuses on recent progress in the research and development of alternative cost-effective materials to replace Pt-based CEs. Ternary alloys are amongst the possible alternatives that have been explored, yielding varied results. Alloys, especially ternary sulphides, selenides, and oxides, are attractive as alternatives as they are cheap and are easily fabricated. Ternary alloys also have a synergistic effect produced by the coexistence of two metal ions in a crystal structure, which is believed to induce greater catalytic capability, thus making them ideal cost-effective materials to replace the Pt CE in DSSCs. This review intends to highlight the performance of ternary alloy counter electrodes through the analysis of charge transfer resistance and power conversion efficiencies. Focus is also given to the restrictions and impediments to the attainment of higher power conversion efficiency in alternative CEs. The advances in fabrication of simple ternary alloys, as well as more advanced hierarchical nanostructured counter electrodes, are discussed here in detail. Results obtained to date indicate that the efficiencies of ternary alloy counter electrodes are still below that of the platinum counter electrode, and hence more research is required to enhance their efficiencies.",,,,"Meyer, Edson L/C-8127-2018; Taziwa, Raymond/N-9389-2019","Meyer, Edson L/0000-0002-9912-311X; Taziwa, Raymond/0000-0002-5374-6223",,,,,,,,,,,,2075-4701,,,,,DEC,2018,8,12,,,,,,,1080,10.3390/met8121080,,,,,,,,WOS:000455072100104,,,,,
