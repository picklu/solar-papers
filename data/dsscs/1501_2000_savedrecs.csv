The most noticeable aspect of the newly synthesized NF-TiO2 is significant reduction in the bandgap energy which increased the ability to absorb light in the visible region. Using NF-TiO2 on the FTO as a photoanode of the DSSC (at best composition, NF-3.0 TiO2), achieves a total photoelectric conversion efficiency of 4.9%. Improvement in the performance of DSSC can be attributed to the effective absorption of sensitizer molecules in the presence of NF-TiO2, high light harvesting ability, reduction of grain boundaries and the bulk defects in TiO2, followed by the reduction of charge transfer resistance. By using NF-3.0 TiO2 on OR, 97.0% of methyl violet (MV) pollutant decomposes in the presence of sunlight in 280 min. To achieve an efficient system for the degradation of pollutant, bifunctionalized NF-TiO2 film is also used. In the new strategy, one part of the film is used as dye-sensitized zone (which acts as a DSSC(, and the other as a degradation zone. The results show a significant degradation of about 99.0% at 160 min. Ultimately, to improve the degradation zone molecularly imprinted polymers coated with Co-doped g-C3N4/TiO2 nanocomposite were used. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The technologies identified by the PV experts are well represented amongst the most frequently occurring (highest ranked) keywords retrieved by TIM. The more salient keywords tend to correspond to the relatively more established technologies such as dye sensitised solar cells, organic PV and more recently-developed technologies such as perovskites. These high rated/developed keywords/technologies can be relatively straightforwardly detected through bibliometric analysis.

The effect of MoO3 coated TiO2 on charge carrier transport was examined in resulting DSSCs and observed that similar to 14% enhancement in efficiency is possible for 5 min passivation of MoO3 on TiO2. The physical vapor deposited MoO3 films were similar to 75% transparent in the spectral range of 350-800 nm with an optical bandgap of similar to 3.1 eV. The wide bandgap MoO3 films facilitate the incoming photons to reach the sensitizing dye to generate excitons. The 14% enhancement in the performance of DSSC by MoO3 passivation is observed through improving only the FF and P-MAX while it does not contribute anything significantly to current density and open circuit voltage. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic studies further confirmed these observations through photoelectron lifetime, which remains constant both in the bulk of pristine TiO2 and MoO3 passivated TiO2 and it further confirms the effect of MoO3 passivation on FF and P-MAX in DSSCs.

The use of a narrow-bandgap semiconductor such as CdS NPs in the photoelectrochemical (PEC) detection of chemicals and biological molecules plays a key role as a photosensitizer and promotes some specific advantages in light-harvesting media. Their size-controlled optical and electrical properties make NPs fascinating and promising materials for a variety of nanoscale photovoltaic devices. Moreover, charge injection from the narrow bandgap to the adjacent material leads to efficient charge separation and prolongs the electron lifetime by the elimination of the charge carrier recombination probability. In this regard, a single photon enables the production of multiple photogenerated charge carriers in CdS NPs, which subsequently boosts the effectiveness of the photovoltaic devices.

Improved performance of photoanode with hybrid composite scaffold can be accredited to the boosted optical response in conjunction with impeded reverse tunneling probability of STO NCMS containing photoanode. Micron-sized STO NCMS provides a better light absorption in the photoanodes owing to optical confinement of incident light by multiple reflections generated from mirror-like facets of SrTiO3 nanocubes as well as enhanced light scattering effects from individual entity.

One of the merits in the studied structure motif D---A was modulating the molecular geometry of the sensitizers and eliminating the steric effect between the donor and -spacer (terthiophene) to furnish a coplanar molecular structure and to maximize electronic conjugation. In addition, coupling-steric effect precludes effective conjugation and reduces light harvesting as it increases the band gap. To eliminate the steric effect of the aryl moiety at ortho position of 2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl donor, another conjugated spacer, alkene (CH?CH), was inserted between the donor and the -spacer (terthiophene), which maximized the electron conjugation throughout the coplanar system; the optimized molecular geometry of the dyes was calculated using DFT. Another molecular geometry feature that was studied was the influence of different anchoring groups on coplanarity of the dye structure and consequently the photovoltaic performance. In the case of MR-3, where the anchoring group is based on the cyanoacrylic group, the optimized geometry was found coplanar. However, when rhodanine moiety was used as an anchoring group, the calculated optimized geometry of the dye (MR-4) was not coplanar, which resulted in weak electronic coupling and inferior electronic injection into TiO2 conduction band edge.

Unfortunately, the efficiency decreased expeditiously (from 8.76% to 7.88%) in three consecutive measurements. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests also reveal that the Ox1 and Red1 peaks of the CE disappear after a few cycles, which could be attributed to the fact that pure Fe3O4 was easily corroded in the electrolyte, and the catalytic activity was gradually lost after repeated tests. Here, a novel strategy is that Fe3O4 spheres are encapsulated within the 3D reduced graphene (3DRGO) networks to enhance the stability of CV. Three consecutive photovoltaic measurements demonstrate that PCE of the cell with Fe3O4@3DRGO nanocomposites as CE has been enhanced and the cell shows surprising stabilization (PCE = 9.10%, 9.07% and 9.05% in the three consecutive tests, respectively). The specific surface area of the composite is increased after introducing 3DRGO, which is helpful for electrons transferring rapidly from external circuit to the system of redox to catalytically reduce triiodide, and also decreases charge-transfer resistance. This work not only achieves the outstanding photovoltaic performance and stabilization, but also offers a promising strategy in constructing 3D nanomaterials with novel structure for wide energy applications.

Then a certain amount of TiO2Nb/STO CNFs was added into the TiO2 nanocrystalline layer to obtain the composite photoanode of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Owing to the high electrical conductivity and straightforward electron transport channels for TiO2-Nb/STO CNFs, the device assembled with 10 wt% TiO2-Nb/STO CNFs demonstrated the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.25%, which was significantly higher than the reference one (6.45%). In order to investigate the temperature gradient ( Delta T) on the photovoltaic performances of DSSCs assembled with TiO2-Nb/STO CNFs, a cold source (0 degrees C) and a heat source (75 degrees C) was placed on the Pt counter electrode to create a negative Delta T (-7 K) and a positive Delta T (+7 K), respectively. The mechanism model of thermoelectric effect on the charge transfer dynamic process of DSSCs under different Delta T is established and explained. Data showed that in response to temperature fluctuations, the performance of both reference device and 10% device could be affected. The cold source enable the reference device to obtain the highest PCE of 6.75% due to an increase in open-circuit voltage (V-oc). This behavior is mainly ascribed to the reduced internal carrier recombination rates, caused by decreased carrier concentrations at low operating temperature. Herein, the operating temperature refers to an average value between the temperatures on both sides of each device. On the contrary, 10% device applying hot source results in an increase of short-circuit current density (J(sc)) and fill factor (FF), yielding the highest PCE of 7.61% despite the negative effects of high operating temperature on V-oc. It is found that the hot source benefits the fast electron transfer for 10% device under the synergistic effect of thermoelectromotive force and fast charge carrier diffusion. These results further confirm that the improved photovoltaic performance of 10% device under the condition of hot source was primarily attributed to the thermoelectric Seebeck effect of TiO2-Nb/STO CNFs.

Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance measurements indicated that the carbon-CoFe nanocube electrode exhibited better catalytic performance than the nanotube, nanoparticle, and Pt electrodes, mostly due to its higher surface area and suitable pore size distribution for facilitating the iodide/triiodide couple.

Six thiophene or furan containing dye analogs were synthesized to analyze iodine binding to the dyes via Raman spectroscopy, UV-Vis studies, device performance metrics and density functional theory (DFT) based computations. Evidence suggests I-2 binds thiophene-based dyes stronger than furan-based dyes. This leads to higher DSC device currents and voltages from furan analogues, and longer electron lifetimes in DSC devices using furan based dyes. Raman spectrum of the TiO2 surface-bound dyes reveals additional and more instense peaks for thiophene dyes in the presence of I-2 relative to no I-2. Additionally, broader and shifted UV-Vis peaks are observed for thiophene dyes in the presence of I-2 on TiO2 films suggesting significant interaction between the dye molecules and I-2.

To tackle this issue, here we design a series of push-pull porphyrin dyes with anchoring groups either at meso- or beta-position using calculations based on first-principles time-dependent density functional theory. In contrast to the common perception, we find that porphyrin dyes bearing an electron-donor at the meso-position and an electron-acceptor at the beta-position produce an additional extended band between the Soret and Q-bands appearing at around 500 nm due to S-0 -> S-3 excitation, leading to a much higher light-harvesting performances compared to meso- and beta-disubstituted ones.

Herein, we focus on the investigation of carrier dynamics of a triphenylamine-based dye, LEG4, sensitized TiO2 (LEG4/TiO2) in contact with two types of electrolyte systems: pure cobalt-based electrolytes and in combination with an organic donor, tri(p-anisyl)amine (TPAA). Four different cobalt redox systems with potentials spanning a 0.3 V range were studied, and the carrier recombination and regeneration kinetics were monitored both at low and at high TiO2 (e(-)) densities (1.3 X 10(18) and 1.3 X 10(19) cm(-3), respectively). The results reveal that the introduction of the TPAA intermediate more effectively suppress the recombination loss of TiO2 (e(-)) under high charge conditions, close to open-circuit, as compared to low charge conditions. As a result, the charge transfer from the cobalt complexes to the oxidized dyes is significantly improved by the addition of TPAA. Dye-sensitized solar cells fabricated with the TPAA-containing electrolytes demonstrate remarkable improvement in both V-OC and J(SC) and lead to more than 25% increase of the light-to-electricity conversion efficiency. Furthermore, an unprecedented detrimental impact of TPAA on the device performance was identified when the redox potential of the TPAA donor and the cobalt complexes are close. This is ascribed to the formation of TPAA(center dot+) which can act as an active recombination centers and thus lower the solar cell performance.

Both desorption and oxidatively induced ligand substitution were observed on planar fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrodes, with a dependence on the E-1/2 Ru(III/II) redox potential dictating the comparative ratios of the processes. Complexes such as RuP4OMe (E-1/2 = 0.91 vs Ag/AgCl) displayed virtually only desorption, while complexes such as RuPbpz (E-1/(2) > 1.62 V vs Ag/AgCl) displayed only chemical decomposition. Comparing isomers of 4,4'- and 5,5'-disubstituted-2,2'-bipyridine ancillary ligands, a dramatic increase in the rate of desorption of the Ru(III) complexes was observed for the 5,5'-ligands. Nanoscopic indium-doped tin oxide thin films (nanolTO) were also sensitized and analyzed with cyclic voltammetry, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, and Xray photoelectron spectroscopy, allowing for further distinction of desorption versus ligand-substitution processes. Desorption loss to bulk solution associated with the planar surface of FTO is essentially non-existent on nanolTO, where both desorption and ligand substitution are shut down with RuP4OMe.

Water-splitting dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells (WS-DSPECs) provide a modular approach for integrating light-harvesting molecules with water-oxidation catalysts on metal-oxide electrodes. Despite recent progress in improving the efficiency of these devices by introducing good molecular water-oxidation catalysts, WS-DSPECs have poor stability, owing to the oxidation of molecular components at very positive electrode potentials. Here we demonstrate that a solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell (ss-DSSC) can be used as a buried junction for stable photoelectrochemical water splitting. A thin protecting layer of TiO2 grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) stabilizes the operation of the photoanode in aqueous solution, although as a solar cell there is a performance loss due to increased series resistance after the coating. With an electrodeposited iridium oxide layer, a photocurrent density of 1.43 mA cm(-2) was observed in 0.1 M pH 6.7 phosphate solution at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, with good stability over 1 h. We measured an incident photon-to-current efficiency of 22% at 540 nm and a Faradaic efficiency of 43% for oxygen evolution. While the potential profile of the catalyst layer suggested otherwise, we confirmed the formation of a buried junction in the as-prepared photoelectrode.

Here, we describe the design of a 3D architecture based on polystyrene spheres (PS) coated with ordered multilayers of urchin-like ZnO NWs (U-ZnO NWs) to be used as a high surface area nanostructure photoanode for dye-sensitized solar cells.

The ordered layers of U-ZnO NWs were then coated with a thin layer of TiO2 by atomic layer deposition, and topped with a similar to 9-14 mu m thick layer of anatase TiO2 NPs. We found that assembling organized layers of U-ZnO NWs significantly increased the surface area and provided better photon absorption.

However, the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) constructed using different pastes show similar photoelectric conversion performances despite the different mesoscopic structures and transmission properties of the TiO2 layers. The DSSCs based on the experimental TiO2 pastes show lower photoelectric conversion efficiencies compared with the DSSC constructed using a commercially available reference paste. These results suggest that the primary TiO2 particles have a greater influence on the photoelectric conversion performance of the DSSC than the secondary particles. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency spectra of the DSSCs based on the TiO2 pastes exhibit a slight dependence on wavelength. Thus, it is possible that minor light-scattering effects resulting from the mesoscopic structure of TiO2 occur in the DSSCs constructed using the pastes.

Sodium 1,4-bis(neopentyloxy)-3-(neopentyloxycarbonyl)-1,4-dioxobutane-2-sulphonate (TC14) surfactant was utilised as dispersing and stabilising agent in electrochemical exfoliation to synthesise graphene oxide (GO) as initial solution for rGO production prior to its further hybridisation and fabrication as thin film. A chemical reduction process utilising hydrazine hydrate was conducted to produce rGO due to the low temperature process and water-based GO solution. Subsequently, hybrid solution was prepared by mixing 1 wt% MWCNTs into the produced rGO solution. TC14-rGO and TC14-rGO_MWCNTs hybrid solution were transferred into fluorine-doped tin oxide substrate to fabricate thin film by spraying deposition method. Finally, the CE films were prepared by coating with thin Pt NPs. Photoanode film was prepared by a two-step process: hydrothermal growth method to synthesise titanium dioxide nanowires (TiO2 NWs) and subsequent squeegee method to apply TiO2 NPs. According to solar simulator measurement, the highest energy conversion efficiency (eta) was achieved by using CE-based TC14-rGO_MWCNTs/Pt (1.553%), with the highest short current density of 4.424 mA/cm(2). The highest eta was due to the high conductivity of CE hybrid film and the morphology of fabricated TiO2 NWs/TiO2 NPs. Consequently, the dye adsorption was high, and the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs was increased. This result also showed that rGO and rGO_MWCNTs hybrid can be used as considerable potential candidate materials to replace Pt gradually.",,,,"Ahmad, Mohd Khairul/I-3378-2018; Mamat, M.H./X-7876-2018; Mamat, M.H./P-9026-2015; Mohamed, Azmi/A-2345-2013","Ahmad, Mohd Khairul/0000-0001-8336-3154; Mamat, M.H./0000-0002-6640-2366; Mamat, M.H./0000-0002-6640-2366; Mohamed, Azmi/0000-0001-7310-6680",,,,,,,,,,,,0957-4522,1573-482X,,,,JUL,2018,29,13,,,,,10723,10743,,10.1007/s10854-018-9139-4,,,,,,,,WOS:000435588600005,,,,,

The presence of a traces of Cu in the aluminum leads to the formation of 3D nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) structure which consisted of an array of cylindrical pores interconnected by horizontal holes. Under different anodizing conditions, four different AAO substrates were fabricated and applied for developing DSSCs. The current-voltage characteristics of the DSSCs were measured and compared. Results obtained indicated that the performance (photocurrent density, open-circuit photovoltage and efficiency) of DSSCs based on 3D AAO was significantly enhanced compared to those of FTO/TiO2. The efficiencies of DSSCs based on alumina P90A, P90B and OX60 were improved by 172%, 51%, and 274%, respectively. The enhancement in photocurrent and efficiency is attributed to the reduction in the carrier recombination, uniform distribution of the dye molecules inside the vertical tubes, horizontal interconnections of pores as well as a reduction in pore size. This indicates that AAO based DSSCs can contribute significantly to energy harvesting from the sun. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

To enhance adsorption capacity of BChl a on the electrode, in this study, the TiCl4 and acetic acid treatment were used to modify the TiO2 film (named as T-TiO2 film and A-TiO2 film, respectively). The optimal adsorption parameters were examined by adsorption kinetic and adsorption isotherms of BChl a on the different types of TiO2 films. The effects of TiO2 film thickness and pigment concentrations on adsorption capacity and photoelectric properties of BChl a were systematically investigated.

Certain reservations about the conventionally employed temperature accelerated lifetime measurements test for its unworthiness of predicting reliable lifetimes of polymer solar cells are brought into light. Critical issues concerning the accelerated lifetime testing include, assuming reaction mechanism instead of determining it, and relying solely on the temperature acceleration of a single property of material. An advanced approach comprising a set of theoretical models to estimate the accurate lifetimes of polymer solar cells is therefore suggested in order to suitably alternate the accelerated lifetime testing. This approach takes into account systematic kinetic modeling of various possible polymer degradation mechanisms under natural weathering conditions. The proposed kinetic approach is substantiated by its applications on experimental aging data-sets of polymer solar materials/solar cells including, P3HT polymer film, bulk heterojunction (MDMO-PPV:PCBM) and dye-sensitized solar cells.

The Raman spectra confirm that the complexes were effectively anchored to the ZnO NWs through one of the pendant nitrile groups of the bipyridyl ligands. The nanostructured morphology of the NW electrodes was maintained so that their light trapping characteristics were preserved. The Ru complexes were found to be excellent sensitizers of the ZnO NWs, improving by orders of magnitude their photocurrent in the visible region.

An order of magnitude shortening of the persistent photocurrent relaxation times (after the illumination is interrupted) was found to occur upon successful sensitization of the ZnO NWs with the Ru complexes. This effect is interpreted in terms of hole traps at similar to 1 eV above the ZnO valence band edge, which are lowered by similar to 50-60 meV in the soaked samples due to screening of the trap centers provided by the extra photoexcited charge carriers transferred from the sensitizing complex to the NWs.",,,,,"Vega, Nadia Celeste/0000-0003-2197-3816",,,,,,,,,,,,2053-1591,,,,,JUL,2018,5,7,,,,,,,75020,10.1088/2053-1591/aacfa5,,,,,,,,WOS:000438507800006,,,,,

The calculated results indicate that, DCE2 has larger harvesting efficiency (LHE), electron accepting power (omega(+)) and dipole moment (u(normal)) as well as lower reorganization energy (lambda(total)) and chemical hardness (eta), which lead to a higher short circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) compared to DCE1.

Physical chemistry aspect of the robust star-shaped sensitizer has been investigated, employing the Current over Voltage analysis (I-V) and Transient Absorption Spectroscopy (TAS) methods. The computational studies based on density functional theory (DFT) and quantum calculations were clearly indicated that the rate of the Interfacial electron transfer (IET) significantly depends on the binding mode of a sensitizer to semiconductor surface and the nature of the electronic population in lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) that initially localized on the adsorbate molecule, which is in a good agreement with experimental results. Our main result is that, among different possible binding modes of anchoring group to TiO2 surface, the bridging mode has the shortest life time of 28 fs in the presence of visible light as the excitation source. To investigate negative effect of the sensitizer molecules aggregation on TiO2 surface, on the performance of the cell, was examined the dye loading time on TiO2 surface for 10, 16 and 20 hours, which 16 hours of dye loading on surface exhibited the best DSSC performance.

The purpose was to study the effect of MLCT direction on the rates of hole injection into NiO and subsequent charge recombination. Surprisingly, femtosecond-transient absorption spectroscopy showed that the two heteroleptic, cyclometalated complexes of this series did not inject holes into NiO, but their excited states were nevertheless quenched in a rapid process (on the time scale of hundreds of picoseconds). An identical result was obtained for the dyes on nonreactive ZrO2 and we therefore attribute the short MLCT lifetime to self-quenching, due the high surface concentrations of the dyes. We further show that self quenching on this time scale can potentially compete with hole injection also for functional NiO sensitizers. A ruthenium polypyridine complex, which has previously been used for NiO-based solar cells, was shown to inject holes only very slowly (tau approximate to 5 ns), in contrast to the common notion that hole injection in dye-NiO systems is ultrafast (predominantly subpicosecond time scale).

Using cyclic voltammetry, the electrochemical properties and characteristic spin crossover inherent in this class of metal complexes were analyzed. From the electrochemical analysis the standard heterogeneous rate constant (k(s,h)) was estimated. These constants were 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than other outer-sphere redox couples, such as Co(bpy)(3)(2+/3+) with k(s,h) values decreasing from 6.39 (+/- 0.7) x 10(-3) cm/s in Co(bpy)(3) to 1.60 (+/- 0.3) X 10(-5) cm/s in bis[hydrotris(4-ethylpyrazolyl)]borate manganese(II/III). It was theorized that the drastic reduction in the rate of electron transfer could be used to increase the lifetimes of the injected electrons in quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs). Indeed, this was found to be the case with the slope of open-circuit voltage decay measurements being an order of magnitude lower in the Mn-based redox couples, compared to Co(bpy)(3) when using cells prepared under the same conditions. This increase led us to then focus on optimizing the electrolyte solvent to assess the current-voltage characteristics of cells prepared using the MnTp(2) family of redox mediators. These cells displayed enhanced power conversion efficiencies when compared to Co(bpy)(3) despite poor diffusion throughout the nanostructured TiO2 film. Analysis of the quenching rate constant via Stern-Volmer quenching analysis suggested that the MnTp(2) family of redox mediators possesses an adequate ability to regenerate the quantum dot sensitizer, with values of kg being on similar orders of magnitude as other Co- and Cu-based redox couples employed in dye-sensitized solar cells.

The pronounced charge transfer character of the directly photoexcited state is in principle favorable for a charge injection. Here, we report a time-resolved fluorescence study of a triphenylamine- bithiophene-naphthalimide dye in four solvents of varying polarity using fluorescence upconversion. The recording of femtosecond time-resolved fluorescence spectra corrected for the group velocity dispersion allows for a detailed analysis discriminating between spectral shifts and total intensity decays. After photoexcitation, the directly populated state (S-1/FC) evolves toward a relaxed charge transfer state (S-1/CT). This S-1/CT state is characterized by a lower radiative transition moment and a higher nonradiative quenching. The fast dynamic shift of the fluorescence band is well described by solvation dynamics in polar solvents, but less so in nonpolar solvents, hinting that the excited-state relaxation process occurs on a free energy surface whose topology is strongly governed by the solvent polarity.

Herein, Au@Ag core shell nano particles (NPs) were employed for the fabrication of AupAg/N-3/n-TiO2 systems. With the help of the CT degree (rho(cT)), surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectra are utilized to evaluate the CT processes upon layer-by-layer addition of TiO2 to metal/N3/n-TiO2 systems based on AupAg, Ag, and Au. The layer-dependent SERS intensity and rho(cT) for Au@Ag/N3/n-TiO2 revealed a CT enhancement involving TiO2 at excitation wavelengths of 488, 514.5, 647, and 785 nm, whereas Ag/N3/n-TiO2 presented such enhancement only at excitation wavelengths of 488 and 514.5 nm. The mechanisms of CT process are proposed to explain such reduced CT energy threshold: In AupAg/N3/n-TiO2, an equivalent CT process involving TiO2 is first proposed, in which the electrons are directly transferred from the HOMO level of N3 to the much lower CB3 level of the Au@Ag/TiO2 complex due to energy level equilibration, which reduces the CT threshold involving TiO2 below1.58 eV, extends the CT response region involving TiO2 from 488 to 514.5 nm (Ag/N3/n-TiO2) to 488-785 nm and enhances the CT efficiency in the high-energy region. Finally, AupAg1-5 with different Ag/Au ratios were prepared for the fabrication of bimetal/N3/n-TiO2 systems. In the AupAgl/N3/n-TiO2 and Au@Ag2/N3/n-TiO2 systems, the decreased CT threshold is induced by energy level equilibration; in the Au@Ag4/N3/n-TiO2 system, it is due to the dual effects of energy level equilibration and activation of Ag at the core shell surface induced by the inner Au.",,,,"ZHAO, Bing/P-2447-2014; Han, Xiao Xia/G-6607-2013; Kitahama, Yasutaka/N-9448-2016; Li, Peng/N-2884-2018","Han, Xiao Xia/0000-0002-0544-4351; Kitahama, Yasutaka/0000-0002-6447-2774; Li, Peng/0000-0002-3434-6339",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-7447,,,,,21-Jun,2018,122,24,,,,,12748,12760,,10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b02197,,,,,,,,WOS:000436381600020,,,,,

These thin films require a large surface area, to adsorb many dye molecules, and mesoporous channels so the electrolyte can permeate the film and regenerate the dye molecules. This favourable morphology is traditionally achieved by the random assembly of a network of nanoparticles by the sintering process. Two-photon polymerization is a 3D printing technique used to fabricate structures with feature resolutions down to 100 nm. We use this technique to fabricate TiO2 thin films of optimised 3D micro-design for use in DSSCs. Our films have a considerable advantage over the conventional (random assembly) films as it allows the implementation of light scattering designs which are shown to significantly enhance photocurrent in the cell by up to 25%.",,,,"Wu, Yupeng/T-2620-2018","Wu, Yupeng/0000-0001-8693-7459",,,,,,,,,,,,0927-0248,1879-3398,,,,15-Jun,2018,180,,,,,,103,109,,10.1016/j.solmat.2018.02.028,,,,,,,,WOS:000430765600012,,,,,

However, significant limiting factors include the fast electron recombination and slow mass transport of the oxidised redox mediator ([Co(bipy)(3)](3+)). In this work, the effect of non-uniform photogeneration on the mass transport of [Co(bipy)(3)](3+) through an electrolyte-infiltrated mesoporous TiO2 film was investigated. Different illumination conditions were used to control the photogeneration profile and the subsequent spatial distribution of [Co(bipy)(3)](3+) throughout the TiO2 film. They included parameters such as the light intensity, substrate-electrode/electrolyte-electrode (SE/EE) illumination direction, wavelength, and TiO2 photoanode thickness. Using large and small optical perturbation photocurrent transients, electron recombination kinetics with [Co(bipy)(3)](3+) were analysed in the time domain. Importantly, strong SE-absorption was shown to significantly contribute to the gradual depletion of [Co(bipy)(3)](3+) at the counter electrode, along with an increased film thickness and light intensity, resulting in excess recombination with [Co(bipy)(3)](3+) on the 10(-2)-1 s timescale. Furthermore, charge extraction current decay transients showed that a substantial amount of [Co(bipy)(3)](3+) can accumulate inside the TiO2 film, resulting in significant recombination at the collecting fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) contact on the 10(-3)-10(-2) s timescale. The sub-linear scaling of recombination with light intensity leads to deviating trends in charge extraction and electron transport measurements. Mass transport limitations and recombination losses at the FTO can be significantly reduced by maximising light absorption from the EE-side, which can increase PCE and reduce J-V hysteresis.",,,,"Boschloo, Gerrit/K-2082-2019","Boschloo, Gerrit/0000-0002-8249-1469",,,,,,,,,,,,2050-7488,2050-7496,,,,14-Jun,2018,6,22,,,,,10264,10276,,10.1039/c8ta02083c,,,,,,,,WOS:000437106300013,,,,,

Three states were analysed: open-circuit (OC), short circuit (SC), and under maximum power point (MPP)/load. OC and SC are more or less atypical states, which are relevant while storing cells or in the event of malfunction, whereas the MPP/load corresponds to real life operation of the cells. Our results indicate that keeping the cells at OC or near the MPP lead to practically identical stability, whilst the cells at SC degraded much faster in a 1000 h light soaking test. The underlying cause for the degradation of all the cells was the loss of tri-iodide (i.e. limiting charge carriers) in the electrolyte. While the degradation mechanism appears to be the same, the loss rate of tri-iodide was about five times faster with SC than with OC and MPP cells. In the SC cells, the loss of tri-iodide decreased both the short-circuit current and fill factor resulting in a 36% efficiency loss by the end of the test. In contrast, the efficiency of the OC and load cells remained quite stable throughout the test. Since OC is the most commonly used state in aging tests, it is good news for ageing studies that the real life MPP state and the OC state yield roughly similar results. The identification of the degradation pathway, the loss of charge carriers, and the related degradation rate were used to estimate the remaining lifetime of cells which did not degrade during the 1000 h test. Based on the degradation rate related to the charge carrier loss, full degradation of the OC and MPP cells is expected in approximately 3000 h of operational time. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The technological improvements have provided enormous solutions to the mankind for utilizing the solar energy although photovoltaic's (PV) by consuming sunlight. Photovoltaic is popularly known by the process of converting light to electricity. The current estimated growth by producing global power around 368 GW in 2017 and projecting 3000 to 10000 GW by 2030. Looking at all the available solar cells, it has been observed that the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) when compared to mono-Si or poly-Si has been effective in its performance and also reduces production cost to a great extent. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of DSSC has reached to a better extent and been discussed in the paper. There are other mechanisms through which the efficiency can be improved like applying the antireflection coating. Reflection is a usual phenomenon that happens when light incident from one medium to another varies in refractive index. This reflection is one of the important reasons for the loss of power in the PV Cell. So to improve the PCE, the Mono-Si or DSSC PV Cells can be applied with a thin film antireflection coating by the nanocomposite film consisting of single- or multi-wall carbon nanotubes with TiO2 and other efficient nanoparticles. This paper discusses on different kinds of nanocomposite materials, and their functionalities has been clearly given.

A 26% enhancement in the short circuit current density (J(SC)) achieved by incorporating 0.1 weight % of MoS2 nanoflakes in the bulk of TiO2 confirmed efficient electron transport achieved by suppressing the probability of electron-hole capture by TiO2 surface states due to the additional electron transport pathways established by MoS2 which facilitated the photo-generated electrons to reach the transparent electrode by skipping the TiO2 surface states. Results suggest that further increase in the quantity of MoS2 in TiO2 impedes the electron transport in the bulk as observed with 7% and 38% reduction in eta for 0.2 and 0.3 weight % of MoS2 in TiO2.

The Cu2CoSnS4 (CCTS) and Cu2NiSnS4 (CNTS) CEs exhibit smaller charge-transfer resistance and reasonable power conversion efficiency (PCE) (CCTS, 8.3%; CNTS, 8.2%), comparable to that of Pt (8.3%). In contrast, the CZTS-based DSSCs only generate a PCE of 7.9%. Density functional theory calculation indicate that the enhanced catalytic performance is associated to the adsorption and desorption energy of iodine atom on the Co2+ and Ni2+. In addition, the stability of CCTS and CNTS CEs toward electrolyte is also significantly improved as evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy characterizations.

In this work, Stark effect (electroabsorption) spectroscopy has been used to measure the polarizability and dipole moment changes in electronic transitions of pyrene-1-carboxylic (PCA),-acetic (PM) and-butyric (PBA) acids in ethanol, both free and adsorbed on colloidal TiO2, in glassy ethanol at low temperature. The lack of appreciable increase of dipole moment in the excited state of free and adsorbed PM and PBA points that two or more single bonds completely prevent the expansion of pi-electrons from the aromatic ring towards the carboxylic group, thus excluding the possibility of direct electron injection into TiO2. In free PCA, the pyrene's forbidden S-0 -> S-1 transition has increased intensity, exhibits a long progression in 1400 cm(-1) A(g) mode and is associated with vertical bar Delta mu vertical bar of 2 D. Adsorption of PCA on TiO2 causes a broadening and red shift of the S-0 -> S-1 absorption band and an increase in dipole moment change on electronic excitation to vertical bar Delta mu vertical bar = 6.5 D. This value increased further to about 15 D when the content of acetic acid in the colloid was changed from 0.2% to 2%, and this effect is ascribed to the surface electric field. The large increase of vertical bar Delta mu vertical bar points that the electric field effect can not only change the energetics of electron transfer from the excited sensitizer into the solid, but can also shift the molecular electronic density, thus directly influencing the electronic coupling factor relevant for electron transfer at the molecule-solid interface.

While various analytical chemistry methods have probed this fabrication process indirectly, the molecular structure of this interface has not been tracked with varying dye sensitization conditions, via any direct means.

Further XRR studies on N3-adsorbed TiO2 surfaces sensitized using different solvents, MeCN:t-BuOH (1:1, v/v), EtOH:t-BuOH (1:1, v/v), EtOH, and DMSO, showed that the nature of dye center dot center dot center dot TiO2 adsorption binding modes depends not only on the acidity of the N3-containing solutions, which dictate the dye deprotonation levels, but also on the steric nature of the sensitizing solvent.",,,,"Cole, Jacqueline/C-5991-2008; Holt, Stephen A/E-4662-2011","Holt, Stephen A/0000-0003-3189-8047",,,,,,,,,,,,2574-0962,,,,,JUN,2018,1,6,,,,,2821,2831,,10.1021/acsaem.8b00464,,,,,,,,WOS:000458705800055,,,,,

The uneven microstructure morphology of FTO (fluorine-doped tin oxide) glass surface and high porosity of TiO2 layer produce tiny gaps and voids at the FTO/TiO2 interface that breaks the connectivity, leading to an increase in the recombination process. In the current work, a dual functional passivating layer is introduced by the combination of the graphene/TiO2 compact layer. The excellent mobility and flexibility of graphene is capitalized using its layer to fill the voids in the FTO surface, which can consequently reduce the charge transfer resistance at the interface, while the added TiO2 compact layer avoids direct contact with the electrolyte thus reducing the recombination. Graphene was synthesized by the facile solvent exfoliation method with the assistance of the probe sonication process. The parameters of sonication were optimized to achieve high-quality concentrated graphene inks (0.177-0.51 mg/ml). Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the graphene obtained is of a few-layer type. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis indicated that the incorporated compact layer of graphene/TiO2 was capable of accelerating the charge transfer and reducing the recombination process at the FTO/TiO2 interface. Consequently, the photoconversion efficiency (PCE) for the device (1 cm(2) active area) with double-coated graphene layer under one sun irradiation (AM 1.5) was found to be 49.49% higher than the conventional one.",,,,"Shahid, Muhammad Umair/S-2471-2019; Muhsan, Ali/B-5392-2014","Muhsan, Ali/0000-0001-8270-0091",,,,,,,,,,,,2190-5509,2190-5517,,,,JUN,2018,8,5,,,,,1001,1013,,10.1007/s13204-018-0685-0,,,,,,,,WOS:000442669600009,,,,,

The possibility of reducing basic requirements in the field of electrochemical biosensing may open doors in this direction. This work proposes for this purpose an innovative electrochemical immunosensing system using a photovoltaic cell as an electrical reading box. Immunosensing ensures accuracy, the electrochemical-ground of the device ensures sensitivity and detectability, and the photovoltaic cell drives the system towards electrical autonomy. As proof-of-concept, Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was used herein, a cancer biomarker of clinical relevance. In brief, a conductive glass with a fluorine doped tin oxide film was used as conductive support and modified with anti-CEA by means of a bottom-up approach. All stages involved in the biochemical modification of the FTO surface were followed by electrochemical techniques, namely electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. This electrode acted as counter electrode of a dye-sensitized solar cells, and the electrical output of this cell was monitored for the different concentrations of CEA. Under optimized conditions, the device displayed a linear behaviour against CEA concentration, from 5 pg/mL to 15 ng/mL. The immunosensor was applied to the analysis of CEA in urine from healthy individual and spiked with the antigen.

The concentration effects of the GOS NFs on the conductivity of the electrolyte, and the performance of the DSSCs are studied. The results indicate that the inclusion of GOS NFs markedly enhances the conductivity of the liquid electrolyte. The electrochemical impendence spectroscopy (EIS) analysis shows that the presence of GOS NFs may increase the recombination resistance (R-ct) at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface and, furthermore, decreases the charge transfer resistance at the Pt counter electrode/electrolyte interface (R-pt). Therefore, the current density (J(sc)), open circuit potential (V-oc), and fill factor (FF) of the DSSCs can be improved by controlling the concentration of GOS NFs. In this study, the DSSC with 0.50 wt% GOS NFs can achieve the highest energy conversion efficiency of 9.44%, which is higher than that obtained for the corresponding cell without GOS NFs (8.84%).

The effect of different weather conditions on the cell performance is quantitatively investigated by using correlations coefficients of weather parameters to cell performance. No degradation was observed during the frosty period, but instead during the warmer, rainy periods with high moisture levels. Nevertheless, after 6 weeks of outdoor testing in varying harsh conditions, the cells maintained on average 88% of their initial efficiency. Tracking the cell performance during the aging showed that the test cells generated roughly as much current at subzero temperatures as at warmer temperatures. Investigations of the degradation reactions revealed that while photoelectrode degradation was the main cause of degradation during this test, the loss of charge carriers, which had only a minor effect on performance during the test, would likely become a major degradation factor during the next 1000 h of testing. Furthermore, the test showed that the cells even doubled their efficiency in low light intensity conditions compared with the standard reporting conditions.

There is also the contribution of back recombination kinetics from the photoexcited electrons via the dopant states in the AZO and TiZO layers, which are different among the layers due to the difference in dopant states distributions below their conduction bands.",,,,,"Hidayat, Rahmat/0000-0002-3081-4051",,,,,,,,,,,,0218-8635,1793-6624,,,,JUN,2018,27,2,,,,,,,1850019,10.1142/S0218863518500194,,,,,,,,WOS:000441333800007,,,,,

Therefore, we propose a new type of artificial skin for humanoid robots with hybrid functions, which we have termed hybrid skin (H-Skin). To realize the fabrication of such a solar cell, we have continued to utilize the principles of ordinary solid-state wet-type or dye-sensitized solar rubber as a follow-up study to the first report. In the first report, we dealt with both photovoltaic- and piezo-effects for dry-type magnetic compound fluid (MCF) rubber solar cells, which were generated because the polyisoprene, oleic acid of the magnetic fluid (MF), and water served as p- and n- semiconductors. In the present report, we deal with wet-type MCF rubber solar cells by using sensitized dyes and electrolytes. Photoreactions generated through the synthesis of these components were investigated by an experiment using irradiation with visible and ultraviolet light. In addition, magnetic clusters were formed by the aggregation of Fe3O4 in the MF and the metal particles created the hetero-junction structure of the semiconductors. In the MCF rubber solar cell, both photo- and piezo-electricity were generated using a physical model. The effects of tension and compression on their electrical properties were evaluated.

In the CVD reaction, N-GHBs were deposited directly on carbon cloth (CC) to be used as an efficient metal-free electrocatalyst for dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) applications. The highly curved N-GHBs could avoid the self-assembly restacking of planar graphene sheets, which usually occurred during the film preparation. Keeping oxygen contaminations from N-GHBs, the characteristic electrical conductivity of graphene was preserved in the as-synthesized N-GHBs. By controlling the evaporation temperature of melamine, the nitrogen-doping content of 8.7-14.0% and different nitrogen-doped configurations in N-GHBs could be adjusted. The catalytic activities of different nitrogen-doped states in N-GHBs toward the triiodide (I-3(-)) reduction in DSSCs were investigated, revealing that the pyridinic and quaternary nitrogens, rather than the total nitrogen doping level, in N-GHBs are mainly responsible for their catalytic activities in DSSCs. For solar cell applications, the high surface area and heteroatomic nitrogens of GHBs can remarkably improve the catalytic activity toward the triiodide reduction, lower the charge-transfer resistance, and enhance the corresponding photovoltaic performance (7.53%), which is comparable to that (7.70%) of a standard sputtered Pt counter electrode-based cell.

The anchoring and ancillary ligands chosen are ((6,6-dimethyl-[2,2-bipyridine]-4,4-diyl)-bis(4,1-phenylene))bis(phosphonic acid) (3) and 4,4-bis(4-iodophenyl)-6,6-diphenyl-2,2-bipyridine (4), respectively. In the first SALSAC procedure, the FTO/TiO2 electrode is functionalized with 3 in the first dye bath, and then undergoes ligand exchange with the homoleptic complex [Cu(4)(2)][PF6] to give surface-bound [Cu(3)(4)](+). In the second method, the FTO/TiO2 electrode functionalized with 3 is immersed in a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of [Cu(MeCN)(4)][PF6] and 4 to give surface-anchored [Cu(3)(4)](+). In the third procedure, the anchor 3, copper(I) ion and ancillary ligand 4 are introduced in a sequential manner. The performances of the DSSCs show a dependence on the dye assembly procedure. The sequential method leads to the best-performing DSSCs with the highest values of J(SC) (7.85 and 7.73 mA cm(-2) for fully masked cells) and overall efficiencies ( = 2.81 and 2.71%, representing 41.1 and 39.6% relative to an N719 reference DSSC).

The ligand exchange procedure leads to DSSCs that perform relatively poorly. The investigation demonstrates the versatile and powerful nature of SALSAC in preparing dyes for copper-based DSSCs, allowing the photoconversion efficiency of dye to be optimized for a given dye. The SALSAC strategy provides alternative hierarchical strategies where the isolation of the homoleptic [Cu(L-ancillary)(2)](+) is difficult or time-consuming; stepwise strategies are more atom-economic than ligand exchange involving the homoleptic [Cu(L-ancillary)(2)](+).",,,,"Hug, Frederik/L-5848-2019; Constable, Edwin/G-5648-2012","Housecroft, Catherine/0000-0002-8074-0089; Constable, Edwin/0000-0003-4916-4041",,,,,,,,,,,,2304-6740,,,,,JUN,2018,6,2,,,,,,,57,10.3390/inorganics6020057,,,,,,,,WOS:000436555000022,,,,,

Therefore, for DSSCs based on ZnO NRs/NSs with liquid electrolyte, the short-circuit current density (J(sc)), open-circuit voltage (V-oc), fill factor (FF), and photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) are 11.82 mAcm(-2), 0.66 V, 0.58, and 4.59%, respectively. The PCE of the DSSCs is improved by 178.18% compared to that of pure ZnO NRs cells (1.65%) and is improved by 21.42% with respect to pure ZnO NSs cells (3.78%).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2194-4288,2194-4296,,,,JUN,2018,6,6,,,,,1161,1167,,10.1002/ente.201700687,,,,,,,,WOS:000435271700018,,,,,

Understanding the factors controlling the surface orientation of sensitizing organic molecules will aid in the improvement of both traditional DSSCs and other devices that integrate molecular linkers at interfaces. Here, we describe a general approach to understand relative dye-substrate orientation and provide analytical expressions predicting orientation. We consider the effects of substrate, solvent, and protonation state on dye molecule orientation. In the absence of solvent, our model predicts that most carboxylic acid-functionalized molecules prefer to fie flat (parallel) on the surface, due to van der Waals interactions, as opposed to a tilted orientation with respect to the surface that is favored by covalent bonding of the carboxylic acid group to the substrate. When solvation effects are considered, however, the molecules are predicted to orient perpendicular to the surface. We extend this approach to help understand and guide the orientation of metal-organic framework (MOF) thin-film growth on various metal-oxide substrates. A two-part analytical model is developed on the basis of the results of DFT calculations and ab initio MD simulations that predicts the binding energy of a molecule by chemical and dispersion forces on rutile and anatase TiO2, surfaces, and quantifies the dye solvation energy for two solvents. The model is in good agreement with the DFT calculations and enables rapid prediction of dye molecule and MOF linker binding preference on the basis of the size of the adsorbing molecule, identity of the surface, and the solvent environment. We establish the threshold molecular size, governing dye molecule orientation, for each condition.",,,,,"Domenico, Janna/0000-0002-5825-2994",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-7447,,,,,24-May,2018,122,20,,,,,10846,10856,,10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b01526,,,,,,,,WOS:000433403400021,,,,,

By altering the connection sequence of the two subunits in the assembly, in their surface-binding to either TiO2 or NiO, the assembly can be tuned to convert visible light into strongly oxidizing equivalents for activation of an electrodeposited water oxidation catalyst (NiCo2Ox) at the photoanode, or reducing equivalents for activation of an electrodeposited water reduction catalyst (Nio(0.05)S(x)) at the photocathode.

The amino groups present in BSA act as nitrogen donors and surface stabilizing agents to generate a highly conductive and functionalized carbon heterostructure. The doped nitrogen was present in the form of pyridinic and pyrrolic states, as evidenced by XPS analysis.

Computational studies on modeled Zn-coordinated chlorins allowed identification of charge transfer and d-d transitions of the Ni2+ coordinated chlorins. Two fictive Zn chlorins, M1 and M2, were designed with thiophene units based on the fluorene substituted chlorin. Substitution with thiophene altered the typical arrangement of the four Gouterman molecular orbitals (MOs) and red-shifted and greatly intensified the lowest energy absorption band (the Q band). The introduction of the thiophene-based MO as the LUMO below the usual Gouterman LUMO is predicted to increase the efficiency of electron transfer from the dye to the conduction band of the semiconductor in DSSCs. The addition of a donor group on the opposite pyrrole (M2) red-shifted the Q band further and introduced a donor-based MO between the typical Gouterman HOMO and HOMO-1. Despite the relatively small Delta HOMO, M1 and M2 exhibited remarkably intense Q bands. M2 would be a possible candidate for application in DSSCs due to its panchromatic absorption, intense and red-shifted Q band, and the presence of the substituent based MO properties. Another indicator of a successful dye is the alignment of the ground state and excited state oxidation potentials (GSOP and ESOP, respectively) with respect to the conduction band of the semiconductor. The GSOP for M2 lies 0.55 eV below the I-/I3- redox potential and the ESOP lies 0.48 eV above the TiO2 conduction band. The impact of the thiophene dominance in the LUMO also supports the prediction of efficient sensitization properties. The remarkably intense Q band of M2 predicted to be at 777 nm with a Delta HOMO of just 1.04 eV provides a synthetic route to tetrapyrroles with extremely intense, red Q bands without the need for aza nitrogens of the phthalocyanines.

The choice of metal ion can have a large impact on the stability, loading concentration, and other properties of the films. Here we report our investigation into the role of the linking ion on the subnanosecond excited state dynamics in the bilayer films (TiO2-B-M-RuP). While metal linkers like Cd-II, La-III, Sn-IV, Zn-II, and Zr-IV are photochemically inert, paramagnetic linking ions such as C-II, Fe-II, and Mn-II quench the excited state of the dye with a rate constant on the order of 10(8) s(-1). The absence of new spectral features in the transient absorption spectrum suggests that energy transfer, and not electron transfer, is responsible for the excited state quenching. On TiO2, the electron injection rate for TiO2-B-M-RuP is an order of magnitude slower (similar to 1 X 10(9) s(-1)) than for the dye directly on TiO2 (similar to 3 X 10(10) s(-1)) due to increased spatial separation and reduced electronic coupling between the dye and the surface. In dye-sensitized solar cells, the TiO2-B-M-RuP devices exhibit a notably lower J(sc) but higher V-oc compared to TiO2-RuP with even lower photocurrents for Cu-II, Fe-II, and Mn-II bilayers presumably at least in part due to competitive quenching of the excited state by the metal ion. The increases in V-oc are offset by the decrease in J(sc); thus, the overall efficiency of the bilayer devices is lower than the that of the parent, monolayer device.",,,,"Hanson, Kenneth/H-4314-2019; Sykora, Milan/N-5743-2019","Sykora, Milan/0000-0002-1747-0709; Hanson, Kenneth/0000-0001-7219-7808; Ogunsolu, Omotola/0000-0002-9446-3027",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-7447,,,,,10-May,2018,122,18,,,,,9835,9842,,10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b02387,,,,,,,,WOS:000432477400012,,,,,

Time-resolved spectroscopic measurements on C294 and the model dye C272 indicated that the elevation of the HOMO energy level decreased the kinetics and yield of hole injection owing to a reduction in the driving force and that the shortened excited-state lifetime caused by the narrowing of the energy gap was unfavorable for electron injection.

Unfortunately, however, the UCNPs combined with the native form of NIR dye are of little use for biological imaging in the NIR-I or NIR-II window as the dye- sensitization process is mostly carried out in non-aqueous media. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose to employ a water-dispersible NIR-II dye (IR-1061) to sensitize core/active shell UCNPs and achieve sufficiently high upconversion quantum efficiency in aqueous media. We have particularly focused on achieving strong NIR-I emission rather than visible upconversion emission as the latter suffers from the problem of shallow tissue penetration depth. For this purpose, Pluronic F68-encapsulated water-dispersible IR-1061 dye was coupled with polyethyleneimine (PEI)-coated NaYF4:Tm3+/Yb3+@NaYF4:Yb3+ core/active shell UCNPs. We thus achieved a 283% enhancement in NIR-I emission (i.e. 800 nm emission of Tm3+ ion) from water-dispersible NIR-II dye-sensitized core/active shell UCNPs via doping of ytterbium ions (Yb3+) in the UCNP shell, which bridged the energy transfer from the dye to the UCNP core. Practically, in comparison with the native form of the dye, this water-dispersible dye can also efficiently harvest irradiation energy, which is nonradiatively transferred to Yb3+ ions in the shell and subsequently to Yb3+ ions in the core. The latter sensitizes Tm3+ ions positioned in the core, thus generating upconversion luminescence from the UCNPs. We envision that our water-dispersible NIR-II dye-sensitized core/active shell UCNPs are not only potential candidates for a broad spectrum of photonic applications but that they will also find new opportunities in several biological applications.",,,,"Hazra, Chanchal/K-2665-2015; Ullah, Sajjad/D-9782-2014","Caetano, Lais/0000-0002-6597-8697; Ullah, Sajjad/0000-0001-9931-690X",,,,,,,,,,,,2050-7526,2050-7534,,,,7-May,2018,6,17,,,,,4777,4785,,10.1039/c8tc00335a,,,,,,,,WOS:000431430500023,,,,,

Furthermore, we performed a detailed analysis on their geometrical and electronic properties, including molecular structures, energy levels, light harvesting efficiency (LHE), driving force (Delta G(inject)), regeneration (Delta G(regen)),electron dipole moments (mu(normal)), intermolecular electron transfer and dye/(TiO2)(38) system electron transitions. The results of calculation reveal that double coumarin donors in ME13 are promising functional groups for butterfly type organic dye sensitizers. It is expected that the design of double donors can provide a new strategy and guidance for the investigation in high efficiency dye-sensitized devices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Phthalocyanines (Pcs) are potentially interesting sensitizers having absorption in the red side of the optical spectrum and known to be efficient electron donors. However, the efficiencies of Pc-sensitized DSSCs are lower than that of the best DSSCs, which is commonly attributed to the aggregation tendency of Pcs.

The samples were prepared on a standard fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates covered by a porous layer of TiO2 nanoparticles, functionalized by a Pc sensitizer and filled by a hole transporting material (Spiro-MeOTAD). The study demonstrates that the aggregation can be suppressed gradually by using co-adsorbates, such as chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and oleic acid, but rather high concentrations of co-adsorbate is required. Gradually, a few times improvement of quantum efficiency was observed at sensitizer/co-adsorbate ratio Pc/CDCA = 1:10 and higher.

Investigating the origin of this difference is a critical step for further improving the performance of plastic dye-sensitized solar cells. In this study, an optimized ternary viscous titania paste without the addition of organic binders enables the fabrication of efficient dye-sensitized solar cells with a low-temperature process. Therefore, the electron-transport behavior of dye-sensitized solar cells can be directly compared with those prepared with the high-temperature sintering technique. In addition to the structural and optical differences, the hot compressed photoanode of dye-sensitized solar cells have an electron diffusion coefficient that is 2 times smaller and a recombination time that is 6 times shorter than those of the high-temperature sintered cells, suggesting inadequate interparticle connections and more recombination events. These results indicate that electron transport and recombination are still the key factors governing the performance of low-temperature fabricated dye-sensitized solar cells.

In this study, we focus on accelerated thermal stressing of industrial DSCs at 85 degrees C for up to 290 h. The overall reduction of the DSCs efficiency (h) under this harsh stress is relatively small (about 20%) due to nearly 10% decrease in the Short Circuit Current (J(sc)) and Open Circuit Voltage (V-oc) and mainly occurs in the initial stage (within the first 54 h). The ageing mechanism is studied by combining the electrical, dc (J-V) and ac (impedance) characterization of the cells with their in-situ spectroscopic analysis under bias by micro-Raman. A sharp decrease in the recombination resistance at the sensitized photoelectrode/electrolyte interface is identified for the aged cell which is ascribed to trapping of triiodide species in the photoelectrode and accounts for the V-oc drop of the cells.

Therefore, the results from electrochemical measurements prove that the electrocatalytic activity of the optimized NiSe/NiSe2 counterelectrode is higher than that of platinum electrode. As a result, the DSC with the optimized NiSe/NiSe2 counterelectrode yields a remarkable photoelectrical conversion efficiency of 7.78%, which is larger than that of the DSC based on platinum electrode (7.09%).

The cell with TiO2 electrode sensitized by mixed dye gives short circuit current density (Jsc) = 4.01 mA/cm(2), open circuit voltage (Voc) = 0.67 V, fill factor (FF) = 0.60 and energy conversion efficiency (eta) of 2.02%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0925-3467,1873-1252,,,,MAY,2018,79,,,,,,296,301,,10.1016/j.optmat.2018.03.056,,,,,,,,WOS:000434005800041,,,,,

To be able to predict the dye regeneration efficiency by the electrolyte this paper provides a facile way to design high-efficiency sensitizers for DSSC. This paper proposes, for the first time, a simple and ingenious way to identify the dye regeneration sites and their relative efficiencies when a specific electrolyte is used. Two steps are proposed to identify the dye regeneration sites and their relative regeneration efficiencies: (1) drawing all the resonance structures of the oxidized dye to determine the regeneration sites, and (2) choosing the most favored site for dye regeneration as the chemically softest (when the redox couple used is soft I-/I-3(-) pair) and the least spatially hindered site. The regeneration sites identified by the resonance structures are consistent with the -LUSO ( lowest unoccupied spin orbital) distribution, which is generally used for identifying the dye regeneration sites, calculated with DT-DFT theory. The relative dye regeneration efficiency and photovoltaic performance of both ruthenium and metal-free organic dyes predicted by the method reported here are supported by experimental data and the proposed dye regeneration mechanism. Several types of dye molecules are used to demonstrate the correctness of this new tool.

The results showed that the sensitizer (YK-1) based on carboxylic acid displayed a higher conversion efficiency of 0.064% under AM 1.5 solar conditions in p-DSCs. However, it was interesting that the hydroxamic acid based sensitizer (YK-2) on NiO photocathode displayed better performance in a hydrophilic environment over a broad pH range under visible-light irradiation because of a versatile covalent attachment to NiO surfaces. This may be ascribed to hydroxamic acid anchors, which have more sites interacting with the surface of NiO in aqueous solution. This study demonstrates that YK-2 containing hydroxamic acid anchoring group is a promising candidate to achieve highly efficient and stable activity for dye-sensitized PEC system.

However, the lack of a clear correlation between electrochemical signatures of copper complexes (i.e. half-wave potential and heterogeneous electron transfer rate) and photoelectrochemical performance of solar devices makes difficult the optimization of their coordination sphere. Therefore, to partially fill this gap and to elucidate the intrinsic correlation between the molecular architecture of these complexes and their electrochemical features, we prepared four Cu+/2+ redox couples in which the copper center is coordinated by two 1,10-phenanthrolines bearing various substituents in position 2. These complexes were well characterized, from both electrochemical and spectroscopic point of view, and tested as electron shuttles in lab-scale photoelectrochemical cells sensitized with two efficient pi-extended benzothiadiazole dyes. It appeared that 2-aryl-1,10-phenanthrolines effectively combine suitable optical and electrochemical properties. While a fast electron transfer kinetics generally positively affects the dye regeneration process, an optimal balance between dye regeneration efficiency, mass transport and heterogeneous electron transfer at both the counter electrode and at the TiO2 interface, must be achieved in order to optimize DSSC performance. Within our series, the top performer was [Cu(2-tolyl-1,10-phenanthroline)(2)](+/2+) which achieved a relative 20% and 15% improvement in power conversion efficiency (under 100 mW s(-1) simulated AM 1.5G illumination) with respect to control cells filled with [Co(bpy)(3)](2+/3+) (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine) and I-/I-3(-) electrolytes, respectively.

Si-H bonds can reduce metal ions and enable small metal nanoparticles grown on the surface of silicon nanowires, which can effectively prevent metal nanoparticles from agglomeration in the catalysis. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows that the adsorption energy of I atom on the Pt/Si interface is -0.8 eV, which is the optimal adsorption energy for triiodide reduction, indicating that Pt/Si is a perfect material for the counter electrode. The electrochemical characterizations and the photocurrent-voltage performance experimentally confirm that Pt/SiNW is a better counter electrode material than other metal/SiNW composites and Pt, which is in accordance with DFT calculations.

To circumvent this problem, we introduced a novel technology in which we covered the surfaces of interconnected nanoparticles of SnO2 by an ultra-thin layer of a wide band-gap semiconductor or an insulator where the thickness of the layer is similar to 1 nm or less such that electron injection from the excited dye molecules to the conduction band of the semiconductor nanoparticles is possible but injected electrons are incapable of penetrating the insulating barrier layer. In this way, we were able to suppress recombination significantly and such composite film based dye-sensitized solar cells gave efficiencies comparable to those based on TiO2 nanoparticles. We then realized that platinum used in dye-sensitized solar cell counter electrodes accounts for nearly 40% of the cost of these solar cells and hence limits their practical application. We then worked on alternative materials and found that carbon based counter electrodes can be tailored to give efficiencies closer to those of Pt counter electrode based solar cells. In extending this study we now worked on graphene as counter electrode material for composite SnO2/ZnO dye-sensitized solar cells.

This consists of: (a) back-transfer from the TiO2 to the oxidized dye and (b) intermolecular electron transfer between dyes. The latter is attributed to dye aggregation due to dimeric conformations. This leads to poor electron injection which decreases the photocurrent conversion efficiency. Most organic sensitizers are characterized by an Acceptor-Bridge-Donor (A-Bridge-D) arrangement that is commonly employed to provide charge separation and, therefore, lowering the unwanted back-transfer. Here, we address the intermolecular electron transfer by studying the dimerization and photovoltaic performance of a group of A-Bridge-D structured dyes. Specifically, eight famous sulfur containing -bridges were analyzed (A and D remained fixed). Through quantum mechanical and molecular dynamics approaches, it was found that the formation of weakly stabilized dimers is allowed. The dyes with covalently bonded and fused thiophene rings as Bridges, 6d and 7d as well as 8d with a fluorene, would present high aggregation and, therefore, high probability of recombination processes. Conversely, using TiO2 cluster and surface models, delineated the shortest bridges to improve the adsorption energy and the stability of the system. Finally, the elongation of the bridge up to 2 and 3 units and their photovoltaic parameters were studied. These results showed that all the sensitizers are able to provide similar photocurrent outcomes, regardless of whether the bridge is elongated.

XW31 exhibits a J(sc) of 22.06 mA cm(-2) as compared with that of 21.26 mA cm(-2) for XW29. Consequently, XW31 achieves a higher power conversion efficiency of 10.46% than that of 10.14% for XW29.

Therefore, the properties of the interfaces between the various components of the electrode (semiconductor/semiconductor, semiconductor/catalyst, or photoelectrode/electrolyte) affect the PEC performance of the composite material. Notably, surface trap states may hinder charge transfer and transport properties, and also cause Fermi pinning, affecting the quasi-Fermi level and onset potential under illumination, which may in turn influence the PEC performance of the corresponding tandem cells. In this study, plate-like WO3 array films prepared by an aqueous chemical growth method were employed to highlight the effect of interfacial properties on the performance of a WO3-based photoanode. The Mott Schottky and linear sweep voltammetry experiments prove the existence of surface trap states and Fermi pinning for pristine WO3, which are alleviated after an ""etching"" treatment and disappeared after surface passivation by a Ga2O3 layer. Both etching and passivation increase the oxygen evolution activity and the Faradaic efficiency for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). After loading a permeable catalyst (FeOOH), the photocurrent is further increased, and there is a synergistic effect between loading of the electrocatalyst with etching or passivation. The onset potentials of the samples follow the trends: etch-WO3/FeOOH < WO3/FeOOH <= WO3/Ga2O3/FeOOH < etch-WO3 < WO3 < WO3/Ga2O3, indicating that the interfacial properties have a significant effect on the PEC performance.

Moreover, the obtained ZnO nanorods exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity in decomposition of phenol under sunlight irradiation which is attributed to V-o.

Similarly, using the ruthenium dye N719 as sensitizer an efficiency increase from 5.31% to 6.23% is obtained.

Such a blocking film can minimise undesirable parasitic processes, for example, the back reaction of photoinjected electrons with the oxidized form of the redox mediator or with the holetransporting medium can be avoided. In the present work, thin, transparent, blocking TiO2 films are prepared by semi-automatic spray pyrolysis of precursors consisting of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) as the main component. The variation in the layer thickness of the sprayed films is achieved by varying the number of spray cycles. The parameters investigated in this work were deposition temperature (150, 300 and 450 degrees C), number of spray cycles (20-200), precursor composition (with/without deliberately added acetylacetone), concentration (0.05 and 0.2 M) and subsequent post-calcination at 500 degrees C. The photo-electrochemical properties were evaluated in aqueous electrolyte solution under UV irradiation. The blocking properties were tested by cyclic voltammetry with a model redox probe with a simple one-electron-transfer reaction. Semi-automatic spraying resulted in the formation of transparent, homogeneous, TiO2 films, and the technique allows for easy upscaling to large electrode areas. The deposition temperature of 450 degrees C was necessary for the fabrication of highly photoactive TiO2 films. The blocking properties of the as-deposited TiO2 films (at 450 degrees C) were impaired by post-calcination at 500 degrees C, but this problem could be addressed by increasing the number of spray cycles. The modification of the precursor by adding acetylacetone resulted in the fabrication of TiO2 films exhibiting perfect blocking properties that were not influenced by post-calcination. These results will surely find use in the fabrication of large-scale dye-sensitized and perovskite solar cells.",,,,"Kavan, Ladislav/F-5218-2014; Krysova, Hana/G-8016-2014","Kavan, Ladislav/0000-0003-3342-4603; ",,,,,,,,,,,,2190-4286,,,,,10-Apr,2018,9,,,,,,1135,1145,,10.3762/bjnano.9.105,,,,,,,,WOS:000430355700001,29719764,,,,

The experimental results indicate that the nanocubes are single phase, nearly stoichiometric composition and a mean size of 200 nm. From outstanding electrochemical performance, Cu2WS4 CE exhibits excellent catalytic activity towards iodine redox couples in the electrolyte and fast electron-transfer at the interfaces of CE/electrolyte owing to its larger surface area, more conductive network, lower charge transfer resistance and strong adherence of CWS nanocubes on substrate compare to Pt. The CWS-based cell displays a higher power conversion efficiency of 8.94% than that with Pt CE (8.00%), as well as an excellent reversibility/durability with long-term stability.

The alteration at the 4-position of coumarin was carried out by substituting H atom by chlorine (-Cl), piperidine (-NC5H10), and cyano group (-CN) to study the effect of substitution on the efficiency of the DSSCs. All the dyes were characterised by H-1-NMR and C-13-NMR spectroscopy and CHN analysis. The absorption and emission spectra of these coumarin dyes were recorded in eight different solvents and show positive solvatochromism. The TiO2-based DSSCs were fabricated using the four dyes and their photovoltaic properties were estimated. A maximum efficiency of 4.60% was obtained for the MC4 device, which has an electron-withdrawing cyano group at the 4-position of coumarin, while 2.64% efficiency was obtained for the MC1 device, which has only hydrogen at the 4-position. The efficiencies of the MC2 and MC3 devices lie between those of MC1 and MC4, suggesting the significance of substitution at the 4-position. The introduction of a cyano group, which acts as an electron trap, increases the electron-withdrawing capacity of the dye; thus, more electron density is withdrawn from the donor, resulting in enhanced efficiency. These dyes were studied by using density functional theory (DFT) and time dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) to obtain the vertical excitation, HOMO-LUMO energy levels, band gap and electron distribution in the ground and excited state.

Post-treatment process significantly enhanced the open-circuit photovoltage and short-circuit photocurrent density, resulting in an increase in the photoelectric conversion efficiency (eta) of dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). Ag modification increased the optical absorption of dye through the localized surface plasmons and improved the interfacial connection between TiO2 particles for expediting the electron transport, but at the expense of decreasing dye adsorption. There was no appreciable change in the adsorption amount of dye after the formation of cTiO(2)-Ag on photoanode.

The results show that the presence of GOS NFs significantly increases the diffusivity and conductivity of the PEs. The introduction of 1.5 wt % of GOS NFs decreases the charge-transfer resistance at the Pt-counter electrode/electrolyte interface (R-pt) and increases the recombination resistance at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface (R-ct). QS-DSSC utilizing 1.5 wt % GOS NFs can achieve an energy conversion efficiency (8.78%) higher than that found for their liquid counterpart and other reported polymer gel electrolytes/GO NFs based DSSCs.

Device-relevant calculations on these three short-listed dyes and the parent dye C281 were then performed, whereupon the dye molecules were adsorbed onto anatase TiO2 surfaces to form the DSSC working electrode. Associated DSSC device characteristics of this dye center dot center dot center dot TiO2 interfacial structure were determined. These include the light-harvesting efficiency, the number of injected electrons, the electron-injection lifetime, and the quantum-energy alignment of the adsorbed dye molecule to that of its device components. In turn, these calculated parameters enabled the derivation of the DSSC device performance parameters: short-circuit current density, J(SC), incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency, IPCE, and open-circuit voltage, V-OC. Thus, we demonstrate a systematic ab initio approach to screen rationally designed D-A dyes with respect to their potential applicability in high-performance DSSC devices.",,,,"Cole, Jacqueline/C-5991-2008; Cao, Dapeng/G-2808-2010","Cao, Dapeng/0000-0002-6981-7794",,,,,,,,,,,,2574-0962,,,,,APR,2018,1,4,,,,,1435,1444,,10.1021/acsaem.7b00154,,,,,,,,WOS:000458705400007,,,,,

However, the emergence of efficient planar devices as well as measurements of exciton binding energy in the range of 10-100 meV suggest that they may be free carrier-based. In this work, the free carrier model is confirmed by building graphene/perovskite Schottky barrier solar cells, analogous to conventional metal/semiconductor Schottky barrier solar cells.

The electrical conductivity improvement was ascribed to the excess Sn atoms in the nanoparticles which can fill the place of zinc atoms (Zn2+) or occupy interstitial sites in the zinc stannate lattice and lead to creation of more free electrons. Subsequently, the resultant nanoparticles were used as photoanode material. The fabricated dye-sensitized solar cells with 1.8 molar ratio of ZnO to SnO2 displayed better photovoltaic performance.

The DSSC with NiCo2S4 BHSs under 100 mW cm(-2) irradiation possessed a power conversion efficiency of 9.49% (Pt, 8.30%). Besides, NiCo2S4 BHSs as a HER catalyst also possessed a small onset overpotential (27.9 mV) and a low overpotential (89.7 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) under alkaline conditions.

A key bottleneck in the development of these architectures is the low efficiency of the photocathodes, leading to small current densities. Herein, we report a new design principle for highly active photocathodes that relies on the outer-sphere reduction of a substrate from the dye, generating an unstable radical that proceeds to the desired product. We show that the direct reduction of dioxygen from dye-sensitized nickel oxide (NiO) leads to the production of H2O2. In the presence of oxygen and visible light, NiO photocathodes sensitized with commercially available porphyrin, coumarin, and ruthenium dyes exhibit large photocurrents (up to 400 mu A/cm(2)) near the thermodynamic potential for O-2/H2O2 in near-neutral water. Bulk photoelectrolysis of porphyrin-sensitized NiO over 24 h results in millimolar concentrations of H2O2 with essentially 100% faradaic efficiency. To our knowledge, these are among the most active NiO photocathodes reported for multiproton/multielectron transformations. The photoelectrosynthesis proceeds by initial formation of superoxide, which disproportionates to H2O2. This disproportionation-driven charge separation circumvents the inherent challenges in separating electron-hole pairs for photocathodes tethered to inner sphere electrocatalysts and enables new applications for photoelectrosynthesis cells.",,,,,"Jung, Onyu/0000-0002-1165-6959; Mayer, James/0000-0002-3943-5250; Pegis, Michael/0000-0001-6686-1717",,,,,,,,,,,,0002-7863,,,,,21-Mar,2018,140,11,,,,,4079,4084,,10.1021/jacs.8b00015,,,,,,,,WOS:000428356000038,29463086,,,,

DSSCs have notable advantages such as low cost, easy fabrication process and being eco-friendly in nature. The progress of DSSCs over the last 20 years has been nearly constant due to some limitations, like poor long-term stability, narrow absorption spectrum, charge carrier transportation and collection losses and poor charge transfer mechanism for regeneration of dye molecules. The main challenge for the scientific community is to improve the performance of DSSCs by using different approaches, like finding new electrode materials with suitable nanoarchitectures, dyes in composition with promising semiconductors and metal quantum dot fluorescent dyes, and cost-effective hole transporting materials (HTMs). This review focuses on DSSC photo-physics, which includes charge separation, effective transportation, collection and recombination processes.

As the critical component of DSSCs, photosensitizers play an important role in photon capturing, charge generation and separation, as well as electron injection at the semiconductor interface. Efforts on the design and synthesis of photosensitizers are thus an effective and straightforward way to tune the photovoltaic performance. In this article, three novel phenothiazine- based D-A-p-A type organic dyes (JY50 similar to JY52) featuring benzothiadiazole units as auxiliary acceptors have been synthesized and applied in DSSCs. The introduction of auxiliary acceptor would take the advantages of the optimization of the dyes' energy levels and light absorption. To get more impressive device efficiency, 4-hexylbenzene group was decorated onto phenothiazine donor and has proved to be effective for improving the molar absorption coefficient and suppressing the charge recombination, finally resulting in the enhancement of photocurrent (J(sc)) and photovoltage (V-oc). In order to investigate the effect of different electron acceptor/anchoring group, benzoic acid and cyanoacrylic acid, which are widely applied in porphyrin-based dyes and metal-free organic dyes, respectively, are employed here to construct the target dyes. As we can see from the obtained photovoltaic performance data, dyes (JY50 and JY51) with benzoic acid anchor seem more beneficial to gain a higher Voc, this may be ascribed to its nearly vertical adsorption geometry on the TiO2 interface and the resulting decrease of the charge recombination. As for dye (JY52) with cyanoacrylic acid anchor, a better J(sc) value is achieved because cyanoacrylic acid endows dye an extended conjugated system and an enhanced intramolecular charge transfer. Under AM 1.5 solar light conditions, the dye JY51 with 4-hexylbenzene unit and benzoic acid acceptor exhibited the highest PCE of 7.61%, with Voc of 797 mV and Jsc of 14.21 mA.cm(-2).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0567-7351,,,,,15-Mar,2018,76,3,,,,,215,223,,10.6023/A17120543,,,,,,,,WOS:000430048900008,,,,,

Transparent active layers for ssDSSCs are obtained, which demonstrates the possibility for building integrated solar cells. The ssDSSCs with a worm-like ZnO morphology, exhibiting relatively better ordered interconnected three-dimensional structures and larger meso-pore sizes, show the highest power conversion efficiencies and almost 100% efficiency of charge separation and collection for the absorbed photons.

This work reports the synthesis of a novel counter electrode (CE) composed of WOx@WS2@carbon core-shell film and compares its electrical and electrocatalytic performances with other two CEs of WOx/carbon film and conventional Pt in the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The WOx@WS2@carbon CE was prepared by a sulfurization treatment of a mesoporous WOx/carbon film coated on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FFO) glass. The well-interconnected three-dimensional (3D) WS2 structure with coated carbon film provides high electrocatalytic activity and fast reaction kinetics for the reduction of triiodide to iodide due to its sufficient active sites on 3D WS2 framework containing surface edge-oriented nanosheets and the facile electron transfer and electrolyte diffusion via the continuously carbon layer. Photovoltaic performance tests indicate the DSSC device with the counter electrode of WOx@WS2@carbon core-shell achieved the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.71% compared favourably with the values of 6.00% from WOx/carbon CE and 7.34% from conventional Pt CE.

In this work a quasi-solid state (gel) electrolyte has been formed by incorporating a liquid electrolyte made with KI dissolved in ethylene carbonate (EC) and propylene carbonate (PC) co-solvent in poly (vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene) (PVdF-HFP) co-polymer nanofiber membrane prepared by electrospinning. SEM images of the electrolyte membrane showed the formation of a three-dimensional network of polymer nanofibers with diameters between 100 and 300 nm and an average membrane thickness of 14 mu m. The electrolyte was characterized by FTIR and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements. The DSSCs fabricated with this electrolyte were characterized by current-voltage and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. DSC thermograms revealed that the crystallinity of the PVdF-HFP nanofiber is 14% lower than that of the pure PVdF-HFP polymer while the FTIR spectra showed a reduced polymer-polymer interaction in the nano fiber based gel electrolyte. The DSSCs fabricated with nanofiber based gel electrolyte showed an energy conversion efficiency of 5.36% under 1.5 a. m. solar irradiation, whereas the efficiency of the DSSC made with the liquid electrolyte based cell was 6.01%.

High crystalline structure of graphite possesses few defects and porous channels. In the proposed research, cpG is fabricated by sonicating graphite in cationized enzyme media followed by exfoliating in the activated charcoal filler. The cationic lipase solution distributed positive surface charges over a bare graphitic sheet, and sonication with activated charcoal filler divulges porous channels along graphite exfoliated matrix structure. The charcoal doping in graphite was modified with the different charcoal content percentage ranging from 0 to 100%. The cationized porous graphite (cpG) material possess high surface area, pore volume and conductivity leads to high photoresponse and electrocatalytic reaction. As photocatalyst, the proposed graphite provide fast degradation of methylene blue dye observed by UV-Vis spectrophotometer. As cathode for dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSCs), cpG provides high electrocatalytic activity with low charge transfer resistance (R-CT = 0.95 Omega) and high photovoltaic performance with 9.59% efficiency. The positive charge distribution over graphite sheet attracts plenty of negative iodide ions present in the electrolyte, provide fast reduction-oxidation reaction. Furthermore, porous charcoal filler doping accepts a large amount of gel electrolyte, and fasten interfacial reaction between electrolyte and CE.

In comparision with a blank electrolyte (0.35 M lithium iodide, 0.035 M iodine and 0.01 M guanidium thiocyanate in a much less leakage and volatile solvent such as propylene carbonate, PC-liquid), addition of 0.5 M phenylnicotinonitrile derivative caused an increase in the open-circuit potential (V-oc) of 209 mV but a decrease in the short current density (J(c)) of 3.36mA/cm(2). The increase could be attributed to the negative shift of the conduction bond of TiO2 semiconductor potential (V-oc, similar to 34% of the voltage increase) and to the increase of the photo-conversion efficiency (PCE, similar to 21% of the efficiency increase). The decrease in J(sc) was because of the reduction of dye regeneration and the catalytic activity of the photocathode in electrolyte regeneration.

In order to comprehend the role of dye geometry on the above properties, we have devised the pyrene based D-pi-A dyes namely 2-cyano-3-(5-pyren-1-yl-furan-2-yl)-acrylic acid (PFCC) and 2-cyano-3-(5-pyren1-ylethynyl-furan-2-yl)-acrylic acid (PEFCC).

The varied pi-spacers were furan and ethynyl furan. The influences of the ethynyl spacer on the energy levels, light absorption, dynamics of excited states and photovoltaic properties of the DSCs were systematically investigated via theoretical calculations and spectroscopic measurements. UV-visible absorption spectral measurements indicated that the introduction of the ethynyl spacer enhances the molar absorptivity of a dye (PEFCC) in the order of 2, but does not shift the absorption range, which is consistent with the results obtained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The theoretical analysis indicated that the charge transfer transition is mainly constituted of the HOMO to the LUMO that were found to be located on donor and acceptor segments, respectively, which is supportive for efficient charge separation and electron injection processes. TDDFT calculations highlighted that the LUMO of the PEFCC dye is more stabilized by the incorporation of the ethynyl group between the pyrene and furan moieties that aid to inject electrons efficiently into TiO2 thereby resulting in an enhanced power conversion efficiency of 2.47% when compared to the PFCC dye. Notably, the overall conversion efficiency of the PEFCC dye reached 60% with respect to that of an N719-based device (4.12%) fabricated under similar conditions.

The hike in the efficiency comes from the increased short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage due to reduced dye aggregation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies reveal that the life-time of the injected electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 and charge recombination rate at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface mainly dependent on nature of pi-linker and acceptor of the dyes.",,,,"ZHU, XUNJIN/B-8965-2015","ZHU, XUNJIN/0000-0001-7929-6964",,,,,,,,,,,,2365-6549,,,,,7-Mar,2018,3,9,,,,,2558,2564,,10.1002/slct.201702652,,,,,,,,WOS:000426765100020,,,,,

A working photoelectrode made from TiO2 nanoparticles with an average particle size (10-40 nm) that is coated on Florine doped tin-oxide substrate, was prepared via a simple and low cost hydrothermal method. A detailed structural and morphological analysis of the TiO2 photoactive electrode was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), diffuse reflectance spectrometer, transmission electron microscope (TEM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Complete photovoltaic characteristics including (current, voltage, outpower, and responsivity) of the natural anthocyanin based dye sensitized solar cell have been investigated under different illumination intensity ranging from 10 to 100 mW.cm(-2). The cell responsivity and efficiency of the fabricated solar cell under different illumination intensity were found to be in the range (R = 15.6-23.8 mA.W-1 and eta = 0.13-0.25) at AM = 1.5 conditions. This study is important for enhancing the future applications of the promising DSSC technology. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.
