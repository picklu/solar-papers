Electron donating- or -withdrawing substituents on the phenanthroline ligands which are coordinated to the Co metal, directly influence the electron density on the Co metal, due to good communication between these substituents and the Co metal via the aromatic rings of the heterocyclic substituted phenanthroline-Co(II) complexes, leading to either more negative (for electron donating groups) or more positive (for electron withdrawing groups) redox potentials respectively.

Achieving higher photovoltage without compromising photocurrent helped copper electrolyte attract considerable attention among alternate electrolytes currently employed in DSCs. The very small reorganization energy between Cu(I) and Cu(II) and small molecular size helped copper achieve unit regeneration efficiency, with a driving force as low as 100 mV and a high diffusion coefficient (D-n), leading to better diffusion length (L-n) and charge collection efficiency (eta(cc)). Mass transport issues were also found to be improved for copper electrolytes in comparison with cobalt electrolytes. As it is inert to silver and other electrical contacts used in DSCs and possesses higher mobility even in solid state, copper-based electrolyte is a promising candidate to spearhead the commercialization of dye solar technology.

Made from inexpensive, earth-abundant, and non-toxic materials, DSCs perform best at low light intensity. So far, issues such as leakage of the liquid electrolyte and its corrosive nature have limited the commercialization of this technology. To overcome these limitations, solid-state DSCs (ssDSCs) - in which the liquid electrolyte is replaced by a solid material - have been developed. For many years their efficiencies have been poor, preventing them from being widely employed. In the past six years, however, research efforts have led them to rival with their liquid counterparts. Here, we will review recent advancements in the field of ssDSCs.

The resultant energy-gap shrinkage endows the new dye with a red-shifted absorption peak concomitant with a higher molar absorption coefficient, while this style of downward movement of the LUMO energy level does not exert a distinct impact on the electron injection efficiency from photoexcited dye molecules into titania, which endows the new dye with an enhanced photocurrent output, bringing forth an efficiency improvement up to 12.0% under 100 mW cm(-2) simulated AM1.5 conditions.",,,,,"Zhang, Min/0000-0002-0275-9497",,,,,,,,,,,,2050-7488,2050-7496,,,,21-Nov,2018,6,43,,,,,21493,21500,,10.1039/c8ta08363k,,,,,,,,WOS:000449701900028,,,,,

The small quantity of platinum in the filaments of used thermocouples, thousands of which are discarded each year by metal foundries, can be economically recovered by conversion to chloroplatinic acid hydrate, an 'added value' product, which can then be used in the fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cell counter-electrodes. 91% recovery of platinum from filaments as chloroplatinic acid hydrate has been achieved by aqua regia digestion of manually isolated filaments. Cost-benefit analysis shows the proposed process derives sufficient value to cover landfill costs for what is left of the waste thermocouples after platinum removal; provide similar to 5 days employment; and provide 63% materials cost savings for electrode preparation in comparison to purchasing commercially available chloroplatinic acid hydrate.

DSSCs are characterized by their durability, easy handling and ability to perform better under diverse lighting conditions which makes them an ideal choice for indoor applications. However, DSSCs suffer from several limitations including low efficiencies, susceptibility to electrolyte leakage under extreme weather conditions, and the need for expensive materials and fabrication techniques which limits their large-scale industrial applications. Addressing these limitations through efficient design and manufacturing techniques are critical in ensuring that the DSSCs transform from the current small-scale laboratory levels to sizeable industrial production. This research attempts to address some of these significant limitations by introducing the concepts of nature-inspired fractal-based design followed by the additive manufacturing process to fabricate cost-effective, flexible counter electrodes for DSSCs. The new conceptual fractal-based design counter electrodes overcome the limitations of conventional planar designs by significantly increasing the number of active reaction sites which enhances the catalytic activity thereby improving the performance. The fabrication of these innovative fractal designs is realized through cost-effective manufacturing techniques including additive manufacturing and selective electrochemical co-deposition processes. The results of the study suggest that the fractal-based counter electrodes perform better than conventional designs.

The first application of porphyrin for sensitization of nanocrystaline TiO2 can be traced back to 1993 by using [tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrinato] zinc(II) with an overall conversion efficiency of 2.6%. After 10 years efforts, Officer and Gratzel improved this value to 7.1%. Later in 2009, by constructing porphyrin sensitizer with an arylamine as donor and a benzoic acid as acceptor, Diau and Yeh demonstrated that this donor-acceptor framwork porphyrins could attain remarkable photovoltaic performance. Now the highest efficiencies of DSSC are dominated by donor-acceptor porphyrins, reaching remarkable values around 13.0% with cobalt-based electrolytes. This achievement is largely contributed by the structural development of donor and acceptor groups within push-pull framwork. In this review, we summarized and discussed the developement of donor-acceptor porphyrin sensitizers and their applications in DSSC. A dicussion of the correlation between molecular structure and the spectral and photovoltaic properties is the major target of this review. Deeply dicussion of the substitution group, especially on porphyrin's meso-position were presented.

In terms of the materials used, transition-metal complexes with the unique features of the transition metal centers represent a large group of candidates, showing high performance in energy conversion technologies. However, the commonly used transition metals, like Pt(II), Ir(III) and Ru(II), are expensive and of relatively low abundance. Concerning elemental sustainability and marketability, some abundant and cheaper metals should be investigated and further developed to replace these precious metals. Cu(I) complexes have shown their potentiality in solar energy harvesting and light emitting applications, due to their well-studied photophysics and structural diversity. In addition, copper is one of the earth abundant metals with less toxicity, which makes it competitive to precious transition metals. As a result, a series of rational molecular engineering has been developed to boost the device performance of copper complexes.

For the purpose of designing efficient cosensitizers, we herein report systematically optimized dyes XC1-XC5 employing a triphenyl-amine donor, a benzothiadiazole moiety as the auxiliary acceptor, and a benzoic acid acceptor. One hexyl and four hexyloxy groups were introduced, and an ethynylene moiety was introduced between the donor and the auxiliary acceptor to afford XC1. To further extend the absorption wavelength, a second ethynylene moiety was introduced between the acceptor and the auxiliary acceptor to afford XC2. XC3 and XC4 were designed by introducing one and two methyl substituents, respectively, into the meta-positions of the anchoring carboxyl group. XC5 was further synthesized by inserting a cyano substituent into one of the ortho-positions of the carboxyl group with the purpose to strengthen the intramolecular charge-transfer effect and thus broaden the absorption wavelength. As expected, compared with the J(sc) (14.29 mA.cm(-2)) of XC1, the corresponding J(sc) values for XC2 XC5 were enhanced to 16.50, 16.95, 16.73, and 17.74 mA.cm(-2), respectively. Moreover, XC4 exhibits the highest V-oc of 770 mV owing to the presence of a maximum of seven chains, which can effectively suppress dye aggregation. As a result, compared with XC1, XC2 XC5 exhibit improved efficiencies of 8.67, 9.05, 8.78, and 9.30%, respectively. In addition, the efficiencies of XC3 and XC5 were further enhanced by cosensitizing them with our previously reported porphyrin dye XW28 under various conditions. Finally, a remarkable efficiency of 10.50% was achieved for the cells cosensitized with XC5 and XW28. These results indicate that the combination of good planarity of the extended D-pi-A framework with multiple alkoxy/alkyl chains may compose an effective optimizing strategy for designing and synthesizing excellent cosensitizers for porphyrins.",,,,"?, ??/B-3384-2009; Zhao, Shuangliang/B-6139-2017","Zhao, Shuangliang/0000-0002-9547-4860",,,,,,,,,,,,1944-8244,,,,,14-Nov,2018,10,45,,,,,38880,38891,,10.1021/acsami.8b12883,,,,,,,,WOS:000451100500023,30358387,,,,

To achieve this goal, a critical recombination route which is usually inhibited by the TiCl4-derived blocking layers (BLs), that is, charge transfer at the fluorine-doped tin oxide substrate/electrolyte interface, is of concern. In this study, we demonstrate that because of low surface coverage, the conventional TiCl4 BLs are unable to suppress such electron leakage, thus limiting the photovoltaic performance of Co(bpy)(3)(2+/3+)-mediated DSSCs (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine) under ambient lighting. On the other hand, by introducing compact BLs prepared by spray pyrolysis, the DSSCs show lower dark current and operate efficiently not only under high intensity sunlight but also under ambient light conditions. The better blocking function of the compact BL is verified by the cyclic voltammetry; other thin-film preparation methods, except for the common TiCl4 treatment, are anticipated to realize a similar blocking effect. This study illustrates that dense thin film with a predominant blocking function is highly required as the BL for DSSCs under low-light conditions, and this concept will pave the way for more development of indoor DSSCs.",,,,,"Liu, I-Ping/0000-0002-7380-4777",,,,,,,,,,,,1944-8244,,,,,14-Nov,2018,10,45,,,,,38900,38905,,10.1021/acsami.8b13181,,,,,,,,WOS:000451100500025,30338984,,,,

Herein, we have designed and synthesised four novel porphyrin sensitizers tethered with a triphenylimidazole group as the donor, a porphyrin macrocycle as the -spacer and 4-ethynyl phenyl (LG15), 5-ethynylthiophene (LG16), 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD)-phenyl (LG17), and BTD-thiophene (LG18) as auxiliary acceptors and either a carboxylic acid or cyanoacrylic acid anchoring group, which resembles the structure of a donor--bridge-acceptor (D--A). The absorption spectra of LG17 and LG18 are red-shifted, when compared to LG15 and LG16, due to the presence of extended -conjugation of the BDT group in its molecular structure. The red-shifted absorption spectra of LG17 and LG18 result in highest efficiency of 10.11% and 10.51%, respectively. Optical and electrochemical properties, and Density Functional Theory calculations of LG15-LG18, suggested that LG18 exhibits strong absorption and optimized lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) aids the injection of electrons very effectively from the excited state of the dye into the TiO2 conduction band. Both LG17 and LG18 exhibit broad incident to photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) and the onset extends up to 950 nm, with >80% at 700 nm. Current density-voltage (J-V) curves of LG15-LG18 revealed that LG17 and LG18 exhibit highest short-circuit current density of 20.64 and 21.43 mA cm(-2) resulting in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.11% and 10.51%, respectively, in a liquid I-/I-3(-) redox couple electrolyte.

Time-independent B3LYP density functional calculations were performed to assign vibrational bands and determine their respective transition dipole moments. The transient absorption spectral band at 1327 cm(-1), assigned to a symmetric carboxylate stretch, showed significant anisotropy. A rapid anisotropy increase (tau(1) approximate to 2 ps) was tentatively assigned to vibrational and solvent relaxation, considering the excess energy available after the excited singlet-triplet conversion. Thereafter, the anisotropy decayed to zero with a time constant tau(2) approximate to 240 ps, which was assigned to the rotational correlation time of the complex in deuterated acetonitrile. No other distinctive changes to the anisotropy were observed and the amplitude of the slow component at time zero agrees well with that predicted for a random mixture of MLCT localization on either of the two dcb ligands. The results therefore suggest that MLCT randomization over the two dcb ligands occurs on the sub-ps time scale. This is much faster than proposed by previous reports on the related N3 complex [Benko et al., J. Phys. Chem. B, 2004, 108, 2862, and Waterland et al., J. Phys. Chem.

DSSCs utilizing pi-conjugated polymers as p-type organic semiconductor and metal chalcogenides as sensitizers have attracted interest due to high absorbance and stability in comparison to DSSCs using conventional molecular dyes. Here, we report the study of the excited state and charge carrier dynamics in poly(hexylthiophene) (P3HT) with junction structures of FTO/TiO2/P3HT/PMMA/Ag and FTO/TiO2/Sb2S3/P3HT/PMMA/Ag, where fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) and silver (Ag) are used as electrodes and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is used as an insulating film. We measured electroabsorption spectra and the effects of external electric fields on photoluminescence (PL) of P3HT in these two different systems. Two PL bands emitted from different emitting states are observed in both of the systems. As the quadratic electric field effect, fluorescence quantum yield and lifetime become larger and longer in both of the PL bands, respectively, in the presence of external electric fields, indicating that nonradiative decay processes are depressed by applied electric fields in both of the systems. We also measured the linear electric field effects on PL of P3HT, and PL enhancement and quenching of PL intensity as well as lengthening and shortening of PL lifetime were observed, depending on the direction of the applied electric fields. It is shown that the mechanism of the linear field effect is different between the two emitting states in both of the systems; i.e., the population of the emitting state is affected by application of electric field for one PL band but not for the other PL band. The anisotropy of the field-induced change in PL with respect to the field direction of the applied electric fields can be explained in terms of the synergy effect between internal electric field which exists in the P3HT film and externally applied electric field on the charge separation of hot excitons generated following photoexcitation to free electron and hole (polaron) and on nonradiative decay rate of the PL emitting states.",,,,"Iimori, Toshifumi/B-5285-2015","Iimori, Toshifumi/0000-0003-2158-4378",,,,,,,,,,,,2574-0962,,,,,NOV,2018,1,11,,,,,6136,6151,,10.1021/acsaem.8b01171,,,,,,,,WOS:000458706700043,,,,,

The J-V characteristics shows that DSSCs with ZrO2 surface passivation produces significantly high open-circuit voltage of 0.87 V, short-circuit current density of 13.6 mA cm(-2), fill factor of 0.65 and a power conversion efficiency of similar to 6.97% under simulated AM1.5 solar irradiation. The higher onset potential in the dark, larger open-circuit potential under illumination, and an enhancement in power conversion efficiency strongly suggests an efficient suppression of back electron transfer from the conduction band of the hetero-phase junctions to the oxidized species in the electrolyte as established by dark and illuminated J-V characteristics. Thus, the oxidized dye molecules are readily regenerated by a redox couple dissolved in an electrolyte, allowing more photon excitation by dye molecules. The electrochemical impedance data extracts further provide additional evidence of the enhancement in photocurrent and lower charge carrier resistances observed in ZrO2/ZnO/TiO2/dye photoelectrode.

Photovoltaic cell efficiencies (PCEs) of the devices are in the range 0.08-1.54% under simulated AM 1.5 solar irradiation of 100 mW/cm(2), and the highest open-circuit voltage (V-oc) reaches 0.43 V. When the photovoltaic performance of the DSSC devices is compared, it indicates that PCEs assume the following: P1-Ru > > P2-Ru > P1 > P2. The PCE value of 1.54% is obtained with DSSC based on P1-Ru under AM irradiation (100 mW/cm(2)). DSSC based on the P1-Ru produced efficiency of 1.54% whereas DSSC-based P1 exhibits the device performance with an efficiency of 0.08% under illumination.

An approach to enhance panchromatic light absorption utilizes mixtures of complementary light-absorbing dyes as well as dyes with specific anchoring groups that facilitate interfacial charge transfer with TiO2. Dipole-dipole interactions between the dye molecules on the surface broaden the spectrum, which results in decreased DSSC device performance. However, controlled aggregation of dyes results in broadening the spectral profile along with enhanced photocurrent generation. To control the dye-dye interaction, dimeric dyes with different dipole lengths D-1-D-sq, D-sq-D(sq)were systematically designed and synthesized. The photophysical and electrochemical properties were evaluated and the E-HOMO and E-LUMO levels were determined; these energy levels determines the electron injection from E-LUMO of the dye to E-CB of TiO2 and regeneration of oxidized dye by the electrolyte, respectively. The absorption spectra of D-sq-D-sq, D-1-D-sq were broadened in solution compared to model dye D-sq; this indicates that the dye-dye interaction is prominent in solution. In D-1-D-sq excitation energy transfer between photoexcited D-1 and D-sq was explained by using Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET). The homodimeric dye showed a device performace of 2.8 % (V-oc 0.607, J(sc) 6.62 mA/cm(2), ff 69.3 %),whereas the heterodimeric dye D-1-D-sq showed a device performance of 3.9 % (V-oc 0.652 V, J(sc) 8.89 mA/cm(2), ff 68.8 %). The increased photocurrent for D-1-D(sq)is due to the panchromatic IPCE response compared to D-sq-D-sq. The increased V(oc)is due to the effective passivation of the TiO2 surface by the spirolinker, and the effective dipole moment that shifts the conduction band on TiO2. Hence, the open circuit potential, V-oc, for the devices prepared from D-sq, D-1-D-sq and D-sq-D(sq)were systematically modulated by controlling the intermolecular pi-pi and intramolecular dipole-dipole interactions of the dimeric dyes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2192-6506,,,,,NOV,2018,83,11,,,,,998,1007,,10.1002/cplu.201800450,,,,,,,,WOS:000451839200007,,,,,

Herein, the benzotriazole structure is finely tuned by fusing another electron deficient ring to the benzo unit leading to a series of benzotriazole-based electron-withdrawing heterocyclic rings including benzobitriazole, benzotriazolequinoxaline and benzotriazolethiadiazole. These together with benzotriazole are incorporated into the pi-bridge, respectively, as an auxiliary acceptor between the triphenylamine donor and the cyanoacrylic acid anchoring group for the construction of donor-auxiliary acceptor-n acceptor type sensitizers (LC-2, LC-3, LC-4 and LC-5). The benzobitriazole, benzotriazolequinoxaline and benzotriazolethiadiazole units show greatly increased electron-withdrawing capability and the corresponding sensitizers (LC-3, LC-4 and LC-5) exhibit broadened spectral response range compared to the reference benzotriazole-based dye LC-2 due to the decreased energy gap. Thus, the LC-3 and LC-4 cells exhibit significantly enhanced photocurrent density (J(sc)) values due to the greater light-harvesting abilities compared to LC-2. However, the electrochemical impedance analysis suggests the electron lifetime and charge recombination resistance are decreased due to the introduction of benzobitriazole, benzotriazolequinoxaline and benzotriazolethiadiazole, resulting in a slight loss of open-circuit voltage (V-oc).

The performance of DSSCs fabricated with SnO2 nanoparticle (NP)-based photoanode is compared with that of DSSCs made with a novel triple layered SnO2 photoanode of configuration FTO/NP/NF/NP. Thickness of the NF membrane is optimized to achieve the highest solar cell performance. Solar cells made with single layer SnO2 NP photoanode sensitized either by Eosin-Y dye or Indoline dye showed efficiencies of 0.3% and 2.02%, respectively, under the irradiance of 100mWcm(-2) (AM 1.5), while the corresponding devices with AlCl3-treated, triple layered photoanode showed efficiencies of 1.55 and 2.77%, respectively, under the same illumination. Accordingly, more than five-fold enhancement in overall efficiency is achieved in DSSCs by using this novel SnO2-based photoanode with the optimized thickness of the SnO2 nanofibre membrane and sensitized with Eosin-Y dye. Scanning electron microscopic studies revealed that the SnO2 nanofibre membrane consists of an interconnected network-like structure formed by the SnO2 nanofibres. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements on DSSCs made with these two types of photoanodes reveals that the series resistance of the DSSC made with the novel NP/NF/NP triple layered photoanode is significantly reduced. The observed higher electron lifetime determined from Bode plots shows that electron recombination is lower in the DSSCs made with the triple layered photoanode. Improved light harvesting by multiple scattering effects within the triple layered photoanode structure and the suppression of the electron recombination by Al2O3 sub-nanometer-sized coating around SnO2 appear to be the major factors for the enhancement in photo current density and efficiency.

However, 4-TBP reacts with the ruthenium dye N719 (bis (tetrabutylammonium) salt of the cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis (2,2'-bipyridyl-4,4'-dicarboxylato) ruthenium (II) (RuL2(NCS)2) complex at elevated temperatures, so the efficiency of the cells is reduced greatly. In this study, we tested 4,4'-dinonyl-2,2'-bipyridine (DNB) as a new nitrogen additive instead of 4-TBP in two types of electrolyte, i.e., liquid and ionic liquid, in order to improve the thermal stability of ruthenium dyes. The results showed that the reaction rate between DNB and N719 was relatively slow, and 10 times slower than that with 4-TBP at elevated temperatures. This clearly reduced the thermal degradation of N719. Two series of experiment were conducted at 80 degrees C from 0 to 1500 h with 7-8 samples per electrolyte. N719 and its degradation products were analyzed by High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with Ultraviolet/Visible (UV/Vis) detector and Mass spectrometiy (MS). After 1000 h, approximately 30% of N719 was degraded in the liquid electrolyte, whereas only 10% of the N719 was lost in the ionic electrolyte. DSCs prepared with 4-TBP and DNB to compare their photovoltaic performance. The results indicated that DSCs containing either 4-TBP or DNB had equivalent efficiencies of around 3.8%.

The removal of I-2 improved the long-term stability of DSSCs, but reduced the ionic diffusivity of electrolyte and thus the solar-to electricity efficiency of DSSCs. By introducing a suitable nanoparticle gelator into the electrolyte, the ionic diffusivity and the interfacial charge transfer could be enhanced due to the formation of 3-D networks that facilitate Grotthuss-type ion exchange.

The effect of varying precursor concentrations (3.2-12.6 mM on MoS2 basis) on the structure of the nanostructured thin films and their performance as DSSC-CEs was investigated. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a material with an infolded petal-like morphology.

In this work, we reported the synthesis of ZnO nano-flowers as well as its surface modification of with TiCl4 at different concentration.

This preferential surface modification of ZnO film facilitates the accumulation of large number of photo-injected electrons in the HOMO of the photoanode with rapid transfer of charge carriers to FTO via ZnO layer by lowering the recombination of photo-injected electrons with the redox electrolyte as well as oxidized dye.

A double-layer model with two energies is able to give good fitting of these experimental data. Four physicochemical parameters are involved in the fitting of the experimental adsorption isotherms such as the number of adsorbed dye molecules per site n, the density of receptor sites Nm and the two energetic parameters C-1 and C-2. From the numerical simulation, the number of molecules per site showed that the adsorbate molecules have two anchorage positions parallel and nonparallel respectively when pH and temperature vary. The variation of the adsorbed quantity at saturation with temperature shows the exothermic nature of aggregation process of the natural Gardenia yellow dye. In the case of variation of pH, the acidic conditions are more favorable for the adsorption process. The numerical values of the calculated adsorption energies have revealed that the Gardenia yellow dye is physisorbed onto TiO2 mesoporous. A new method based on Kelvin equation in liquid phase has been developed to determine the pore size distribution (PSD) of TiO2 mesoporous in comparison with other experimental measurements.

Then they were introduced to another hydrothermal process for branching. TiCl3 was used as the Ti source in this stage and hydrothermal time was changed in a wide range. Conic branches were grown on the surface of the TiO2 HSs while the spherical shapes were quite preserved. The base diameter and height of the TiO2 branches were controlled by autoclaving time. Three different photoanodes were fabricated and applied in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). The first one was a single-layer photoanode composed of hydrothermally grown TiO2 nanocrystals (NCs) with dominant size of 25 nm. The second electrode was a nanocrystalline TiO2 layer covered by a TiO2 HSs light scattering layer. The third type was a double-layer photoanode composed of TiO2 NCs sub-layer and hyper-branched TiO2 HSs over-layer. The influence of the morphology of the grown branches on the photovoltaic performance of the DSCs was investigated and discussed. A maximum energy conversion efficiency of 9.85% was achieved for the pioneer cell through the optimization of the branching process. This efficiency was increased about 39% and 9% compared to those of the DSCs with TiO2 NCs and TiO2 NCs/TiO2 HSs photoelectrodes.

Typically DSSCs employ toxic dyes such as metal-based porphyrins requiring complex synthesis. In contrast, natural pigments are environmentally and economically superior to synthetic dyes. However, narrow absorption spectra of natural pigments result in low efficiencies of the solar cells. Hence, co-sensitizing pigments with complementary absorption spectra, which increases the absorption band, is an attractive pathway to enhance the efficiency. In this paper, we report the performance of betanin-chlorophyll co-sensitized solar cell using betanin ((max)=535nm) and chlorophyll-a ((max)=435nm, 668nm), natural pigments having complementary absorption spectra. Density functional theory simulations were performed to verify that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital and the highest occupied molecular orbital levels of the dye molecules, are aligned appropriately with that of TiO2 and the redox electrolyte, respectively, which is necessary for optimal device performance. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic studies were performed to determine parameters corresponding to the charge transfer processes in the dye solar cells. Individual and co-sensitized solar cells were fabricated and the co-sensitized solar cell demonstrated a higher efficiency of 0.601% compared to efficiencies of 0.562% and 0.047% shown by betanin and chlorophyll solar cells, respectively.",,,,,"S, Sreeja/0000-0002-7688-7483",,,,,,,,,,,,2194-1459,2194-1467,,,,NOV,2018,7,4,,,,,,,25,10.1007/s40243-018-0132-x,,,,,,,,WOS:000444406800001,,,,,

In this regard, the linkage of Ru-II polypyridyl-type complexes with specific functional moieties is highly desirable to enhance their inherent photophysical properties, e.g., with a targeting function to achieve cell selectivity, or with a dye or redox-active subunits for energy- and electron-transfer. However, the classical approach of performing ligand syntheses first and the formation of Ru complexes in the last steps imposes synthetic limitations with regard to tolerating functional groups or moieties as well as requiring lengthy convergent routes. Alternatively, the diversification of Ru complexes after coordination (termed chemistry-on-the-complex'') provides an elegant complementary approach. In addition to the Click chemistry concept, the rapidly developing synthesis and purification methodologies permit the preparation of Ru conjugates via amidation, alkylation and cross-coupling reactions. In this regard, recent developments in chromatography shifted the limits of purification, e.g., by using new commercialized surface-modified silica gels and automated instrumentation. This review provides detailed insights into applying the ""chemistry-on-the-complex'' concept, which is believed to stimulate the modular preparation of unpreceded molecular assemblies as well as functional materials based on Ru-based building blocks, including combinatorial approaches.",,,,"Schubert, Ulrich S/B-5777-2009; Jager, Michael/A-4659-2013","Schubert, Ulrich S/0000-0003-4978-4670; Jager, Michael/0000-0003-0400-1812",,,,,,,,,,,,0306-0012,1460-4744,,,,21-Oct,2018,47,20,,,,,7577,7627,,10.1039/c8cs00096d,,,,,,,,WOS:000447501500010,30246196,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A bilayer nanostructure formed in the S-A phase and the T-/T-2 redox couple was intercalated between the smectic layers. Photovoltaic characterization revealed that the power conversion efficiency of the smectic T-/T-2 DSSC increased with the increase in temperature and reached 4.1% at 70 degrees C under simulated AM1.5G solar light. Regression analysis of temperature dependent charge diffusion coefficients and viscosities suggested that the charge transport in the T-/T-2 electrolyte was dominated by the Grotthuss-type exchange reaction. The lamellar nanostructure of T-/T-2 promoted the Grotthuss-type charge transport and improved the DSSC performance. The ordered arrangement of the redox couple offers an effective way to enhance the charge transport for the DSSC electrolytes unfavorable for physical ion diffusion. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Our results show that the CDCA coadsorbent plays an active role not only in stabilizing the dye/oxide system but also in preventing the surface tensile stress induced by the dye monolayer. The monolayer of the TY6 dye at high surface coverage in the absence of the coadsorbent applies tensile stress to the TiO2(001) surface because of the repulsive interactions between polar TY6 molecules. The induced tensile stress will shift both the valence band and the conduction band to higher energy, which reduces the energy gap between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of TY6 and the conduction band maximum (CBM) of TiO2(001). The reduced LUMO-CBM gap is detrimental to the charge injection efficiency of the DSSC, which results in a loss of power conversion efficiency.

Metalated conjugated organic molecules have also been shown to be good alternatives to the all organic congeners and have demonstrated good promise as solar cell materials in OSCs and dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).

Therefore, this study aims for the systematic comparison of three novel heteroleptic Cu(I) compounds, composed of xantphos (xant) as P<^>P ligand and different diimine ligands with an extended p-system in the backbone, with their structurally related Ru(II) analogues. In these Ru(II) photosensitizers [Ru(bpy)(2)(N<^>N)](2+) (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine) the same N<^>N ligands were used, namely, dipyrido[3,2-f:2',3'-h] quinoxaline (dpq) and dipyrido[3,2-a:2',3'-c] phenazine (dppz). To gain an in-depth understanding of the photoinduced charge transfer processes, the photophysical features of these complexes and their electrochemically oxidized/reduced species were studied by a combination of UV-vis absorption, resonance Raman and spectroelectrochemistry. (TD) DFT calculations were applied to qualitatively analyze these measurements. As a result, the heteroleptic Cu(I) complexes exhibit comparable charge transfer properties to their Ru(II) analogues, i.e. upon visible light excitation they undergo a metal-to-ligand charge transfer to the diimine ligand(s). In contrast, the reduced Cu(I)-and Ru(II)-dppz complexes show considerably different electronic transitions. The singly reduced Cu(I)-dppz complexes are able to accumulate an additional electron at the phenanthroline moiety upon blue-light excitation, which is beneficial for multi-electron-transfer reactions.

The fabricated solar cells were evaluated using UV-Vis spectroscopy, current-voltage (I-V) characteristics, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example where covalently linked ZnP-C-60 dyads have been used as chromophores in NiO-based DSCs. In an effort to examine whether the distance of the chromophore from the electron acceptor entity and/or the NiO surface affects the performance of the cells, a triazole ring was introduced as a spacer between ZnP and the two peripheral units C-60 and -COOH. The triazole ring was inserted between ZnP and C-60 in dyad C(60)trZnPCOOH, whereas both the anchoring group and C-60 were connected to ZnP through triazole spacers in C(60)trZnPtrCOOH, and dyad C60ZnPCOOH did not contain any triazole linker. Photophysical investigation performed by ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy in solution and on the NiO surface demonstrated that all the porphyrin-fullerene dyads exhibited long-lived charge-separated states due to electron shifts from the reduced porphyrin core to C-60. The transient experiments performed in solution showed that the presence of triazole ring influenced the photophysical properties of the dyads C(60)trZnPCOOH and C(60)trZnPtrCOOH and in particular, increased the lifetime of the charge-separated states compared to that of the C60ZnPCOOH dyad. On the other hand, the corresponding studies on the NiO surface proved that the triazole spacer has a rather moderate impact on the charge separation (NiO-ZnP center dot+-C-60(center dot-)) and charge recombination (NiO-(3)*ZnP-C-60) rate constants. All three dyads exhibited enhanced performance in terms of photovoltaic measurements with more than threefold increase compared to the reference compound PhtrZnPCOOH in which the C-60 acceptor is absent. Two different electrolytes were examined (I-3(-)/I- and Co-III/II) and in most cases, the presence of the triazole ring enhanced their photovoltaic performance.

Compared with traditional configurations, D-D'-A offers several advantages such as enrichment of the electron-donating ability, absorption spectral region, and molar extinction coefficient and inhibits dye aggregation. Hence, in this work, a novel D-D'-A-type dye has been designed and synthesized for DSC applications. In this configuration, substituted imidazole has been used as a primary donor, phenothiazine as an auxiliary donor, and cyanoacetic acid as an acceptor/anchoring group. Structural characterizations of a D-D'-A-type dye were done by using NMR and electron ionization-mass spectrometry. Photophysical, electrochemical, and computational studies were systematically performed to evaluate its electronic transitions, light-harvesting property, highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels, and redox behavior. The photophysical analysis indicates that the D-D'-A-type dye exhibits strong light-harvesting ability in the visible region and relatively high molar extinction coefficient (1.73 X 10(4) M-1 cm(-1)) because of strong intramolecular charge transfer from donor to acceptor of the dye. The intramolecular charge-transfer transition of the dye exhibited a negative solvatochromism and also displayed acidochromism. Moreover, theoretical calculations demonstrated fully separated HOMO and LUMO energy levels for the D-D'-A-type dye, which is supportive for efficient charge separation and electron injection. Further, free-energy calculations suggested efficient charge injection from the excited-state dye to the TiO2 conduction band. The intermolecular interaction and nature of binding on the TiO2 surface were probed by computed IR, HOMO/LUMO levels, and UV-vis absorption spectral studies. Because of the better molar extinction coefficient, longer singlet lifetime, higher light-harvesting efficiency, and sensitizing behavior, the DSC based on the D-D'-A-type dye has the overall power conversion efficiencies as 4.39%, which is comparable with the N719 dye (eta = 4.58%) under full sunlight (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm(-2)) irradiation.

The excellent SPR of GNR made it a promising candidate as enhancing light absorption material to increase power conversion efficiency(PCE).

In this paper, CdS was synthesized by hydrothermal process and used with a mixture of titanium dioxide anatase and rutile (TiO2(A+R)) to build the photoanode, whereas the counter electrode was made of nanocomposites of conductive polymer polyaniline (PANI) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) deposited on a fluorine-doped tin oxide substrate. Two morphologies of CdS have been obtained by using hydrothermal process: branched nanorods (CdSBR) and straight nanorods (CdSNR). The present work indicates that controlling the morphology of CdS is crucial to enhance the efficiency of DSSCs device. Indeed, the higher power conversion energy of 1.71% was achieved for a cell CdSBR-TiO2(A+R)/PANI-MWCNTs under 100 mW/cm(2), whereas the power conversion energy of 0.97 and 0.83% for CdSNR-TiO2(A+R)/PANI-MWCNTs and TiO2(A+R)/PANI-MWCNTs, respectively.

The significance and variety of these applications have attracted great attention and spurred substantial progress in the synthesis and fundamental understanding of TiO2-based nanomaterials, nanocomposites, and nanoderivatives. This review summarizes the recent advances in the design and preparation of TiO2-based nanomaterials, nanocomposites, and nanoderivatives obtained from titanium glycolate precursor. Utilizing different fabrication strategies, titanium glycolate precursor with controllable morphology and size has been successfully produced, and it can be directly transformed into crystalline TiO2 nanomaterials through diverse post-treatments, including calcination thermal-decomposition, and refluxing, hydrothermal, and microwave treatment-assisted hydrolysis. Furthermore, doped TiO2, TiO2-composites, and other derivatives could be simply achieved by adding additional chemicals during transformation. The favorable properties of the resulting TiO2-based materials are also discussed, which are relevant to energy and environmental applications in the areas of dye-sensitized solar cells, lithium ion batteries, photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, photocatalytic CO2 reduction, photocatalytic degradation, and adsorption removal of pollutants.

The as-synthesized Co-NMG combines the features of atomically dispersed active sites and interconnected mesoporous structure with high porosity, which makes these active sites fully exposed and accessible while facilitating the mass transport of reactants. As a result, the Co-NMG electrocatalysts with substantial active sites and desired porous architectures exhibit high electrocatalytic activity and long-term electrochemical stability. Electrochemical measurements and DFT calculations reveal that the catalytic sites toward the reduction of triiodide mainly derive from the abundant topological defects, nitrogen dopants, and especially the atomic Co-N-x-C moieties.

Nitrogen dopant concentration varied from 0 at.% to 1.57 at.%. The results confirmed that all N-doped samples exhibited pure anatase phase with an average diameter in the range of 7-12 nm. The pore volume and BET surface area increased with the amount of nitrogen in TiO2. XPS investigation displayed an N1s peak around 397 eV, which suggested N-Ti-O structure in the TiO2 matrix. Moreover, optical measurements showed that the optical absorption edge of N-doped TiO2 exhibited a significant shift from ultraviolet to visible light region in comparison with pure TiO2.

For the electrical characterization of the samples the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy technique (EIS) has been used in the frequency range 1 MHz divided by 10 mHz. For both electrolytes three frequency domains have been singled out. At large frequencies a hopping mechanism ensures the relative high conductivity of ionic liquids. A good fit of the conductivity data with respect to temperature with a Vogel-Tamman-Fulcher (VTF) equation has been done. The interesting result is that although C12 has a higher viscosity than C6 and thus a smaller conductivity was expected the observed conductivity is actually larger, this fact being attributed to the smectic A liquid crystal order of C12. At medium frequencies and especially at low frequencies the buildup of double layers by the electrodes is well observed. Assuming that in this region (10 Hz divided by 10 mHz) the cell is equivalent to an electric circuit formed by the parallel of a resistance, R-0, and a capacitance, C-0, the simple Debye relaxation model, characterized by one relaxation time, has been modified taking into account the adsorption phenomenon in the Langmuir approximation.

The reduced form of P1 interacts with both T-3(-) (I-3(-)) and T-2(-) center dot (I-2(-)center dot) through reductive cleavage of the S-S (I-I) bond, whereas T-2 (I-2) interactions involving single-electron transfer occur without S-S (I-I) bond breakage. Therefore, regeneration with a thiolate-disulfide redox couple (as well as with iodide-triiodide) proceeds by three different mechanisms: by interaction with T-3(-) (I-3(-)) via the transient intermediate complex T-2(-)center dot center dot center dot P1 center dot center dot center dot T- (I-2(-)center dot center dot center dot P1 center dot center dot center dot I-) to give T-2(-) center dot (I-2(-) center dot) and T- (I-); by interaction with T-2 (I-2 via PI center dot center dot center dot T-2(-) (P1 center dot center dot center dot I-2(-)) to give T-2(-) center dot (I-2(-)center dot); or by interaction with T-2(-)center dot (I-2(-)center dot) via T-center dot center dot center dot P1 center dot center dot center dot T- (I-center dot center dot center dot P1 center dot center dot center dot I-) to give two T- (I-) moieties. The P1-T2(-)center dot complexes have far fewer configurations, and the T-2(-) center dot species are much farther away from the semiconductor surface than are the I-2(-) center dot species in P1-I-2(-) center dot.

One of the most important components in DSSCs is the TiO2 layer, which serves as an active inorganic semiconductor oxide for photoelectron activity. Herein, TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized via a sol-gel process using titanium tetra-n-butoxide, ethanol, hydrochloric acid, and deionized water at molar ratios of 0.4:0.83:1:1.39 upon sol preparation, followed by hydrothermal processes at three different temperatures (i.e., 100 degrees C, 120 degrees C, and 150 degrees C); ambient drying; and multi-step calcination. For comparison, TiO2 aerogel nanoparticles were also prepared via supercritical extraction followed by multi-step calcination. The samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface-area measurements, UV-Vis spectroscopy in the diffuse-reflectance-) mode, and scanning electron microscopy.

The cell architecture explored in this report is similar to that of a dye-sensitized solar cell but with delivery of electrons to a mesoporous layer of TiO2 by natural pigment-protein complexes rather than an artificial dye. Rba. sphaeroides RCs were bound to the deposited TiO2 via an engineered extramembrane peptide tag. Using TMPD (N,N,N,N-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine) as an electrolyte, these biohybrid photoactive electrodes produced an output that was the net product of cathodic and anodic photocurrents. To explain the observed photocurrents, a kinetic model is proposed that includes (1) an anodic current attributed to injection of electrons from the triplet state of the RC primary electron donor (P-T) to the TiO2 conduction band, (2) a cathodic current attributed to reduction of the photooxidized RC primary electron donor (P+) by surface states of the TiO2 and (3) transient cathodic and anodic current spikes due to oxidation/reduction of TMPD/TMPD+ at the conductive glass (FTO) substrate. This model explains the origin of the photocurrent spikes that appear in this system after turning illumination on or off, the reason for the appearance of net positive or negative stable photocurrents depending on experimental conditions, and the overall efficiency of the constructed cell.

The main objective of this study was to analyze the factors involved in the performance of a DSSC. For this purpose, the experimental design considered the variation in the anthocyanin concentration, impregnation time and extract type through the Taguchi methodology with an orthogonal array L-4(2(3)) methodology that contributed to reduce cost, time and to obtain reliable statistical results. Then, the effect of these factors was identified by ANOVA, determining the incidence on the efficiency of the DSSC. As a result of the experimental program, the effect on efficiency by anthocyanin concentration was 43.90%, impregnation time 4.55% and extract type 51.22%.

For this reason this research intend to solve the continuity equation for the iodide, tri-iodide and the electron transport using FDM method to investigate the effect electrolyte properties on the performance of DSSCs.

The analytic results from TEM, EDX, XPS, and Raman revealed that the rGO decorated with 100 nm Pt NPs was successfully formed by the gamma-ray irradiation-induced reduction of both the GO and Pt precursor in aqueous IPA solution. Based on the results of the DSSCs performance test, the energy conversion efficiency of the DSSCs with the L-Pt/rGO-based CE outperformed that with the rGO-based one due to the lower sheet resistance, and even was comparable to that of the Pt-based CE.

The CeO2:Gd nanoparticle-based DSSC showed a photoconversion efficiency of 8.03% with an improvement of 45% compared to that of the conventional TiO2 nanoparticle-based DSSC due to the increased diffuse reflectance of visible light. The TiO2/CeO2:Gd photoanode had higher charge transfer resistance than conventional TiO2 nanoparticlebased photoanode.

The efficient synthetic protocols on phase structure evolution and dynamic decomposition behavior enable the production of the Fe1-xS/Fe3C-NCNT hybrid with advanced structural and electronic properties, in which the Fe vacancy contained Fe1-xS showed the 3d metallic state electrons and an electroactive Fe in +2/+3 valence, and the electronic structure of the CNT was effectively modulated by the incorporated Fe3C and N, with the work function decreased from 4.85 to 4.63 eV.

Although an enhancement of PCE because of the incorporation of plasmonic nanostructures of different sizes, either bare or coated, has been demonstrated, the fundamental mechanisms associated to such enhancement are still unclear. Besides, the photocurrent enhancement of plasmonic DSSCs is frequently associated to the strong surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption of metal nanoparticles. In this work, through oxygen K-edge soft X-ray absorption and emission spectroscopies of plasmonic electrodes and electrodynamical characterization of the fabricated cells, we demonstrate a band gap narrowing and photocharging effect on the plasmonic electrodes that definitely contribute to the PCE enhancement in plasmonic DSSCs. The incorporation of bare metal nanoparticles in active metal oxide semiconductor electrodes such as TiO2 in optimum concentration causes an upward shift of its valence band edge, reducing its effective band gap energy and enhancing the short-circuit current of DSSCs. On the other hand, small perturbation-based stepped light-induced transient measurements of photovoltage and photocurrent of the operating DSSCs revealed an upward shift of quasi-Fermi level of photoelectrodes because of the photocharging effect induced by the incorporated metal nanoparticles. The upward shift of the quasi-Fermi level causes an increase in open-circuit voltage (V-OC), nullifying the effect of band gap reduction. The short-circuit photocurrent enhancement was controlled by the band gap narrowing, screening the SPR contribution. The results presented in this work not only clarify the contribution of SPR absorption in plasmonic DSSCs, but also highlight the importance of considering the corrections in the effective base voltage because of the quasi-Fermi level band shift during the estimation of the transport and recombination parameters of an assembled DSSC.",,,,"Rodil, Sandra/Q-3248-2018; Yang, Wanli/D-7183-2011; Pal, Umapada/C-5128-2018","Rodil, Sandra/0000-0002-0275-4418; Yang, Wanli/0000-0003-0666-8063; Pal, Umapada/0000-0002-5665-106X; Olalde Velasco, Paul/0000-0003-0882-0778",,,,,,,,,,,,1944-8244,1944-8252,,,,19-Sep,2018,10,37,,,,,31374,31383,,10.1021/acsami.8b10063,,,,,,,,WOS:000445439900047,30129358,,,,

The kinetics of these processes have been difficult to understand because transient absorbance (TA) experiments typically show nearly complete charge recombination on the submillisecond time scale; in contrast, electrochemical measurements such as open circuit photovoltage decay suggest a charge recombination time scale that is 2-3 orders of magnitude longer. Here we explore these processes with dye-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 and TiO2/Ta2O5 core-shell photoanodes in aqueous electrolytes using TA spectroscopy, intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS), and photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS). The fast recombination rates measured by TA result from strong laser excitation that leads to high electron occupancy in TiO2, whereas IMVS modulates the concentration of charge-separated states near solar irradiance levels. The recombination processes measured by electrochemical methods such as IMVS, PEIS, and transient photovoltage are the discharging of injected electrons in TiO2, as evidenced by the close agreement between the nearly first-order recombination rates probed by IMVS and the RC time constants derived from PEIS data. However, IMVS measurements at variable probe light intensity reveal that the reaction orders for the recombination of injected electrons with oxidized sensitizer molecules are far from unity.

A pristine eC surface overlaid with KC1 is prepared in vacuum, protected from contamination in air, and exposed to an ultrapure aqueous solution of Co(phen)(3)(2+) by the dissolution of the protective KC1 layer. We employ SECM-based nanogap voltammetry to quantitatively demonstrate that Co(phen)(3)(2+) is adsorbed on the pristine eC surface to electrostatically self-inhibit outer-sphere ET of nonadsorbed Co(phen)(3)(3+) and Co(phen)(3)(2+). Strong electrostatic repulsion among Co(phen)(3)(2+) adsorbates is also demonstrated by SECM-based nanogap voltammetry and cyclic voltammetry. Quantitatively, self-inhibitory ET is characterized by a linear decrease in the standard rate constant of Co(phen)(3)(2+) oxidation with a higher surface concentration of Co(phen)(3)(2+) at the formal potential. This unique relationship is consistent not with the Frumkin model of double layer effects, but with the Amatore model of partially blocked electrodes as extended for self-inhibitory ET. Significantly, the complicated coupling of electron transfer and surface adsorption is resolved by combining nanoscale and macroscale voltammetric methods.",,,,"Chen, Ran/L-4476-2019","Chen, Ran/0000-0002-6808-4381; Morteza Najarian, Amin/0000-0002-0455-0451; Amemiya, Shigeru/0000-0001-7357-4505",,,,,,,,,,,,0003-2700,1520-6882,,,,18-Sep,2018,90,18,,,,,11115,11123,,10.1021/acs.analchem.8b03023,,,,,,,,WOS:000445322800065,30118206,,,,

Compared with traditional solar cells with opaque counter electrodes where the sunlight can only pass from the photoanode, bifacial solar cells, which are composed of photoanode, electrolyte, transparent counter electrode, hole transport layer can realize the purpose that sunlight can pass through the photoanode and the transparent counter electrode (CE) at the same time, which can reduce the loss of sunlight and greatly broad the light utilization of device to achieve improved opto-electronic performance. In the entire electrochemical cycle, the transparent counter electrode is regarded as reducing agent in reducing the oxidation state I-3(-) in the electrolyte to the reduced state I- so the electrocatalytic activity, chemical stability, electrical conductivity of the transparent counter electrode directly influences the rear side photo-to-electricity efficiency of device and the preparation of transparent counter electrodes is significantly important for the device. Therefore, it is necessary to study the effect of the counter electrode on the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the bifacial solar cells. In view of the problems of low transmittance, high cost, and low light utilization of traditional CE, the transparent CE of bifacial solar cells with high power conversion efficiency and low cost are preferred. The transparent CE of bifacial DSSCs, QDSCs and PSCs are comprehensively discussed in this paper. The influence of materials choosing and interfacial modification methods of transparent counter electrode on the photovoltaic performances of bifacial devices are analyzed. The transparent counter electrodes materials mainly include metals and alloys, sulfides, selenides, conductive polymers, and so on. In conclusion, bifacial solar cells mainly have the following problems: high reflectivity of metal electrodes, corrosion of the sulfide on the electrodes and the stability of the conductive polymers.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, corroborated by Auger electron spectroscopy, indicated that such treatments yield undetectable surface coverages. However, steady-state photo-electrochemical responses consistently showed that sub-bandgap photoresponses were commensurate with light absorption by the adsorbed dye. The photoresponse characteristics were clearly insensitive to the identity and amount of intended redox mediators dissolved in solution at low light intensities. Instead, the data suggest electrochemically active surface states related to the cathodic degradation of GaP can accept electrons from photoexcited physisorbed dye. Measurements at high illumination intensities showed sensitivity toward redox mediators in solution, indicating that the conventional mode of dye regeneration by redox species in solution is possible with p-GaP.

Herein, we report a detailed investigation on the relationship between the portions of COOH and COO- dye forms and the photophysical and solar cell properties of an organic dipolar sensitizer, BTZA-II, bearing triphenylamine electron-donating and benzothiazole electron-withdrawing moieties. The photophysics has been studied by stationary and timeresolved fluorescence spectroscopy in apolar and polar solvents with a dye concentration ranging from 5 x 10(-7) to 5 x 10(-5) M, also upon addition of small amounts of an external acid or base to change the solvent acidity, allowing us to distinguish the contribution and lifetime of the neutral and anionic forms. The fluorescence of BTZA-II in apolar toluene originates from the neutral form, which has a lifetime of 1.9 ns. Addition of a strong base (1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, DBU) shifts the equilibrium toward the less fluorescent anionic COO- form with a lifetime of 1.1 ns. The situation is different in the polar acetonitrile, where the fluorescence of the anionic form dominates (with a lifetime of 2.0 ns). Adding small amounts of acetic acid (AcOH) protonates the COO- form of the BTZA-II dye and reveals significant quenching of the fluorescence because of the increased contribution of the neutral species with a lifetime of 0.4-0.5 ns. This quenching of the neutral species in acetonitrile has been also observed in concentrated solutions and is due to excited-state proton transfer. By contrast, the photophysics of a dye Btz-NPh2, similar to BTZA-II but without the cyanoacrylic acid group, is not affected upon adding acetic acid (H-donor) or DBU base (H-acceptor), which rules out the Bronsted-base role of the benzothiazole scaffold in the aforementioned observations. Finally, dyesensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with a solid-state electrolyte were prepared from toluene and toluene + acid solutions. A significant increase in the solar cell efficiency, eta, by 58% (eta reaching a value of 4.9%) has been achieved after addition of a small, appropriate amount of acetic acid into the initial BTZA-II dye solution.",,,,"Hrobarik, Peter/B-4122-2011","Hrobarik, Peter/0000-0002-6444-8555",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-7447,,,,,6-Sep,2018,122,35,,,,,20122,20134,,10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b05686,,,,,,,,WOS:000444355400009,,,,,

The photovoltaic technologies which directly utilize the abundant and sustainable solar energy are critical. Among various photovoltaic devices (solar cells), dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have gained increasing attention due to their high efficiency and easy fabrication process in the past decade. The cathode is a critical part in DSSCs while the benchmark Pt cathode suffers from high cost and scarcity. Thus, the development of alternative Pt-free cathodes has attracted significant attention with the aim to heighten the cost competitiveness of DSSCs. Among various cathodes, metal oxides are of growing interest due to their superior activity, robust stability, and low cost. Simple oxides such as WO3 and SnO2 are used as cathodes for DSSCs. Considering the fixed atomic environment in simple oxides, complex oxides are more attractive as cathodes because of their more flexible physical and chemical properties. This review attempts to present the rational design of simple/complex metal oxide-based cathodes in DSSCs and then to provide useful guidance for the future design of Pt-free cathodes.

Specifically, the sum of charge-transfer resistances at TiO2-TiO2 and Pt-electrolyte junctions, the Warburg component, and contact and FTO sheet resistances was in good agreement with the series resistance deduced from the fitting of measured J-V curves to an imperfect diode with parasitic resistances.

On the other hand, its commercialization has been limited by the low power generation efficiency and durability. Few studies have examined the power generation performance of a full scale DSSC module applied to actual buildings. In this study, a long-term performance test was conducted on vertical and inclined DSSC BIPV (Building Integrated Photovoltaic) windows applied to a full-scale mock-up facility to verify the power performance and power characteristics of transparent DSSC BIPV glazing under actual conditions over a 2 year period. The DSSC module was fabricated by the serial connection of nine 2.26Wp transparent DSSC sub-modules. The multi-layered DSSC BIPV glazing, which was composed of a ""DSSC module (9mm)"" + ""air space (12 mm)"" + ""clear glass (5mm)"" was joined to the curtain wall frame of the test cell facility. The unit size of the DSSC BIPV glazing was 0.975 m (W) x 0.965 m (H) and its maximum capacity was 20.34Wp. The size of the test cell facility was 3 m (W) x 3 m (H) x 9 m (D). The building is a container type insulated with 100 mm urethane foam. Four and two DSSC BIPV windows were installed on the vertical south wall and on the 30 degrees sloped roof, respectively. Through the monitoring system, the power performance data of each DSSC BIPV windows and meteorological data were analyzed over a two year period (from 1st Jan. 2015 to 31st Dec 2016). The 2 year data showed that the average daily power yield for each month of the vertical DSSC BIPV window ranged from 1.75 to 3.93 kWh/kWp day (average 2.53 kWh/kWp day), whereas that of the 30 degrees sloped DSSC BIPV window ranged from 2.16 to 5.34 kWh/kWp day (average 3.60 kWh/kWp day). The operating power efficiency of the vertical DSSC BIPV window ranged from 2.65 to 4.14% with an average of 3.40%, whereas that of the sloped DSSC BIPV window was in the range of 2.64-3.63% with a mean of 3.01%. The power generation efficiency of the vertical plane BIPV window was higher than the sloped BIPV window. In contrast to the average daily power yield, the power efficiency of the vertical window was higher than that of the sloped window, which may be due to the higher efficiency of the DSSCs under overcast conditions. This is consistent with the power performance of the DSSC BIPV windows according to the sky conditions, which showed an increase in power efficiency with increasing cloud cover or decreasing solar intensity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0306-2619,1872-9118,,,,1-Sep,2018,225,,,,,,1013,1021,,10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.04.086,,,,,,,,WOS:000438181000078,,,,,

Successful C-H bond functionalization mainly resorts to homogeneous transition-metal catalysis, albeit sometimes suffering from poor catalyst reusability, nontrivial separation, and severe biotoxicity. TiO2 photocatalysis displays multifaceted advantages, such as strong oxidizing ability, high chemical stability and photostability, excellent reusability, and low biotoxicity. The chemical reactions started and delivered by TiO2 photocatalysts are well known to be widely used in photocatalytic water-splitting, organic pollutant degradation, and dye-sensitized solar cells. Recently, TiO2 photocatalysis has been demonstrated to possess the unanticipated ability to trigger the transformation of inert C-H bonds for C-C, C-N, C-O, and C-X bond formation under ultraviolet light, sunlight, and even visible-light irradiation at room temperature. A few important organic products, traditionally synthesized in harsh reaction conditions and with specially functionalized group substrates, are continuously reported to be realized by TiO2 photocatalysis with simple starting materials under very mild conditions. This prominent advantage-the capability of utilizing cheap and readily available compounds for highly selective synthesis without prefunctionalized reactants such as organic halides, boronates, silanes, etc.-is attributed to the overwhelmingly powerful photo-induced hole reactivity of TiO2 photocatalysis, which does not require an elevated reaction temperature as in conventional transition-metal catalysis. Such a reaction mechanism, under typically mild conditions, is apparently different from traditional transition-metal catalysis and beyond our insights into the driving forces that transform the C-H bond for C-C bond coupling reactions. This review gives a summary of the recent progress of TiO2 photocatalytic C-H bond activation for C-C coupling reactions and discusses some model examples, especially under visible-light irradiation.",,,,,"Lu, Chichong/0000-0002-7065-6123",,,,,,,,,,,,2073-4344,,,,,SEP,2018,8,9,,,,,,,355,10.3390/catal8090355,,,,,,,,WOS:000448331700015,,,,,

Herein, with the introduction of cyanoacetic acid into the rhodanine segment, two novel indoline sensitizers, CS-22 and CS-24, based on D-pi-A construction are designed and synthesized. With this modification, the carboxyl group is conjugated with the whole molecule, leading to sharp enhance of light-harvesting capability of the dye and more important, quite smooth electron injection process. Moreover, the introduced long alkyl chain can also prevent the n-aggregation on TiO2 surface and restrain the charge recombination effectively. Accordingly, using the modified acceptor, the photovoltaic performance is significantly improved: an extremly high PCE of 8.48% is obtained by CS-22 sensitized DSSC, which is the highest value among rhodanine dyes without any co-adsorbent.

Simulations suggest that an enhanced photocurrent occurs in the presence of lithium cations, which is attributed to the photochemical generation of an excited-state dye lithium adduct. In this adduct, a lithium cation is interacting with the carbonyl moieties of the dcbH ligands, which results in a bathochromic shift of the [Ru(dmb)(2)(dcbH)](2+) metal-to-ligand charge-transfer spectral band. This shift in absorption can be canceled by introducing a hypothetical dipolar electric field of 7.3 MV/cm, in good agreement with experimentally reported values for Stark effects observed under solar excitation of TiO2 functionalized with these types of sensitizer molecules.

An injection method is first used to make CNC aerogel fibers by crosslinking with gelatin (GE). The gelation of the injectable fibers can be conducted by manipulating interactions between CNCs and GE to preserve the chiral nematic order. The gCNC fibers are then used as templates to make porous TiO2/gCNC aerogel composites with structural organization imparted by the chiral arrangement and hierarchical organization of the gCNC fibers. The uniqueness of this templating concept lies in its ability to truly replicate spindle-shaped features of CNCs in freestanding TiO2 nanofibrillar aerogels. The affinity of functional groups of gelatin on the CNC aerogels with metal-based precursors causes the attachment of TiO2 nanoparticles around cellulose nanorods to form core-shell-like aerogel composites. The uniform integration of these components leads to the retention of TiO2 aerogel fibers after thermal removal of the gCNC template. To further demonstrate the use of gCNC fibers for templating, they are used to fabricate polypyrrole composites that retain the chiral structure of the aerogel. These new templated fibers are promising materials for supercapacitor electrodes, sensors, catalysts, and dye-sensitized solar cells.

In our previous works, a series of edge-functionalized GnPs were thoroughly studied and successfully utilized as CEs in DSSCs, with the aim of finding possible alternatives to the noble and expensive Pt metal as CE. However, in each study, the GnP-CEs were not only fabricated with different dyes and electrolytes but were also evaluated on different occasions, and thus, it was difficult to identify which type of edge-functionalized GnPs was the best. Herein, DSSCs with different edge-functionalized GnP-CEs were fabricated under the same environmental conditions, photovoltaic performances were then evaluated employing both I-/I-3(-) and Co(bpy)(3)(2+/3+) (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine) redox couples with three different sensitizers to assess the electrocatalytic activity of the different GnP-CEs. Photovoltaic performances of edge-halogenated GnP-CEs with N719 dye employing the I-/I-3(-) redox couple were lower than those of the metalloid-doped GnP-CEs and were even inferior to Pt-CE, which was consistent with the R-ct values. Conversely, among the metalloid-doped GnP-CEs, SbGnP-CE exhibited a higher R-ct value and lower power conversion efficiency (PCE) value of 8.70% and 6.60% with N719 and SGT-130 dyes, respectively.

Among the challenges to be embedded lately with agricultural activities is to explore clean and renewable energy resources. Electrical energy generation via solar technology, or known also as photovoltaic (PV) technology, has been the most economical viable green resource, especially in tropical-based countries. The most notable problem revealed by conventional PV in greenhouses, however, is due to the antagonistic factor lying in both photovoltaic roofs and plants. As such, the divergence subsequently decreases the growth and productivity of the cultivated crops. The Dye Sensitized Solar Cell (DSSC) is thus of great importance to human as it possesses several attractive features. For instance, the fabrication of DSSC is cheap. It is also flexible, transparent, and sensitive to low light levels. Besides its easiness to be used in larger applications, makes DSSC an ideal candidate that could function greatly as energy buildings. This review article aims to explore the DSSC technology's potential and its effectiveness as a shading greenhouse. Further, in-depth understanding on the uniqueness and advantages of this technology is thoroughly assessed. In comparison to conventional PV, the DSSC technology especially on solar radiation manipulation through the optimum choice of photosensitizer is well described.

The enhancement in electron transport led to increases in both short circuit current and open circuit voltage, resulting in a slight (1.1% to 1.3%) improvement in photovoltaic conversion efficiency compared to undoped TiO2. Such control of electron transport within the photoelectrode is attributed to improvements in electron injection through ICT transitions.",,,,,"Ochiai, Tsuyoshi/0000-0003-2061-9372; NAGATA, Morio/0000-0001-6949-713X",,,,,,,,,,,,2073-4344,,,,,SEP,2018,8,9,,,,,,,367,10.3390/catal8090367,,,,,,,,WOS:000448331700027,,,,,

Energy harvesting powered wireless sensors enable existing and new structures to comply with Industry 4.0 and become smart buildings. Due to the size constraints of wireless sensor systems and the inherently low-power levels generated by energy harvesting sources, available power is limited and therefore the efficiency of power conversion and energy management circuitry connected between the source and output load has a significant impact on output power delivery. Most research to date focuses on improving the efficiency of individual components of such systems, without considering the impact of one stage on the others. In this paper, the potential of varying energy harvesting source configuration in combination with power converter operation to improve overall power delivery is investigated, where it is shown that by connecting sections of a DSSC in series rather than as a single cell, higher power conversion efficiency and therefore power delivery is achieved. Limitations to varying cell configurations and low-power DC-DC topologies are illustrated in order to demonstrate the scope of solutions available for small-sized, low-power, energy harvesting sources. It is shown that 8% improvement in overall power delivery is achieved for series vs. single cell connections within a fixed module area. This will translate into increased wireless sensor functionality and range, thereby furthering the development of the Industrial Internet of Things in buildings and homes. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Reduced electron relaxation lifetime (tau e) of 1.83 ms (Lil + 7) and 1.04 (Lil + 8) provides efficient charge injection and thus reducing recombination process in the device. The performance of DSSC fabricated using unsymmetrical conjugated dendrimers with iodide electrolyte shows higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) than standard Lil based device. Two fold increments are achieved in PCE with first generation unsymmetrical dendrimers compared to their zeroth counterpart. The first generation unsymmetrical dendrimer 8 shows better PCE of 9.037% than all other synthesized dendrimers in the newly fabricated DSSC. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Because of the large transient dipole moment characterizing this type of dye upon photoexcitation, these molecules are intrinsically subjected to significant lateral electronic interactions once adsorbed on a solid surface, which can greatly affect the efficiency of the electron injection in DSSCs. Here, we investigated the detailed intermolecular interactions upon photoexcitation of D-pi-A diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based dye molecules, denoted (E)-3-(5-(4-(4-(5-(4-(bis(2',4'-dibutoxy-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)amino)phenyl)thiophen-2-yl)-2,5-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-3,6-dioxo-2,3,5,6-tetrahydropyrrolo [3,4-c] pyrrol-1-yl) phenyl)furan-2-yl)-2-cyanoacrylic acid (DPP_A) and commercially available under the name ""Dyenamo Blue"", using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. A comparison of the excited-state properties of the molecule with those of a similar dye lacking the triarylamine donor moiety (DPP_R) revealed the critical role played by the donor in determining the mechanisms of intermolecular interactions. The results showed that the intermolecular interactions between DPP_A molecules in solution caused partial delocalization of excitons in a process involving the participation of the triarylamine moiety. Lateral charge transfer (CT) between DPP_A molecules adsorbed on the redox-inactive surface of Al2O3 was observed upon photoexcitation and yielded CT excitons between neighboring dyes. Furthermore, on the basis of the experimental evidence obtained from the pump fluence-dependent transient absorption and excitation spectra, the DPP_R molecules adsorbed on the Al2O3 film exhibited intermolecular pi-pi interactions, inducing the formation of excimer-like excited states.

The self-assembly of Pt nanoparticles on the ST is based on electrostatic interaction between the Pt cations and negatively charged ST surface.

The Pt dip-coated ST shows a photovoltaic efficiency of 5.07%, which is higher than those of Pt spin-coated ST (4.88%) and Pt spincoated on the substrate without ST (4.59%). An increase in the Pt concentration leads to further improvement in the efficiency up to 5.51%, which is a moderate value for solid electrolyte devices.

It is crucial to develop an in situ technology that controls the rate of dye desorption. Meanwhile, controlling the coverage of dye-sensitized films is still a major challenge. The work presented in this paper applies a simple and effective method to study the in situ mass change responses on dye-sensitized TiO2 films over different potential ranges. The result shows that dye molecule desorption is accompanied by the adsorption of ions in solution. Due to this parasitic adsorption process, the frequency responses in the electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) test cannot be completely attributable to dye molecule desorption. We established a new model to eliminate the impact of this parasitic adsorption process. The kinetics of in situ desorption of dye molecules on sensitized TiO2 nanoparticles in a high-concentration solution was studied. We found that the in situ desorption of dye could be described by pseudo-first-order kinetics. The results suggest that the dye in situ desorption rate is dependent on the bias voltage, and the coverage of dye on the surface of TiO2 films can be further controlled.

To increase device efficiency requires optimized dye injection and regeneration, most likely from multiple dyes while replacement of liquid electrolytes requires solid charge transporters (most likely hole transport materials - HTMs). While theoretical and experimental work have both been widely applied to different aspects of DSC research, these approaches are most effective when working in tandem. In this context, this perspective paper considers the key parameters which influence electron transfer processes in DSC devices using one or more dye molecules and how modelling and experimental approaches can work together to optimize electron injection and dye regeneration.

PPy films synthesized in DS or IL have shown larger and irregular granules as compared to PPy films prepared in the mixture of DS and IL. This result is related to the preferential dissolution of pyrrole monomers in micelle templates formed by the IL and a co-assembly of IL and dodecyl-sulfate (DS), thereby decreasing the granule size and affecting the structural arrangement of the polymer chain. The template behavior of the IL in combination with DS promotes the selective formation of polaron and bipolaron states in the PPy films.

The surface property is a key part of photocatalysis. In this work, the enhanced photocatalytic behavior of the layered ReS2 with optical polarization along the Re-4 nano-diamond-chain (DC) direction (b axis) has been demonstrated. The unpolarized photoconductivity (PC) response of ReS2 with an applied bias along the b axis is approximately 1 order higher than that of the applied bias perpendicular to the b axis. The polarization-dependent PC spectra of E parallel to b also reveal a higher photoresponsivity with respect to those measured along the E perpendicular to b polarization for the layered ReS2. This result indicates that stronger polarization dipoles as well as a larger amount of photogenerated carriers and surface states can contribute to the C-plane ReS2 under the illumination of E parallel to b polarized photons. With the special axial effect, the layered ReS2 2D photocatalyst shows much faster degradation rates of 5.6 and 12.3 than the other transition-metal dichalcogenides of TaS2 and MoS2 for the degradation of methylene blue (MNB) solution. For the polarization-dependent photodegradation test, the degradation rate of illuminated E parallel to b polarized photons is also approximately 12 times faster than that of the illuminated E perpendicular to b polarized light in a 25 mu M MNB solution. The enhanced photocatalytic behavior of ReS2 along the DC also shows a peak photoreponse of similar to 25 mu V detected in the polarized photovoltaic spectrum of the 0.5 MNB dye-sensitized solar cell positioned at similar to 1.99 eV.

Unique porous microstructures (lamellar or interconnected pore structures) were obtained by controlling the concentrations of slurry and binder. The freeze-casted photoelectrodes exhibited stronger light scattering effects than conventionally screen-printed mesoporous photoelectrode. This is attributed to a great number of scattering sites (interconnected pores with the size range of 50500 nm), which are uniformly distributed throughout the entire freeze-casted photoelectrodes, resulting in an enhancement of the light pathway. As a result, despite a lower dye adsorption and less kinetically efficient charge transport, DSSCs based on freeze-casted photoelectrodes showed significant conversion efficiencies (3.64%) compared with those of DSSCs based on conventionally screen-printed photoelectrodes (2.57%).

Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis for metal-free organic sensitizer has been shown that the electron transfer occurs from an electron donor (D) to electron acceptor (A) units. Bond length change (BLA) values demonstrate a good relationship with ascertained estimation of second-order hyperpolarizability. The singlet-triplet investigation demonstrates that the sensitizer having a required estimation of the singlet-triplet energy gap, and it is a good contender for the DSSCs application. Frontier molecular orbital (FMO) analysis showed that both the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) have electron localization support the electron transfer characters.

However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) was only 1.48%, resulting from poor pole filling of the hole conductor, 2,2',7,7'-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9'-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD). To modify the interface between RuS and spiro-OMeTAD, additional 4,4'-bis((4-vinylbenzyloxy) methyl)-2,2'- bipyridine (BVP) ligand was employed to crosslink with RuS. The cross-linked dye (denoted as RuS-BVP) on TiO2 was more sustainable and the PCE rose to 2.12%. Besides, the outward bipyridine groups of RuS-BVP are capable of chelating cations. As lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide was applied to modify the interface between RuS-BVP and spiro-OMeTAD, the PCE increased to 2.55% and the interfacial resistance for charge transfer under sunlight dramatically decreased. As divalent cation compounds such as magnesium, calcium and barium acetylacetonate were individually adsorbed onto the RuS-BVP, the cell with magnesium acetylacetonate has the highest PCE of 2.82%, highest open circuit voltage and lowest interfacial resistance. The results suggest that the cations with higher charge density have stronger Coulomb's force to couple between RuS-BVP and spiro-OMeTAD. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The calculated results show that the dyes possessing both a small distribution of the HOMO on the anchoring group and a relatively strong Eight harvesting ability are the most promising candidates for use in dye-sensitized solar cells. Moreover, this work provides a deep understanding of the relationship between the electron recombination rate and electronic structure of dyes, and provides theoretical guidelines for the design of high performance sensitizer materials.",,,,"Zhang, Houyu/C-4837-2009","Zhang, Houyu/0000-0003-0360-6035",,,,,,,,,,,,1144-0546,1369-9261,,,,7-Aug,2018,42,15,,,,,12891,12899,,10.1039/c8nj02188k,,,,,,,,WOS:000445825800070,,,,,

The lack of understanding of charge transfer steps has hindered further development of DSSCs and many solar energy conversion devices/processes. In this study, we used in situ infrared spectroscopy to investigate electron transfer and photo-electric energy conversion processes at the interface, i.e., surface hydroxyls, adsorbed species, as well as the dynamics of photo-generated electrons in TiO2 and N-TiO2 in DSSCs. Nitrogen (N-) doping of TiO2 blocked linear OH, giving more hydrophobic surface characteristics than undoped TiO2. N-Doping further increased the electron-hole separation caused by solar light on the working electrode and the current density in the DSSC. In situ infrared (IR) studies revealed that N-doping facilitated the electron transfer from the N719 dye (di-tetrabutylammonium cis-bis(isothiocyanato) bis(2,2-bipyridyl-4,4-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II)) to the conduction band in TiO2, reducing the impedance in the DSSC.

A series of DFT calculations for new tPA-perylene-based dyes was conducted, starting from the systematic selection of DFT methods by reproducing the experimentally obtained properties of known perylene-based sensitizers. Accordingly, using the LC-omega PBE xc functional with 6-31+G(d) basis set for the time-dependent calculations of the excitation energies, a damping parameter of omega = 0.150 Bohr(-1) was found to be most appropriate for dyes having spatial orbital overlap value of 0.21 <= A(HL) <= 0.38, while omega = 0.175 Bohr(-1) is suitable for analogues with 0.43 <= A(HL) <= 0.57. Moreover, the mPWHandHPW91/6-31G(d) method gave high accuracy in GSOP calculations. The comparison between the properties of tPA-based donor groups has revealed that the semirigid tPA-based D4 unit is an effective donor group for perylene-based dye. Initial screening of the acceptor designs resulted in PLz4 dye with promising charge-transfer mechanism and highly favorable dye TiO2 interaction based on the calculated dipole moment of the dye and dye TiO2 complex. The attachment of the substituted-hydroacridine donor unit (D4) to PLz4 afforded a bathochromically shifted absorbance and improved molar absorptivity signifying its effective electron-donating ability.

For developing panchromatic and efficient porphyrin sensitizers, it has been demonstrated to be an effective approach to introduce an electron-withdrawing benzothiadiazole unit as an extra electron acceptor. In contrast, the structurally similar benzotriazole moiety remains relatively unknown in this respect. In this work, we have synthesized a novel porphyrin dye containing an extra electron acceptor of benzotriazole. Photophysical and electrochemical investigations revealed red-shifted absorption and a narrower band gap induced by the benzotriazole unit. Thus, a reasonable efficiency of 8.39% has been achieved with a J(sc) of 17.00 mA cm(-2) and a V-oc of 712 mV. On this basis, to investigate the effect of the dihedral angle between the benzotriazole and the adjacent phenylene ring, one or two methyl groups were attached to the ortho-positions of the phenylene ring. As a result, the enlarged torsion angles induce poor electronic coupling between the LUMO of the dyes and TiO2, resulting in lower efficiencies of 6.61% and 3.62%, respectively. With the purpose to further improve the efficiencies, coadsorption and cosensitization approaches were employed. And the efficiencies have been successfully elevated to 9.32%, 8.49% and 7.34%, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating an auxiliary benzotriazole acceptor into porphyrin dyes on achieving extended light-harvesting wavelength ranges and illustrate the importance of avoiding severe torsion within the acceptor part of the porphyrin dyes. In contrast to the commonly used cosensitizers with absorption peaks lying in the absorption valley between the Soret band and the Q bands of porphyrin dyes (500-600 nm), the utilization of an organic dye with broad absorption in this work has been demonstrated to be effective for improving the efficiencies despite the fact that its absorption peak at 450 nm largely overlaps with the Soret band of the porphyrin dyes. These results provide an alternative approach for developing cosensitizers for porphyrin dyes.",,,,"Tang, Weiqiang/P-3435-2018; ?, ??/B-3384-2009; Tang, Weiqiang/J-9007-2019","Tang, Weiqiang/0000-0002-7726-4130; Tang, Weiqiang/0000-0002-7726-4130",,,,,,,,,,,,0143-7208,1873-3743,,,,AUG,2018,155,,,,,,323,331,,10.1016/j.dyepig.2018.03.054,,,,,,,,WOS:000433650300042,,,,,

Nanoparticles and composites were characterized using Dynamic Light Scattering spectrophotometer, Raman spectrometer, X-ray diffractometer, field emission scanning electron microscope, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area analyzer and UV-Vis spectrophotometer. FESEM depicted that particles were spherical in shape and their size decreased due to addition of MWCNTs. This was attributed to the decrease in the crystallite size which in turn confirmed by XRD. UV-Vis absorption spectra showed the better absorbance for the visible range of light, as the content of MWCNT is increased. From the Tauc plot optical band gap was calculated and noted that it declined gradually with the content of MWCNTs. BET surface area increased drastically which was attributed to the formation of more number of pores in the nanocomposites as visualized from FESEM. UV-Vis spectra of dye desorbed from the photoanode revealed that the dye adsorption increased as a function of MWCNT wt%. I-V studies were carried out under the illumination of 100 mW/cm(2) simulated sunlight.

Quantum dynamics simulation in the framework of extended Huckel theory (EHT) was carried out to simulate the interface electron transfer process across the dye/TiO2 interface. The key parameters influence the short-circuit photocurrent density and open-circuit photovoltage were analyzed in detail. Our results suggest that the dyes with further extended pi-bridges has the gradually red-shifted absorption spectra and a persistent decrease of highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy. The extended pi-conjugated bridges deteriorate the performance mainly because of the increased charge recombination between injected electron and electrolyte arising from the unfavorable energy alignment between dye HOMO and redox potential of electrolyte, leading to inefficient dye regeneration process. This rationalizes the experimental observation that longer pi-bridge doesn't benefit the DSSCs performance. Further replacement of triphenylamine donor with carbazole or coumarin electron donor groups can shift down the HOMO level and avoid the inefficient dye regeneration issue whereas perseves other beneficial properties.

A ruthenium(II) trisbipyridine dye has been functionalised with this dual-anchor through a facile peptide coupling reaction. The photoelectrooxidation performance and stability of mesoporous TiO2 electrodes sensitised with this new dye have been systematically examined in solutions with pH 1-9 in the absence and presence of a sacrificial electron donor and/or buffering electrolyte following a specifically designed testing protocol, which involves comprehensive characterisation of the electrodes and electrolyte solutions by ICP-MS and UV-vis spectroscopy. When compared to the state-of-the-art phosphonate anchoring group, the silanetriolate-carboxylate combination enables approximately 4- and 8-fold enhancements in the rate of sulphite oxidation by the Ru(II) (bipyridine)(3)-sensitised TiO2 photoanodes under 1 sun irradiation after 2 and 24 hours of reaction, respectively. In the absence of a sacrificial electron donor, photoanodes based on carboxylate- and phosphonate-anchored dyes undergo continuous and rapid degradation under all conditions examined, leading to almost completely bleached electrodes within less than an hour of operation. Conversely, silanetriolate-carboxylate anchoring provides quasi-stable operation with typically less than 10% ruthenium loss from the electrode surface under the same conditions. The analysis undertaken here unambiguously attests to the significantly improved long-term performance of the dye-sensitised photoelectrodes provided by the cooperative anchoring system where silanetriolate provides high stability and carboxylate sustains efficient charge transfer. This furnishes a practical pathway towards the synthesis of photosensitisers capable of stable and efficient operation within photoelectrochemical devices in aqueous environments.",,,,"Simonov, Alexandr/B-6236-2015; Bonke, Shannon/Q-4469-2019","Simonov, Alexandr/0000-0003-3063-6539; Bonke, Shannon A/0000-0002-3285-4356",,,,,,,,,,,,2398-4902,,,,,1-Aug,2018,2,8,,,,,1707,1718,,10.1039/c8se00056e,,,,,,,,WOS:000445737800006,,,,,

The effect of the glancing angle on the structure, microstructure, and wetting properties of the films was investigated. The inclination of the substrate led to phase transformation of the deposited films from rutile to either rutile/anatase or anatase, depending on the working pressure. Extreme shadowing at 87 degrees results in a remarkable increase of the films' porosity and surface roughness. The mechanism of the glancing-angle-induced crystalline phase formation is thoroughly discussed based on the thermodynamic, kinetic, and geometrical aspects of the nucleation and is related with the microstructural changes. Both crystalline phase and microstructure significantly affect the wetting properties of the TiO2 films. Glancing-angle-deposited anatase TiO2 exhibits a high degree of porosity and roughness, a high rate of UV-induced wettability conversion, and a long-term highly hydrophilic nature in dark.

In this study, a coal-based porous carbon material with low cost and high performance was synthesized from three kinds of pulverized coal (collected from different regions of Xinjiang, China) through chemical activation followed by acid washing oxidation treatment. The prepared porous CBC material exhibited higher catalytic activity for the reduction of I-/I-3 (-) than Pt. The use of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) plus prepared porous CBC/CNTs composite materials as CEs for DSSCs led to a V (OC) of 0.62 V, a J (SC) of 21.92 mA cm (-2), an FF of 0.42, and a conversion efficiency of 5.75%, which is higher than those of CEs made of porous CBC, CNTs, or Pt. The improvement in the conversion efficiency could be attributed to the synergistic effect of the good catalytic activity of the prepared CBC materials and the good conductivity of CNTs. Moreover, the double-layer structure played an important role in improving the adhesion and electron transport capacity. Results provide a theoretical basis for the possible use of cheap CBCs as CEs for thin-film solar cells.

The binary electron-donor PC based dyes demonstrate better electronic properties and spectroscopic parameters. The calculated injection time of electrons from the excited state of dye to the conduction band of TiO2 is ideal for DSSC applications.

The most durable PEC device was tested for nearly one year in open circuit storage in the dark exhibiting a 26% reduction in the power conversion efficiency of the photovoltaic (PV) unit. As regards optical performance, it was found to gradually converge to a contrast ratio of about 1.5:1, having passed through a transitional period of about 80 days, that caused a decrease in the coloration depth, without affecting reversibility. This gradual loss of coloration depth was attributed to the reaction of photoelectrons with trliodide ions at the electrochromic WO3 film-electrolyte interface, that takes place prior to the formation of the colored LixWO3 tungsten bronze, and is enhanced while the liquid electrolyte wets the WO3 film. This phenomenon was also observed in ""redox"" type electrochromic devices, verifying the proposed loss mechanism. PEC devices were also exposed to insolation in short (SC) and open (OC) circuit conditions. The PEC device tested in SC operation for more than four months, exhibited a contrast ratio comparable to that of the devices kept in storage, although an 80% reduction in the power conversion efficiency of the PV element has been observed. On the other hand, OC operation of 3 months did not affect the performance of the PV element, but, resulted in irreversible coloration of the device tested, due to trapping of Li ions within the WO3 matrix. Having identified the causes for the observed adverse phenomena, remedies can be sought, such as thin film barrier layers to prevent the loss of photoelectrons to the electrolyte, modified electrolytes to enhance the PV element stability, avoidance of prolonged OC operation to prevent irreversible coloration. Indeed, a 60 nm thick ZnS barrier deposited on top of the WO3 film was found to effectively suppress the loss current reactions, doubling the contrast ratio of the stabilized PEC devices to 2.8:1, at the expense of coloration speed.",,,,,"Leftheriotis, George/0000-0002-2453-5785",,,,,,,,,,,,0927-0248,1879-3398,,,,1-Aug,2018,182,,,,,,281,293,,10.1016/j.solmat.2018.03.039,,,,,,,,WOS:000432769400032,,,,,
