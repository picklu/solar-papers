Such strategies can only be systematic and successful if they are derived from knowledge-based paradigms that relate individual aspects of the molecular structure for a given class of dyes to their photovoltaic properties. The optical and electrochemical properties of these dyes were investigated experimentally by UV-vis absorption and emission spectroscopy, as well as cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations on these dyes complement these experiments. Among other results, this concerted experimental and computational study revealed that the dialkylaminophenyl moiety in these dyes exhibits a large twist as a result of its ground-to-excited-state optical transition. In particular, a near-perpendicular (88.98 degrees) twist of the dimethylaminophenyl moiety relative to the pi-bridging unit that connects the three aryl rings in 2 was observed upon formation of its photo-excited-state structure. Moreover, it was discovered that 2 affords the highest V-OC and power-conversion efficiency (PCE) values among these dyes. The particularly high PCE for 2 was found to be due to this twisting of the phenyl ring, which blocks the pathway of electrons from TiO2 to the donor, and hence suppresses undesirable electron recombination at the dye center dot center dot center dot TiO2 interface. This diode-like effect minimizes undesirable electron recombination effects and represents an unprecedented structure property relationship that should be useful for the molecular engineering of larger chromophores in this class of dyes for DSSC applications.",,,,"Cole, Jacqueline/C-5991-2008",,,,,,,,,,,,,2574-0962,,,,,MAR,2018,1,3,,,,,1127,1139,,10.1021/acsaem.7b00244,,,,,,,,WOS:000458705200027,,,,,

In order to improve the photovoltaic properties of the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), we optimized the Nb doping level of the Nb-TiO2 BLs by controlling the Nb/Ti molar ratio (0, 5, 6, and 7) of the precursor solution for HUSPD. Compared to bare TiO2 BLs, the Nb-TiO2 BLs formed a cascading band structure using the positive shift of the conduction band minimum of the Nb-TiO2 positioned between fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) and TiO2. This results in the increase of the potential current and the suppression of the electron recombination. Hence, it led to the improvement of the electrical conductivity, due to the increased electron concentration by the Nb doping into TiO2. Therefore, the DSSC fabricated with the Nb-TiO(2 )BLs at a Nb/Ti molar ratio of 6 showed superior photoconversion efficiency (similar to 7.50 +/- 0.20%) as a result of the improved short-circuit current density. This is higher than those with the other Nb-TiO2 BLs and without BL. This improvement of the photovoltaic properties for the DSSCs can be attributed to the synergistic effects of uniform and compact BL relative to the prevention of the backward electron transport at the FTO/electrolyte interface, efficient electron transport at interfaces relative to a cascading band structure of FTO/Nb-TiO2/TiO2 multilayers and the facilitated electron transport at the BLs relative to the increased electrical conductivity of the optimized Nb-TiO2 BLs.

Stilbene (in dyes 2 and 5) and bis(styryl)benzene (in dyes 3 and 6) were used as pi-spacers. There is no pi-spacer in the dye 1 and 4. To elucidate the role of pi-spacers, optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties of the dyes were studied. Among C-acceptor dyes, dye 2 exhibits the highest light-to-electricity conversion efficiency of 4.45%, followed by dye 3 (4.16%). Similarly, among R-acceptor dyes, dye 5 is the best. These results indicate that stilbene is a better pi-spacer over bis(styryl) benzene. Although bis(styryl)benzene could extend the light absorption range (in dye adsorbed TiO2 film), its tendency to promote intermolecular pi-pi stacking is possibly the reason for its poor performance in DSSCs. Furthermore, the conjugation break in the R-acceptor moiety attached to the TiO2 surface limits the electron injection of R-acceptor dyes poorer than C-acceptor dyes. Density functional theory calculations were performed for the dye-(TiO2)(8) cluster, assuming a bidentate chelation of a carboxylic acid group with Ti4+ of TiO2 anatase.

The photovoltaic performance studies indicated that, the device fabricated using S-1 dye as co-sensitizer with 0.2 mM of NCSU-10 exhibited improved PCE of 9.55% with J(SC) of 22.85 mA cm(-2), V-OC of 0.672 V and FF of 62.2%, whereas the DSSC fabricated with dye NCSU-10 (0.2 mM) alone displayed PCE of 8.25% with J(SC) of 20.41 mA cm(-2), V-OC of 0.667 V and FF of 60.6%. Furthermore, electronic excitations simulated using time-dependent DFT, were in good agreement with the experimentally obtained results of the co-sensitizers, indicating that the exchange-correlation function and basis set utilized for predicting the spectra of the co-sensitizers are quite appropriate for the calculations. In conclusion, the results showed the potential of simple organic co-sensitizers in the development of efficient DSSCs. (C) 2017 Science Press. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The X-ray diffraction patterns for all samples exhibit highly crystalline NPs with a hexagonal wurtzite structure. The crystallite size and average relative intensity of the diffraction peaks of the samples increased with increasing Ga doping indicating improved crystallinity with an increase in the content of gallium in the ratio. Photoluminescence spectra also displayed an increase in exciton peak emission with increasing Ga doping levels and reached a maximum at a doping concentration of 2.0 mol% Ga, as well as a corresponding decrease in the deep level emission intensity, indicative that the best optical quality was obtained at the 2 mol% Ga level. It was observed a blue shift in the PL exciton emission peak position and the band edge emission of the reflectance spectra with increasing concentration of Ga in the sample. The optical band gap calculated from the reflectance data also increased with increasing Ga concentration.

DSSCs have a high but competitively challenged power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.9%. Plasmonic DSSCs is one approach with extreme enhancement of light absorption to increasing the PCE. The highest PCE of plasmonic DSSCs is still <11% however, due to secondary effects which are not yet well understood. In this study, we used a complex composite of plasmonic nanoparticles (PNPs) with extended characterization and wide ranging PNP loadings, combined with a systematic approach to obtain synergistic effects and a deeper understanding of the effects of plasmonic nanostructures on DSSC performance. The results showed two optimal loading amounts of PNPs with enhanced PCEs of 4.26 and 4.36% (from 3.54%), with enhancement effects obtained mainly from efficient charge injection and a balance of the negative and positive effects of the PNPs, respectively. An increase in the photoanode thickness from 5.5 to 9 mu m resulted in PCE enhancement from 4.39 to 4.58%, mainly via efficient charge injection. The PNPs had both positive and negative effects on key DSSC performance parameters: decreased photoanode surface area but with panchromatic enhancement of light absorbance; increased short circuit current up to a point followed by a decrease due to poor charge injection; increased open circuit voltage and fill factor; enhanced charge transfer resistance against charge recombination; improved electron lifetime and charge collection efficiency; lowered enhancement of cell performance in the near infra-red region; and induced abundantly generated electrons augmented charge recombination.

Towards this aim, the influence of film morphology, dye adsorption, electron recombination and sensitizer pH on the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the DSSCs is examined. Nanoparticle-based DSSCs with PCEs of up to 6.2% are developed and their main characteristics are examined. The efficiency of corresponding devices based on nanowire arrays (NW) is considerably lower (0.63%) by comparison, mainly due to low light harvesting ability of ZnO nanowire films. The dye loading of nanowire films is found to be approximately an order of magnitude lower than that of nanoparticle-based ones, regardless of their internal surface area.

A number of investigations including XRD, UV-Vis spectroscopy, EDS, and SEM were carried out to observe the variations due to adsorbed dye on TiO2 surface. XRD characterization revealed the effect of dye adsorption on specific surface area (SSA), crystallite size, and morphological index (MI). In this case, increasing SSA with decreasing particle size was found for both dye adsorbed and dye free DSSC photoanode samples. Also, the MI and SSA were found to be directly and inversely proportional to the crystallite size respectively. UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy showed that dye adsorption changes the light absorption, transmittance, and optical bandgap of the photoanode.

Herein, we have facilely prepared quince leaves derived porous carbon (QLPC) using fallen quince leaves (QLs) and it was used as a cost-effective CE for the fabrication of DSSCs. By means of alkali treatment and pyrolysis process (at different temperatures of 700, 800 and 900 degrees C), the QLs powder undergoes chemical activation and carbonization, which results in a honeycomb-like QLPC with abundant micro/mesopores and large surface area. Simple and straightforward coating of QLPC samples onto fluorine doped tin oxide glass substrates led to improved electrocatalytic activity and good tri-iodide reduction in DSSCs. When the DSSCs were illuminated under 1 sun condition (AM 1.5; 100 mW cm (2)), the device assembled with QLPC-based CE (prepared at 800 degrees C) showed a higher current density of similar to 14.99 mA/cm(2) and power conversion efficiency of similar to 5.52% among the other QLPC-based CEs, which are comparable with the platinum-based CE in DSSCs.

Meanwhile, the distinct red-shift of optical absorption and large amount of transferred charges are also obtained by structural tailoring of acceptor groups, whereas the large values of injection time may be harmful for the interfacial photoelectron injection. Therefore, comparing with donor modification, it should be more carefully to choose appropriate acceptor group with the balance of various energetic and kinetic factors for the rational design of high-efficient organic dyes.",,,,"Sun, Shujie/N-1421-2016","Sun, Shujie/0000-0001-7079-8378; Sun, Zhu-Zhu/0000-0003-3082-4222",,,,,,,,,,,,0379-6779,,,,,MAR,2018,237,,,,,,1,9,,10.1016/j.synthmet.2018.01.004,,,,,,,,WOS:000427336700001,,,,,

With this objective in mind, harnessing solar energy is particularly attractive due to ongoing improvements in silicon-, perovskite-, and organic-based solar cells. Of these, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) constitute a promising technology due to their relatively low cost, moderate conversion efficiency, and robust mechanical properties. An important breakthrough in the development of DSSCs is the use of polymer gel electrolytes. In this work, we employ amphiphilic thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) in the form of sulfonated block ionomer (SBI) homologs for this purpose. Since the midblock of each charged copolymer is hydrophilic, the resultant microphase-separated nanostructures consist of continuous ionic channels that facilitate electron diffusion. A unique characteristic of the SBI archetype studied here is that the morphology can be solvent-templated. We exploit this feature by introducing either hydrophilic or hydrophobic photosensitizers into the DSSCs. When the SBI exhibits a primarily lamellar morphology, a hydrophilic dye yields the highest efficiency (7.0%), whereas the opposite is observed when the nanostructure consists of a solvent-templated nonpolar matrix.

This is indicated by the absence of transmission line characteristics in the observed Nyquist plots.

This pure Cu(II/I) redox mediator exhibits improved charge-transfer rate at the counterelectrode (PEDOT) and faster diffusion transport in the solution. Four pyridine derivatives: 4-tert-butylpyridine, 2,6-bis-tert-butylpyridine, 4-methoxypyridine and 4-(5-nonyl)pyridine are evaluated as electrolyte additives. Base-specific electrochemical properties of the redox mediator are found for Cu(tmby)(2)(2+)/(+), but not for Co(bpy)(3)(3+)/(2+) which is used as control system. Due to steric hindrance, 2,6-bis-ert-butylpyridine has the smallest influence on the mediator's electrochemistry, but is also ineffective for the V-OC enhancement through TiO2 conduction band upshift. Charge-transfer rates at PEDOT surface and diffusion resistances correlate with the basicity (pK(a)) of the used pyridine derivatives. The dye (Y123)-sensitized solar cells are evaluated by solar conversion performance in addition to electron lifetime, charge extraction and long-term stability tests. The optimization of pyridine bases for the Cu-mediated solar cells represents interplay of basicity and coordination ability. In turn, this allows for tuning of the charge transfer rate at counterelectrode and the mass transport in the electrolyte solution.

Herein, we demonstrate a low-cost synthesis of multi-layer graphene films using a thermal chemical vapour deposition (CVD) process in an ambient-air environment without expensive compressed gases while using a renewable source namely soybean oil. Utilization of our low-cost graphene film in DSSCs exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity and high electrical conductivity, and thus delivers superior photovoltaic (PV) efficiency compared to the devices fabricated with graphene films produced from commonly adopted chemical methods. Even though no additional treatments such as heteroatom doping are applied, our low-cost graphene showed great promise in DSSCs. Further enhancement in the efficiency of our multi-layer graphene film based DSSCs is readily achievable by applying simple functional treatments (for example SOCl2). Finally, material cost analysis of our multi-layer graphene film compared to commercial Pt electrode suggests that we can reduce the CE material cost by five fold, making our CVD graphene film a realistic option for application in commercial DSSC systems.

In this perspective dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), which can be obtained in transparent form and with tunable different colors, offer not only an alternative to the traditional silicon solar cells to be applied in particular to decorative effects on windows and glass integrated facades, but also to indoor structures (and furnishings) in order to recapture the energy spent for the inner lighting, thanks to their peculiar ability of operating in diffuse light condition. In this context, porphyrin-based molecules have an immense potential as light harvesting component of dye-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 solar cells, reaching now efficiencies up to about 13%. However the multistep synthesis of the best performing porphyrin dyes, showing a meso substitution pattern, is characterized by very low overall yields compromising their possible applicative development for instance in large photovoltaic (PV) glass modules in competition with the actual commercial PV glass modules based on CuInGaSe2 or CdTe thin voltaic films. In this review the renewed interest in the role of the beta-substituted Zn-II porphyrins for PV application, less studied than the mesa substituted ones, is highlighted. Indeed they can rely on a more accessible synthetic procedure since their tetraaryl porphyrinic core can be easily obtained by a one pot reaction between pyrrole and the appropriate aryl aldehyde. Moreover, their remarkable light harvesting properties in the visible range as well as their peculiar steric hindrance, which strongly opposes to the charge recombination process at the photoanode/dye/electrolyte interface, make this kind of cost-effective porphyrinic dyes more promising for application in new PV glass modules based on DSSC technology, to be applied BIPV.

Recently, a 100-fold increase in the MLCT lifetime was observed in a [Fe(CNC)(2)](2+) complex (CNC = 2,6-bis(3-methylimidazole-1-ylidine)pyridine) which has strong sigma-donating N-heterocyclic carbene ligand in comparison to the weaker field parent [Fe(tpy)(2)](2+) complex (tpy = 2,2':6',2 ''-terpyridine). This study utilizes density functional theory (DFT), time-dependent DFT, and quantum dynamics simulations to investigate the interfacial electron transfer (IET) in [Fe(cCNC)(2)](2+) (cCNC = 4'-carboxy-2,6-bis(3-methylimidazole-1-ylidine)pyridine) and [Fe(ctpy)(2)](2+) (ctpy = 4'-carboxy2,2':6',2 ''-terpyridine) sensitized TiO2. Our results suggest that the replacement of tpy by CNC ligand does not significantly speed up the IET kinetics in the [Fe(cCNC)(2)](2+) TiO2 assembly in comparison to the [Fe(ctpy)(2)](2+) TiO2 analogue. The high IET efficiency in the [Fe(cCNC)(2)](2+) TiO2 assemblies is therefore due to longer lifetime of [Fe(cCNC)(2)](2+) photoactive (MLCT)-M-3 states rather than faster electron injection kinetics. It was also found that the inclusion of conformational sampling in the computational model is important for proper description of the IET processes in these systems, as the models relying on the use of only fully optimized structures may yield misleading results. The simulations presented in this work also illustrate various pitfalls of utilizing properties such as electronic coupling, number of available acceptor states, and driving force, as well as calculations based on Fermi's golden rule framework, to reach conclusions on the IET efficiency in dye-semiconductor systems.",,,,,"Liu, Chang/0000-0001-6008-7513",,,,,,,,,,,,1089-5639,,,,,22-Feb,2018,122,7,,,,,1821,1830,,10.1021/acs.jpca.7b10932,,,,,,,,WOS:000426221000001,29369631,,,,

Amines-typically triethanolamine (TEOA)-are commonly employed as SEDs in such reactions. Dye-sensitized photoreforming of more sustainable, biomass-derived alcohols, on the other hand, was only recently reported by using methanol as the electron donor. In this work, several rationally designed donor-acceptor dyes were used as sensitizers in H-2 photocatalytic production, comparing the efficiency of TEOA and EtOH as SEDs. In particular, the effect of hydrophobic chains in the spacer and/or the donor unit of the dyes was systematically studied. The H-2 production rates were higher when TEOA was used as SED, whereas the activity trends depended on the SED used. The best performance was obtained with TEOA by using a sensitizer with just one bulky hydrophobic moiety, propylenedioxythiophene, placed on the spacer unit. In the case of EtOH, the best-performing sensitizers were the ones featuring a thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole internal unit, needed for enhancing light harvesting, and carrying alkyl chains on both the donor part and the spacer unit.

In both cases, time-of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results showed that the bilayers were successfully formed and that the phosphate layer works as an intermediate between TiO2 and the other species. ToF-SIMS depth profiles of modified nanotubes showed that Ni and Co are present through the whole tube length and reduce in content after heat treatment, in agreement with XPS results. Phosphate groups, on the other hand, are more present in the tubes' depth, and their content on the surface is reduced upon exposure to temperature. The reactivity of the modified surfaces toward carboxylic acid-terminated molecules, as stearic acid and Ru-based N719 dye, was evaluated.

The obtained properties revealed that the synthesized ZnPHy can be used as a photosensitizer for DSC applications. The nature of ZnPHy binding onto the TiO2 surface was investigated using ATR-FTIR and UV-Vis absorption measurements. The amount of adsorbed ZnPHy on TiO2 surface was reasonably fit using the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, with a binding constant value of 1.03 x 10(5) M-1.

Besides that, In2O3-SWCNTs possesses slower electron recombination rate with longer electron lifetime of 3.03ms. Although, In2O3-MWCNTs exhibits higher short circuit current density (J(sc)) than In2O3-SWCNTs the occurrence of defects during acid treatment in MWCNTs caused higher electron recombination rate and decreased the electron lifetime of the cell.

A series of three thiazole dyes with hierarchically overlapping emission and absorption spectra, embedded in a methacrylate-based polymer backbone, is employed to absorb light over the entire visible region. Intermolecular energy transfer in such antenna proceeds via energy transfer from dye-to-dye and eventually to a photosensitizer. Initially, the ground and excited state properties of the three push pull-chromophores (e.g., with respect to their absorption and emission spectra as well as their equilibrium structures) are thoroughly evaluated using state-of-the-art multiconfigurational methods and computationally less demanding DFT and TDDFT simulations. Subsequently, the potential energy landscape for the three dyads, formed by the pi-stacked dyes as occurring in the polymer environment, is investigated along linear-interpolated internal coordinates to elucidate the photoinduced dynamics associated with intermolecular energy and electron transfer processes. While energy transfer among the dyes is highly desired in such antenna, electron transfer, or rather a light-induced redox chemistry, leading to the degradation of the chromophores, is disadvantageous. We performed quantum dynamical wavepacket calculations to investigate the excited state dynamics following initial light-excitation. Our calculations reveal for the two dyads with adjusted optical properties exclusively efficient intermolecular energy transfer within 200 fs, while in the case of the third dyad intermolecular electron transfer dynamics can be observed. Thus, this computational study reveals that statistical copolymerization of the individual dyes is disadvantageous with respect to the energy transfer efficiency as well as regarding the photostability of such antenna.",,,,"Kupfer, Stephan/F-2679-2019","Kupfer, Stephan/0000-0002-6428-7528; Grafe, Stefanie/0000-0002-1747-5809",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-7447,,,,,15-Feb,2018,122,6,,,,,3273,3285,,10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b12190,,,,,,,,WOS:000425571100010,,,,,

Morphological, compositional and optical properties were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), UV-Visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. These particles were added with other constituents in the process of fabricating N719 or N749 stained photoanode for DSSCs. Devices fabricated using 2 wt% phosphor constituent showed an appreciable enhancement in short-circuit current density (Jsc) as well as higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared to devices without phosphor content. The observed enhancement in efficiency is due to downconversion luminescence and light scattering effects arising from these phosphors particles. Further compared with the N719 based device, the enhancement in PCE for N749 based device is 59%. The significant enhancement in PCE is mainly attributed to the optical wavelength matching between the emission of phosphor and the absorbance of the N749 sensitizer.

Mechanical and dielectric relaxation measurements between 120 K and 380 K revealed that the -relaxation observed above 330 K in dry-PVB is shifted quite below room temperature in PVB/additives. Both the additives cause a growing intermolecular cooperativity, the sub-glass -relaxation exhibiting a strength enhanced by a factor 3 and a frequency factor which increases from 10(15) s(-1) to 10(21) s(-1). This discloses an activation entropy as high as 165.7 J/K mol in comparison to 40.8 J/K mol in dry-PVB.

The designed photoanode is expected to significantly increase the light harvesting in DSSCs, due to the synergistic effect of the photonic crystal (PC) effect originates from TiO2 NTPC and the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect from Au NPs. This synergistic effect of the newly designed photoanode and its functionality in DSSCs are discussed by both experimental and simulated results. Moreover, when the SPR band of Au NPs has been tailored to best match with the bandgap of TiO2 NTPC, the maximum enhancement in power conversion efficiency (PCE, 44.7%), which exceeds the sum enhancement producing by coupling individual TiO2 NTPC (22.1%) or Au NPs (18.0%), has been achieved by introducing the designed Au NPs/TiO2 NTPC photoanode, yielding a PCE of 5.63% in the NT-based DSSCs. The work presented here provides new insights into the design and application of SPR/PC coupling architectures for high efficient light management and synergistically enhanced light harvesting in photovoltaic devices.

The resulting composite nanofibers (CNFs) showed beneficial properties when used as a photoanode in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). In particular, the CNFs showed higher conduction band energy than SnO2 and higher electrical conductivity than TiO2. The SnO2-TiO2 CNFs are synthesized by electrospinning a polymeric solution containing equimolar concentration of tin chloride and titanium alkoxide precursors and subsequent annealing. The composite formation is demonstrated by X-ray diffraction and energy dispersive X-ray measurements and morphology by scanning electron microscopy. Synergy in electronic and electrical properties are demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry, absorption spectroscopy, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.

Until now, the most efficient donor-free sensitizers are composed of oligo-thiophenes or covalently connected cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) units with one terminal of cyanoacetic acid as the anchoring group. In this paper, we propose a new strategy for improving the performance of CPDT based donor-free dyes by incorporating an electron-deficient quinoxaline unit into the it-chain. Three new donor-free dyes of SC1-3 with main difference of number and location of long alkyl chains are designed and synthesized. The incorporated electron-deficient quinoxaline unit is found to enhance the intramolecular charge transfer transition and weaken the deprotonation effect on absorption properties, resulting in an improved light harvesting efficiency relative to the reference dye CPDT-3. The influence of long alkyl chains on the optical and electronic properties as well as photovoltaic performance is systematically studied. When applied in iodide-triiodide electrolyte based DSSCs, the best performing quinoxaline based donor-free dye SC-1 shows a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.05%, which is 20% higher than that of reported donor-free dye CPDT-3 (PCE of 6.7%).

The key schematic concept for the molecular design and synthesis of porphyrin sensitizers, with the target of modulation of donor groups by embedding an electron donor into the skeleton of two typical D-pi-A porphyrin models, such as D-porphyrin-A sensitizers (SGT-012 and SGT-016) and D-triple bond-porphyrin-triple bond-BTD-acceptor sensitizers (SGT-052 and SGT-053), was proposed investigate the influence of the donor ability and the bulk of donor groups on the photophysical properties and cell performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Also, based on the photophysical properties and cell performances, the co-sensitisation strategy was conducted to further enhance the cell performances. SGT-012 and SGT-052 porphyrins, containing a strong donor unit, exhibited similar S-band absorption and a slightly red-shifted Q-band absorption compared to SGT-016 and SGT-053 porphyrins containing a weak bulky donor unit, respectively. To further extend the pi-conjugation and absorption to a longer wavelength range, the triple bond at two meso-positions of the porphyrin core and a benzothiadiazole (BTD) strong electron acceptor was introduced to yield SGT-052 and SGT-053, resulting in a red-shift and broad visible region absorption ability. It was indicated that these modifications lead to the formation of a stronger intramolecular charge transfer complex, which is favourable for harvesting sunlight, than those of SGT-012 and SGT-016 porphyrins. To prevent undesirably reduced V-oc caused by charge recombination processes and dye aggregation from porphyrin-sensitized solar cells, HC-Al of co-adsorbent was adopted to fabricate SGT-052- and SGT-053-based solar cells. The DSSCs with SGT-052 and SGT-053 exhibit better light harvesting ability than the DSSCs with SGT-012 and SGT-016 porphyrins, due to the formation of the stronger intramolecular charge transfer complex. Thus, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of SGT-052 and SGT-053-based DSSCs was extremely red-shifted to a wavelength of 800 nm, resulting in higher J(sc) values of 15.3 and 14.6 mA cm(-2), respectively. The DSSC utilising SGT-052 and HC-Al exhibited a higher photovoltaic performance (eta(eff) similar to 9.6%) than did other sensitizers.

It is found that the A-SiO2 nanoparticle as an additive for ionic-liquid electrolyte can significantly improve the photovoltaic performance of quasi-solid-state DSCs, especially the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) through ( 1) negatively shifting the TiO2 conduction band (CB) edge, (2) effectively facilitating the ions transport and (3) remarkably inhibiting the charge recombination. Notably, DSC fabricated using the A-SiO2 based ionic-liquid gel electrolytes achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.30% under 1 sun illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm(-2)), which is higher than that of DSC with the ionic-liquid electrolyte employing N-methylbenzimidazole (NMBI) and Guanidinium thiocyanate (GuNCS) as additives (PCE = 6.23%). Moreover, the A-SiO2 additive is of the universality in organic electrolytes for DSCs and polysulfide electrolytes for QDSCs. The PCE of CdS/CdSe co-sensitized QDSCs using A- SiO2 additives is improved by 34.9% due to the enhancement of short-circuit current density (Jsc) and Voc, resulting in a champion PCE of 7.11%, which is one of the best results for CdS/CdSe co-sensitized QDSCs.

High energy supply is required especially in the developing countries to sustain the lifestyle due to the growth in the world's population and techno-economic city. In fact, the sources of fossil fuel-based energy are limited and the use of fossil fuels can lead to the environmental pollution problem. Accordingly, the combustion of fossil fuels sources will give rise to the global warming issue, i.e., the greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide resulting in erratic weather patterns, such as floods, draughts, etc. In the last two decades, solar photovoltaic cells have been used as the alternatives to generate renewable, sustainable and green energy. High dye absorption rates, efficient charge separation of exciton, and free charge carrier formation as well as large area production at low costs contribute to the emerging photovoltaic technologies. Generally, the materials involved in photoanode section (acting as the platform for the electron collection) are the main key to produce high-efficiency photovoltaic cells. Currently, multijunction based solar panels showed the highest performance of 40% efficiency as compared to that of the conventional Si based solar panels with 22-27% efficiency. Apart of that, DSSCs sensitized by the silyl-anchor and carboxy-anchor dyes have attained the highest efficiency of 14%. In recent years, the metal doping or binary oxide photo-catalyst systems, particularly graphene-TiO2 nanocomposites, have attracted much attention due to their extraordinary characteristics, i.e., (i) photocatalyst activity enhancement, and (ii) accelerated electron mobility to reduce the charge recombination. The high efficiency of the graphene-TiO2 nanocomposites in DSSCs' reaction basically requires a suitable architecture that minimizes electron loss during excitation state and maximizes photon absorption. In order to further improve the immigration of photo-induced charge carriers during excitation state, considerable efforts have to be exerted to further improve the charge mobility and maximize the dye loading. It has also been reported that the properties of graphene-TiO2 nanocomposites primarily depend on the nature of the preparation method, and the role of optimum dopants content incorporated into the graphene photoanode to improve the dye molecules loading and minimize the charge recombination. Therefore, we review recent achievements for different nanoarchitecture of TiO2, as well as graphene-TiO2 composite nanostructured based photoanode in DSSCs performance with future prospects and challenges.

The properties of the various Pt CEs were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), surface area analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and cyclic voltammetry (CV). DSSCs with various Pt CEs were characterized using current density-voltage (J-V), incident photo-current conversion efficiency (IPCE), and EIS measurements. The results show that the power conversion efficiencies of these three types of DSSC devices were between 7.43% and 7.72%.

The charge transfer resistances (R-CT) of the GNAs and GNs were determined from EIS to be 12 Omega and 1.4 x 10(3) Omega, respectively. The coefficient components (A(W)) of the diffusion impedance, known as the Warburg impedance, of GNAs and GNs were 63 Omega Hz(0.5) and 1.2 x 10(2) Omega Hz(0.5), respectively. From these results, it was found that the edge plane area of the graphene aggregates affects both the reaction resistance and electrolyte diffusion in the carbon film.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1388-2481,1873-1902,,,,FEB,2018,87,,,,,,49,52,,10.1016/j.elecom.2017.12.009,,,,,,,,WOS:000424295300012,,,,,

The introduction of the double branching/thiophene spacer lowered the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of CDI, CST, and CDT, making their potentials more positive than that of CSI.

Rutile phase TiO2 nanorods prepared by hydrothermal method were used as photoelectrode and are subsequently characterized by X ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and optical studies. The use of sodium alginate above the photoelectrode has proved to improve the dye concentration in the film by introducing more hydroxyl groups on the surface of TiO2. Anthocyanins extracted from rose petals using citric acid as solvent were used as dye for DSSC. Prior to the sensitization process with anthocyanin dye, the TiO2 film (with sodium alginate) was sensitized with Spirulina. The chlorophylls, xanthophylls, phycocyanins, and amino acids present in Spirulina assist the anthocyanins to bond with TiO2 efficiently.

In general, a DSSC consists of a transparent electrode, a counter electrode, and an electrolyte such as dye. To achieve high power-conversion efficiency in cells, many research groups have focused their efforts on developing efficient dyes for liquid electrolytes. In this work, we report on the photovoltaic properties of DSSCs fabricated using a mixture of TiO2 with nanosized Fe-doped bismuth lanthanum titanate (nFe-BLT) powder). Firstly, nFe-BLT powders were prepared using a high-energy ball milling process and then, TiO2 and nFe-BLT powders were stoichiometrically blended. Direct current (DC) bias of 20 MV/m was applied to lab-made DSSCs. With the optimal concentration of nFe-BLT doped in the electrode, their light-to-electricity conversion efficiency could be improved by similar to 64% compared with DSSCs where no DC bias was applied.

Their absorption spectrum shows a wide tunability that ranges from visible to NIR. Sensitization in the NIR region is crucial for exploiting a particularly intense portion of the solar spectrum. In this work three squaraines will be presented and tested as sensitizers in NiO-based p-type DSSC O4_C2, O4_C4 and O4_C12). The structures of the dyes differ for the length of the alkyl side chain (C2, C4 and C12). Alkyl side chains improve the solubility of the dye, influence the extent of dye loading on the electrode and affect the overall efficiency of devices. The generally low stability of squaraines represents a critical issue in view of their employment as sensitizers of p-DSSC. Such a problem becomes even more evident when this class of molecules is bound onto an acidic surface like the one of the photocathode here employed: non-stoichiometric nickel oxide (NiOx). NiOx possesses a quite acidic character because of the high surface concentration of Ni(III) sites. To buffer the surface acidity of NiOx due to the presence of high-valence states of nickel, we considered the electrode pretreatment with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) prior to sensitization. This assures a major stability of the solar cell.

The redox capabilities of the electrolyte play a major role in determining the overall photo-conversion efficiency (PCE) of dye sensitized solar cells. In this work we report a novel low toxicity and environmentally friendly aqueous organic ionic conductor (AOIC) for high efficiency DSSCs. This study presents the effect of water on the photocurrent density (J(sc)) and stability of DSSCs. Interestingly we have also found that the addition of water to the OICs strongly alters the flat band potential (Efb) of nano-crystalline TiO2, hinders the recombination at the TiO2-AOIC interface and positively shifts the redox potential of I/I-3. Under 1 sun illumination, OICs with 3-methoxypropionitrile solvent and OICs in water show a PCE of 6.02% and 3.57% respectively. This reduced PCE and J-V characteristics are attributed to the negative influence of water on the electron lifetime, electron recombination kinetics and the dark current. Substituting the electron withdrawing group present in the para-position of pyridinium salts mitigates the toxicity and enhances the cationic effect in the electrolyte.

Experimental and theory results reveal that the obtained Co3S4 nanosheets have higher electrochemical properties for the reduction of I-3(-) than bulk due to their larger density of electron states in the nearby of Fermi level facilitating fast electron-transfer and providing highly active sites for catalytic reaction. With the synergistic effect of rGO, electrocatalytic performances of Co3S4 nanosheets can be further optimized.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies revealed that the laser sintering under the optimised condition effectively decreased charge transfer resistance and increased electron lifetime of the TiO2 thin films. The use of the fibre laser with over 40% wall-plug efficiency offers an economically-feasible, industrial viable solution to the major challenge of rapid fabrication of large scale, mass production of mesoporous metal oxide thin film based solar energy systems, potentially for perovsFkite and monolithic tandem solar cells, in the future.

The presence of transition metal elements with a polydentate Schiff base ligand to form metal complexes offers a good platform for combining the chemical, electronic, magnetic, optical and redox properties of metal complexes with those of the organic materials. Metal Schiff base complexes can be incorporated into discrete small molecules, oligomers or polymers, generating new functional materials with useful mechanical, catalytic, thermal, chemical and optoelectronic properties. This review presents the contemporary research development of the field, with emphasis on the fundamental concepts, facile tuning of the photophysical properties and possible energy-related applications of various functional metal Schiff base complexes. To date, many soluble conjugated materials based on metal Schiff base complexes have been generated and studied. They have found an array of energy applications, for example, as converters for light/electricity signals in organic light-emitting diodes and dye sensitized solar cells, energy storage and potential conductive thermoelectric materials.

Cyclic voltammograms (CV) showed that the peak current density (J(A)) and peak spacing (E-pp) of MoS2@RGO CE were smaller than Pt, MoS2, and RGO in DSSCs, owing to the superior carrier transfer properties of graphene, abundant catalytic active sites and low resistance of MoS2@RGO. Furthermore, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of MoS2@RGO CE reached 6.82%, which is higher than that of Pt CE (6.44%).

The biowastes selected for the BCM preparation were divided into three groups: (i) eleven woods, including weeping willow, phoenix, camphor, Chinese fir, maple, peach, poplar, cypress, tea-oil camellia, orange, and chinaberry; (ii) seven leaves, including pine needles, camphor, palm, maple, poplar, Chinese fir, and red after-wood; and (iii) two papers, namely filter paper and facial tissue. Each of the BCM based DSSCs shows a higher efficiency than the graphite based counterparts. The efficiencies of the DSSCs employing the BCM prepared from woods and leaves vary in a range 1.23% -1.91% and 1.07%-1.85%, respectively, while that of the devices using the graphite is 0.77%. The peak efficiency in both groups of the wood and leaf based cells is achieved by employing the phoenix wood and the palm leaf as the raw materials, respectively. Compared with the porous BCM obtained from the woods and leaves, the fibrous BCM fabricated from the papers show better efficiencies of around 4.70% for use in the DSSCs. The high efficiency is mainly attributed to the superior catalytic activity and faster electron transportation for triiodide (13) reduction induced by the unique morphological and structural characteristics of the paper derived BCM, such as hierarchical fibrous carbon skeletons at nanometer and micron scales, abundant exposed microcrystal edges and defects, rough surface at nanoscale with rich burrs and convex microstructures, and oxygen-containing surface functional groups. Furthermore, the efficiency of the DSSCs employing the paper derived BCM is equal to about 88% of that of the devices using the mesoporous carbon synthesized from the phenolic resin mixtures based on polymerization-induced phase separation.

The parameters of short-circuit current density (J(sc)), open circuit voltage (V-oc), the light harvesting efficiency (LHE), injection driving force (Delta G(inject)), and transferred electron number (n(c)), were calculated and discussed in detail. Results indicated that the increasing of thiophene units makes for the enhancement of oscillator strengths (f), although the red shift of vertical electronic absorption spectra is small. For the designed sensitizers with 1-5 thiophene units, their Delta G(inject) and n(c) raise gradually with the increasing of thiophene number. However, for those sensitizers with 6-10 thiophene units, the Delta G(inject) and ne decrease continuously with the increasing of thiophene units.

The significance of this work lies in the combination of favorable experimental and theoretical results in a new class of Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes with the molecular formula of [Ru(E101)(Dicnq)(x)(Y)] which is named M101-M104 when X = 1 and Y = bpy, X = 1 and Y = phen, X = 2, and X = 1 and Y = 2 NCS, respectively. E101 and Dicnq ligands are 1,10-phenanthroline-5,6 heptan ammin and 6,7-dicyanodipyrido[2,2-d: 2', 3'-f] quinoxaline, respectively. The good agreement between the experimental and the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT)-calculated absorption spectra of the M101-104 sensitizers allowed us to provide a detailed assignment of the main spectral features of the investigated dyes. M102 which contained phen as an ancillary ligand had the best photovoltaic performance which can be attributed to the higher light harvesting of M102 in the visible light region. A DSSC based on complex M102 without the E101 ligand did not show any observable power conversion efficiency (PCE), indicating the importance of the amphiphilic ligand, E101. Transient absorption studies indicated that the ratio of k(reg)/k(rec) (k(rec) = the rate constant of the recombination of the dye and k(reg) = the rate constant of regeneration in the presence of the electrolyte) for M101-104 is 1.1, 2.9, 1.3, and 1.2, clearly confirming a weak competition between dye regeneration and recombination. Therefore, because this ratio for M101, 103, and 104 is small, k(reg) approximate to k(rec), the operation of the device has been limited by back electron transports, subsequently enhancing the recombination process. However, the rate of recombination is relatively normal for an efficient DSSC, while the rate of regeneration is very low. Subsequently, the PCE will be poor, confirming the role of aliphatic chains in reducing the recombination process. To obtain a deeper insight into the charge transfer process in the investigated devices, ab initio DFT molecular dynamics simulations and quantum dynamics of electronic relaxation were carried out, clearly showing that the interfacial electron transfer (IET) time scale particularly depends on the type of ancillary ligand. The IET results substantially proved that M102 has the fast lifetime of 2.3 ps and 90 fs for the LUMO and LUMO+ 1, respectively, indicating the experimentally higher PCE of M102 compared to the other three investigated sensitizers.",,,,,"Shahroosvand, Hashem/0000-0001-9185-5490",,,,,,,,,,,,1477-9226,1477-9234,,,,14-Jan,2018,47,2,,,,,561,576,,10.1039/c7dt03769d,,,,,,,,WOS:000419151300030,29239438,,,,

Because of solvent confinement, gel polymer electrolytes are more practical and convenient to use with respect to liquid electrolytes, but in-depth studies are still necessary to optimize their performances. In this work, gel polymer electrolytes of general formulation polyacrylonitrile (PAN)/ethylene carbonate (EC)/propylene carbonate (PC)/MI, where M+ is a cation in the alkaline series Li-Cs, were prepared and used in DSSCs. Their ionic conductivities were determined by impedance analysis, and their temperature dependence showed Arrhenius behavior within the experimental window. FT-IR studies of the electrolytes confirmed the prevalence of EC coordination around the cations. Photo-anodes were prepared by adsorbing organic sensitizer D35 on nanocrystalline TiO2 thin films, and employed to build DSSCs with the gel electrolytes. Nanosecond transient spectroscopy results indicated a slightly faster dye regeneration process in the presence of large cations (Cs+, Rb+).

The performance of DSSC is limited by energy loss larger than ca. 0.3 eV in the electron injection from photoexcited dyes to TiO2. Interfacial charge-transfer transitions (ICT) between TiO2 and dyes provide a direct electron-injection mechanism with internal quantum efficiency of 100% and without energy loss.

The MoS2 is deposited according to island growth mode. As the ED time increases to 40 min, the clusters of MoS2 nano particles enlarge and thicken, but maintain nanopores between the clusters. Additional increase in ED time (to 60 min) causes clusters to merge and make the film denser. Furthermore, this MoS2 film exhibits cracks due to stress accumulated in the film. The film FTO/MoS2 (40 min) shows significantly enhanced electrocatalytic activity compared to other films. This is because the FTO/MoS2 (40 min) not only has more electrochemically active sites but also significantly facilitates charge transfer and mass transport.

By applying density functional theory calculations, we found that the adsorption of a carboxylic acid group-decorated dye molecule reverses the relative stability between the surface oxygen vacancy (Vo(surf)) and Vo(sub) on the anatase (101) surface, which facilitates the migration of the Vo from the subsurface to the surface by overcoming an energy barrier of less than 0.16 eV, which is significantly lower than the 1.01 eV energy barrier on the clean surface. Further, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the Vo(sub) can easily migrate to the surface at room temperature.

The anionic PiIT polyelectrolyte- and polyacrylate-stabilized Pt-nanoparticles (PAA-Pt) were codeposited with cationic poly(diallyldimethylammonium) chloride (PDDA) onto inverse opal (IO), nanostructured indium tin oxide film (nITO) (IO nITO) atop fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO), by using LbL self-assembly. To evaluate the performance of novel conjugated PiIT//PAA-Pt chromphore-catalyst assemblies, interassembly hole transfer was investigated by photocurrent density measurements on FTO//IO nITO electrodes. Enhanced cathodic photocurrent is observed for the polychromophore-catalyst assemblies, compared to electrodes modified with only PiIT, pointing toward photoinduced hole transfer from the excited PiIT to the IO nITO. Prolonged photoelectrolysis experiments reveal H-2 production with a Faradaic yield of approximately 45%.

However, despite these advantages, the energy conversion efficiency of DSSCs has remained low at similar to 10%. To improve the efficiency of DSSCs, research has been done on modifying the materials used in DSSC component parts, such as the photoanode, electrolyte, and counter electrode. Another approach is to modify the photoanode to increase the diffusion coefficient, reduce the recombination rate, and enhance the light behavior. One of the most popular methods for improving the efficiency of DSSCs is by trapping and dispersing the incident light using a scattering layer. Use of a scattering layer has shown various and interesting results, depending on the application, but it is currently used only in a simple form and there has been no deep research on the further potential of the scattering layer. In this study, the scattering center was introduced to maximize the effect of scattering. Light distribution near the scattering center, within or on the photoanode, was investigated using finite differential time domain (FDTD) numerical methods. Based on the FDTD analysis, an optimized, dome-shaped three-dimensional modified structure of a transparent photoanode with minimized scattering centers was introduced and indicated the possibility of modifying the photon distribution in the photoanode to enhance the performance of DSSCs. In addition to using the scattering center, we have introduced the structure of the dome-shaped three-dimensional structure to utilize the light distribution within the photoanode. This novel three-dimensional transparent photoanode and scattering center design increased the energy conversion efficiency of DSSCs from 6.3 to 7.2%. These results provide a foundation for investigating the role of the scattering center via further in-depth research.

The direct natural band gap and Dirac cone structure for graphdiyne are believed to originated from inhomogeneous pi-bonding of differently hybridized carbon atoms and overlap of carbon 2p(z) orbitals. The special electronic structures and pore structures of graphdiyne are responsible for its potential and important applications in the fields of information technology, electronics, energy, catalysis, and optoelectronics. Recent basic and applied research studies of graphdiyne have led to important results; as a result, graphdiyne has become a new research field for carbon materials. The high activity of acetylenic units in graphdiyne provides a good platform for chemical modification and doping. Several approaches have been developed to modify the band gap of graphdiyne, including invoking strain, BN-doping, preparing nanoribbons, and hydrogenation, leading to a new graphdiyne (GDY) or graphyne (GY) derivatives. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in nonmetallic heteroatom doping, especially by nitrogen, boron, or oxygen; by modifying metal atoms for tuning electronic/spintronic properties, enhancing water splitting performance, and applying dye-sensitized solar cells and catalysts; and by surface functionalization of graphdiyne via hydrogenation, hydroxylation, and halogenation to adjust the band gap. Hence, it can be surmised that the electronic structures of graphdiynes can be tuned for specific applications. These results suggest that graphdiynes can be more advantageous than grapheme for tailoring energy band gaps for application in nanoelectronics. We also discuss the influence of doping and functionalization on the electronic properties of graphdiyne and their effects on the synergistic enhancement of photoelectrocatalytic performance.

Electroluminescent properties of aryl(hetaryl) substituted quinazolines with pi-extended conjugated systems proved to be the most important. Incorporation of benzimidazole, carbazole, triphenylene or triphenylamine fragments into quinazoline scaffold allows fabricating materials for organic light-emitting diodes, including white OLEDs and highly efficient red phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes. Moreover, arylvinylsubstituted quinazolines are of great interest as potential structures for nonlinear optical materials and for colorimetric pH sensors. Iridium complexes based on 2-aryl(thienyl) quinazoline or pyrimidine derivatives represent high-efficiency phosphorescent materials for OLEDs. Pyrimidine push-pull systems are of considerable importance as potential photosensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells. Pyrimidine derivatives bearing phenylacridine or phenylphenoxazine fragments at the positions 4 and 6 are capable to function as thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters.",,,,"Chupakhin, Oleg/M-7633-2019","Chupakhin, Oleg/0000-0002-1672-2476",,,,,,,,,,,,1570-1794,1875-6271,,,,,2018,15,6,,,,,793,814,,10.2174/1570179415666180622123434,,,,,,,,WOS:000443020800006,,,,,

Their structure stems from the conjugation of the well-known tris(carboxy-arlyamine) anchoring moiety to a benzothiadiazole acceptor through a fluorene (PP1) or thiophene-fluorene linker (PP2). Appending a NDI secondary acceptor onto PP2 yielded a dyad (PP2-NDI). The push-pull structure is here particularly adapted to the sensitization of p-type semi-conducting materials. All three dyes were investigated by spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques, and their electronic properties were modelled by TD-DFT. In all cases, the new sensitizers exhibit adequate absorption features (spanning from 400 nm to 600 nm, extinction coefficients between 20000 and 27000 M-1 cm(-1)) and their thermodynamic parameters are all in favor of efficient interfacial charge transfers involving NiO. pDSC were constructed with all three dyes; high photoconversion efficiencies (PCE) were reached, especially in the case of dyad PP2-NDI Usc = 5.90 mA/cm(2), V-oc = 143 my, FF = 33.8%, PCE = 0.29%), due to a combination of outstanding electronic properties and increased charge separation state lifetime. Tandem DSC (tDSC) composed of a TiO2 photoanode sensitized by the dye D35 and a NiO photocathode sensitized by PP2-NDI were assembled with two different electrolytes (I-3(-)/I- or T-2/T- based electrolytes). The latter gave PCE among the best ever reported for tDSC Usc = 5.90 mA/cm(2); Voc = 896 my; FF = 63%, PCE = 2.80% in the case of the I-3(-)/I- electrolyte, J(sc) = 4.52 mA/cm(2), V-oc = 840 mV, FF = 60% and PCE = 2.27% for T-2/T- based devices) unraveling the significance of the new dyes presented in this study.

Methods: An efficient and convenient method for synthesis of 2,6-bis-[2-(4-dialkylaminophenyl)vinyl]-4H-Pyran-4-one starting from reaction of 4-fluorobenzaldehyde with 2,6-dimethyl-4H-pyran-4-one in the presence of MeONa as base was described. In continuation, secondary amines were reacted with 2,6-bis((E)-4-fluorostyryl)-4H-pyran-4-one and 2,6-bis-[2-(4-dialkylaminophenyl) vinyl]-4H-Pyran-4-one was obtained as the final product. H-1 and C-13 NMR, FT-IR spectroscopy supported the predicted structure of the products. The UV-Vis absorption spectra of synthesis compound were measured in diluted dichloromethane solution. Results: Knoevenagel reaction of 4-fluorobenzaldehyde and 2,6-dimethyl-4H-pyran-4-one to afford 2,6-bis((E)-4-fluorostyryl)-4H-pyran-4-one was performed in room temperature. To optimize the reaction conditions, a variety of solvents (EtOH, MeOH, t-BuOH) and bases (KOH, NaOH, EtONa, MeONa, t-BuONa) were tested; MeOH/MeONa system was selected as the best condition for this step. The best operative system for nucleophilic aromatic substitution of secondary amines with 2,6-bis((E)-4-fluorostyryl)-4H-pyran-4-one was obtained when DMF was used as a solvent and K2CO3 was employed as the base and HDTMAB as ligands. In addition, malononitrile was reacted with 2,6-bis((E)-4-fluorostyryl)-4H-pyran-4-one and obtained compound was employed in SNAr reaction. The UV-Vis spectroscopy studies were carried out in diluted dichloromethane solution (5x10(-5) M) on the synthesized bis-condensed DCM derivatives. Conclusion: In summary, this study focused on preparation of novel compounds with bis-DCM-type skeleton for application in organic light-emitting diodes, for this purpose, 2,6-bis-[2-(4-dialkylaminophenyl) vinyl]-4H-Pyran-4-one derivatives were prepared from reaction of 4-fluorobenzaldehyde with 2,6-dimethyl-4H-pyran-4-one in the presence of MeONa as base. In continuation, secondary amines were reacted with 2,6-bis((E)-4-fluorostyryl)-4H-pyran-4-one and 2,6-bis-[2-(4-dialkylaminophenyl) vinyl]-4H-Pyran-4-one was obtained as the final product. Additionally, reaction of malononitrile as an active methylene group with 2,6-bis((E)-4-fluorostyryl)-4H-pyran-4-one before N-arylation reaction resulted in 2-(2,6-bis(4-(dialkylamino)styryl)-4H-pyran-4ylidene)malononitrile derivatives.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1570-1786,1875-6255,,,,,2018,15,2,,,,,118,123,,10.2174/1570178614666170711145732,,,,,,,,WOS:000419734300006,,,,,

Introduction of an imine unit into the pi-bridge and extension of the pi-bridge can dramatically improve the light-harvesting ability of DSSCs and suppress the electron recombination, thus uplifting their performance. The solar cell based on FT04 exhibited a broad incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency spectrum and high conversion efficiency (eta=4.95%). However, under the same measuring conditions, the polymer sensitizer CT04, which has a similar structure as that of FT04 but without the imine unit in the conjugated Jt-bridge, gave an eta value of 3.50%, indicating that the sensitizers are promising candidates to improve the performance of DSSCs.

Nanofiberous materials (NFMs) have been widely used in electrochemical energy storage devices in recent years and considered to be promising candidates to address these critical issues because of their excellent properties, such as extremely large surface area, high length/diameter ratio, good flexibility, high porosity, and multiple functionalities. Electrospinning is a particularly low cost, simple, and versatile method to produce nanofibers from various kinds of materials, and the improved coaxial electrospinning can fabricate nanotubes and core/shell structural nanofibers. This review highlights research into the use of electrospinning to create nanofibers for the applications in energy-related devices, mainly including dye-sensitized solar cells, fuel cells, lithium-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and supercapacitors.

The ZnO sample emits wide peaks in the visible range, and the emission intensity of the ZnO-DOL sample increases along with a red-shift (0.38 eV) in the band gap. This shift can be explained using deep level transition, surface plasmon energy of a surfactant, and coupling of ZnO with local surface plasmon energy.

Rieske iron-sulfur protein and FeS catalysts play an important role in natural photosynthesis (NPS), and in artificial photoelectrochemical cells, respectively. Nano-micro composite catalysts (NMCCs) possess not only high catalytic activity but also fast electron transport. Herein, we prepared a nano-micro composite (NMC) of Fe1-xS nanoparticles decorated on sulfur-doped graphene oxide (S-GO) sheets (namely, Fe1-xS@ S-GO-NMC) to be used as a cathode in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). The GO effectively inhibit the aggregation of Fe1-xS nanoparticles. Notably, DSCs based on an Fe1-xS@ S-GO-NMC cathode achieved a high solar-to-electrical conversion efficiency up to 7.23%. The conversion efficiency is, to our knowledge, one of the highest efficiencies for DSCs based on an FeS or FeS2 cathode. Although the Fe1-xS@ S-GO-NMC exhibited a low thermodynamic possibility for redox reactions, it showed a higher kinetic rate than that of Pt for the charge transfer between the reaction medium and the cathode. This indicates that a fast electron exchange process occurs at the interface between the reaction and the cathode. The value of the time constant (tau) corresponding to the charge exchange resistance based on Fe1-xS@ S-GO-NMC (0.0215 ms) was smaller than that obtained with Pt (0.261 ms). Therefore, we ascribed the superior performance of the photoelectrochemical device based on Fe1-xS@ S-GO-NMC to its good electrocatalytic performance.

On increasing fluorination, the heirarchical dendritic-type alpha-Fe2O3 changes to a snow-flake type structure (FTEDA-20%) anisotropically growing along the six directions however, at higher F-TEDA concentrations (>= 30%), loosely held particulate aggregates are seen to be formed. The X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) suggest the maximum fluorinarion of alpha-Fe2O3 at 1.21 at% in 30% F-TEDA. Further, optical absorption studies reveal reduction in optical band gap from 2.10 eV in case of pristine to 1.95 eV for fluorinated alpha-Fe2O3.

Furthermore, anode consisting of thin films of fluorinated alpha-Fe2O3 on FTO also exhibit enhanced current density on illumination of similar to 100 W/m(2).

They enhanced PCE from 4.63% to 5.03% from a balance of the negative and positive effects of the PNWs; most uniquely via efficient charge transport. The PNWs exhibited electron-sink effect causing upward shift of the TiO2 Fermi level with poor charge injection efficiency, at high concentrations. They improved charge collection and resistance against recombination. These results will serve as valuable guide in the field of plasmonic DSSCs and related fields.

The overall power conversion efficiency was improved from 3.0% for the cell with pure ZnO to 4.3% for the cell with 5% SnO substitution.

The rare-earth metal-doped films exhibit a 20-25% larger dye loading and the loading was maximum at the same doping levels where the PCE was maximum, showing this is a big contributor to the improvement. The surface area is larger with rare-earth doped titania as determined by atomic force microscopy and BET analysis, explaining the higher dye loading.

Especially in solar cells employing metal complex redox shuttles such as Co(bpy)(3) [bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine] and Cu(tmby)(2) [tmby = 4,4',6,6'-tetramethyl-2,2'-bipyridine] these factors are crucial in order to obtain efficient devices. Controlling them is achieved by augmenting the liquid redox electrolyte with additives. The most commonly used additive 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) induces both an upward shift of the ZnO conduction band energy and retards recombination thus leading to higher device performance. However, the full potential of the cells cannot be exploited by TBP since high concentrations lead to unwanted side reactions. However, adding another additive such as 2,2'-bipyridine or neocuproine can circumvent these problems and opens a full range of options to tune the properties of the ZnO/electrolyte interface. Photoelectrochemical techniques, such as impedance spectroscopy, current-voltage characterization and photocurrent transient measurements are utilized to reveal the underlying mechanisms of the different additives. Using these additives, power-conversion-efficiencies of 3.56% for a Co(bpy)(3)-based electrolyte and 3.85% for a Cu(tmby)(2)-based electrolyte are achieved for electrodeposited ZnO sensitized with the organic dye DN216.

TiO2 nanotubes in ST-TNTAs vertically grew on the FTO substrate in single crystallized rutile phase, while SrTiO3 grains in cubic perovskite phase dispersed evenly on the surface of TiO2. The sandwich shaped all-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were assembled with TiO2 nanorods, nanotubes and ST-TNTAs as the photoanode, respectively. Once SrTiO3 deposited, the position of Fermi level of the composited semiconductor raised, resulting in the increase of open circuit voltage (Von). Meanwhile, both short-circuit current density (J(SC)) and photoelectrical conversion efficiency (n) increased first and then decreased with the amount of SrTiO3. In comparison to TiO2 nanorods and nanotubes, ST-TNTAs demonstrated the highest photoelectrical conversion efficiency (5.42%) under the irradiation of solar simulator and external quantum efficiency (EQE) at visible region, and also the lowest electron transfer resistance, which further proved that SrTiO3 acted as a good medium for electron transfer between TiO2 and photosensitizer.

Charge transfer and charge transport are pivotal processes in DSSCs, which govern solar energy capture and conversion. These processes can be probed using modern electronic structure methods. Because of the heterogeneity and complexity of the local environment of a chromophore in DSSCs (such as solvatochromism and chromophore aggregation), a part of the solvation environment should be treated explicitly during the calculation. However, because of the high computational cost and unfavorable scaling with the number of electrons of high-level quantum mechanical methods, approaches to explicitly treat the local environment need careful consideration. Two problems must be tackled to reduce computational cost. First, the number of configurations representing the solvent distribution should be limited as much as possible. Second, the size of the explicit region should be kept relatively small. The purpose of this study is to develop efficient computational approaches to select representative configurations and to limit the explicit solvent region to reduce the computational cost for later (higher-level) quantum mechanical calculations. For this purpose, an ensemble of solvent configurations around a 1-methyl-8-oxyquinolinium betaine (QB) dye molecule was generated using Monte Carlo simulations and molecular mechanics force fields. Then, a fitness function was developed using data from inexpensive electronic structure calculations to reduce the number of configurations. Specific solvent molecules were also selected for explicit treatment based on a distance criterion, and those not selected were treated as background charges. The configurations and solvent molecules selected proved to be good representatives of the entire ensemble; thus, expensive electronic structure calculations need to be performed only on this subset of the system, which significantly reduces the computational cost.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1000-6818,,,,,,2018,34,10,,,,,1106,1115,,10.3866/PKU.WHXB201701083,,,,,,,,WOS:000431609600003,,,,,

However, as platinum is very expensive, its price impedes its broad use as a DSSC counter electrode. As an alternative, carbon has been used for this purpose. In this study, carbon has been successfully pyrolyzed from the precursors of table sugar and sucrose through a chemical process, i.e. the dehydration of the precursors with sulfate acid followed by a pyrolysis process, and used as Pt-less counter electrode in a DSSC device. The as-synthesized carbon was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) to obtain crystal structure information and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was employed to carry out morphological and compositional examination. The material activity and performance of the counter electrode in the DSSC device were analyzed using a semiconductor parameter analyzer through current-voltage characteristic curves (I-V).

The five different fabricated thin films were TC14-GO, TC14-rGO, SDS-rGO, Pt and TC14-rGO/Pt hybrid, which were used in dye-sensitised solar cells (DSSCs) as counter electrode (CE). Zinc oxide nanorods/titanium dioxide (ZnO NRs/TiO2 bilayer) was used as photoanode and fabricated through a simple sol-gel immersion and squeegee method. Based on solar simulator measurement, TC14-rGO/Pt hybrid CE thin film exhibited the highest energy conversion efficiency of approximately 0.044% with the V-oc,J(sc) and FF values of approximately 0.618 V, 0.163 mA/cm(2) and 0.387, respectively, compared with other fabricated CE materials. The combination of TC14-rGO/Pt hybrid CE and ZnO NRs/TiO2 bilayer photoanode enhanced the DSSCs photovoltaic performance because of the high conductivity, low oxygen content, high quality and less agglomeration of thin rGO films as a result of improved exfoliation by triple-tail TC14 surfactant.

In this study the influence of refilling the electrolyte in different time intervals is investigated, showing that in this way the power reduction with time can be stopped for at least four months. Variations of the maximum power with time depend additionally on the dye used for the cells, showing the least time-dependence for black beans and maqui berry powder, while cells with black rice, exhibiting the largest power after preparation, suffered a severe power drop during this time which could not completely be counteracted by refilling the electrolyte.

The introduction of photonic crystals can greatly optimize the propagation and distribution of light in solar cells. Photonic crystals can improve the performance of solar cells from five aspects: (1) Photonic crystals constructed as back mirrors to reduce light loss and increase absorption efficiency of solar cell. (2) The interaction between photons and sensitizers can be enhanced by the ""slow photon effect"" of the photonic crystal band gap, which enhances the excitation efficiency. (3) Photonic crystal can be used as a scattering layer, increasing the propagation path of light in the material, forming a resonance enhancement mode in the absorption layer, and improving the light absorption efficiency. (4) Photonic crystals have large specific surface area. Especially three-dimensional photonic crystals can provide excellent carrier for sensitizer, which can effectively increase the load and activity of sensitized molecules and improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency (5) Photonic crystals can be used to reduce the dependence of solar cells on the incident angle of sunlight. For example, when the incident light is tilted, the blue shift of the Bragg position results in more overlap with the dye absorption peak, generating a higher efficiency that partially compensates the reduced photon flux due to light inclination. However, photonic crystals in different locations of the solar cell will improve or inhibit photoelectric conversion efficiency. Therefore, the fully understanding of light manipulation of photonic crystals and their correctly application is the key to improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency. Here, the applications of different types of photonic crystals in silicon solar cells and sensitized solar cells are summarized, at the same time the possible problems are also analyzed and reviewed.",,,,"ZHOU, XUE/F-6129-2013; li, mingzhu/F-5586-2011","li, mingzhu/0000-0002-5548-9160",,,,,,,,,,,,0567-7351,,,,,,2018,76,1,,,,,9,21,,10.6023/A17070320,,,,,,,,WOS:000428734300001,,,,,

This is achieved by promoting ionic conduction and increasing optical path length through multiple-light scattering within the photovoltaic devices. In LCs, it is well known that the length of the alkyl chain plays an important role since the LC morphology and mesophase stabilisation depend strongly on the alkyl group. In this work, liquid crystal-polymer composite electrolytes (LC-PEs) are prepared using nematic LCs with different alkyl chain lengths. The morphology of the LC-PEs is investigated and correlated with their electrical properties. Subsequently, DSSCs are prepared using the LC-PEs as a direct example of its application. It is shown that increasing the alkyl chain length of the LCs reduces the efficiency of the solar devices. The longer alkyl chains are speculated to intertwine, thus trapping the mobile ions and reducing the bulk ionic conductivity. For the same reason, longer alkyl chain LCs are thought to be unable to passivate the TiO2 surface through the adsorption of cyanobiphenyl groups and hence the higher probability of back recombination reaction between the electrons in TiO2 and PE.

Herein we synthesize 3D nanorhombus nickel nitride (Ni3N) thin films by adopting a reactive radio frequency magnetron sputtering process. The as-deposited 3D nano rhombus Ni3N thin films were utilized as cost-effective electrodes in the fabrication of supercapacitors (SCs) and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The structure, phase formation, surface morphology and elemental composition of the as-deposited Ni3N thin films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The electrochemical supercapacitive performance of the Ni3N thin films was examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) techniques, in 3 M KOH supporting electrolyte. The areal capacitance of the Ni3N thin film electrode obtained from CV analysis was 319.5 mF cm(-2) at a lower scan rate of 10 mV s(-1). Meanwhile, the Ni3N thin film showed an excellent cyclic stability and retained 93.7% efficiency of its initial capacitance after 2000 cycles at 100 mV s(-1). Interestingly, the DSSCs fabricated with a Ni3N CE showed a notable power energy conversion efficiency of 2.88% and remarkable stability. The prominent performance of the Ni3N thin film was ascribed mainly due to good conductivity, high electrochemically active sites with excellent 3D nano rhombus structures and high electrocatalytic activity. Overall, these results demonstrate that the Ni3N electrode is capable of being considered for efficient SCs and DSSCs.

Here, examinations are limited to non-toxic substances due to planned future application on textile fabrics, i. e., to TiO2, graphite, and natural dyes. During experiments on the TiO2 layer, the reproducibility of the experiment turned out to be a crucial factor, limiting the significance of the experimental findings. Thus, the main goal of this paper is the description of possibilities to standardize the production under laboratory conditions by eliminating distorting factors. Specifically, the pressure by which the glass plates with conductive coatings, serving as electrodes, are pushed together to close the solar cell was found to significantly influence the results.

Brassica oleracea contains high levels of anthocyanins in leaf sap vacuoles, and there are many viable extraction techniques that vary in terms of simplicity, environmental impact, cost, and extract photochemical/electrochemical properties. The efficiency of value added biotechnologies from flavonoid is a function of anthocyanin activity/concentration and molecule stability (i.e., ability to retain molecular resonance under a wide range of conditions). In this paper, we show that block cryoconcentration and partial thawing of anthocyanin from B. oleracea is a green, facile, and highly efficient technique that does not require any special equipment or protocols for producing enhanced value added products. Cryoconcentration increased anthocyanin activity and total phenol content approximately 10 times compared with common extraction techniques. Cryoconcentrated extract had enhanced electrochemical properties (higher oxidation potential), improved chroma, and higher UV absorbance than extract produced with other methods for a pH range of 2-12, with minimal effect on the diffusion coefficient of the extract. As a proof of concept for energy harvesting and sensor applications, dye sensitized solar cells and pH-sensitive thin films were prepared and tested. These devices were comparable with other recently published biotechnologies in terms of efficacy, but did not require expensive/environmentally detrimental extraction or concentration methods. This low cost, biorenewable, and simple method can be used for development of a variety of value added products. (c) 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

Furthermore, UV-vis spectroscopy was used to analyze the optical properties while the Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) was used for the study of electrochemical properties of the samples, which have revealed that PANI-SnO2 nanocomposite can act as a suitable counter electrode in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).

The nanocomposite, prepared by chemical oxidation polymerization of aniline in the presence of CB, was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Different amount of CB were added in the polymer matrix to optimize the electro-catalytic activity of the CB/PAniNT nanocomposite towards reduction of I-3(-) to I-. Cyclic voltammetry, current density-voltage measurements, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Tafel plot analysis showed that incorporation of CB resulted in an augmented active catalytic surface area and enhanced charge transfer from CE to the electrolyte.

Modulated electrical fields based on pulsed AC and a sweeping voltage profile were used. The photovoltaic performance of the assembled solar cells showed a significant difference between the films produced in different electrical field conditions.

With the optimized double-layered N-doped Zn2SnO4 as photoanodes of flexible dye-sensitized solar cells, the corresponding photoelectric conversion efficiency is 2.302% compared to 1.332% and 1.826% in case of pure Zn2SnO4 nanosheets and N-doped Zn2SnO4 nanosheets; The double-layered N-doped Zn2SnO4 is also determined to be high-performance immobilized photocatalyst with a better recyclability for the photodegradation of organic pollutant under sunlight irradiation; More importantly, the preparation methods is also applicable to fabricate other composite oxides on wire-shaped substrate for more practical applications in flexible devices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0272-8842,1873-3956,,,,JAN,2018,44,1,,,,,905,914,,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.021,,,,,,,,WOS:000416877900124,,,,,

Wormlike meso-layers prepared at different spin speeds were characterized by TEM analysis. The correlation between spin speed and thickness and porosity of the films were investigated using ellipsometry method. The crystallinity and surface area of the films obtained at a repeated thermal treatment method and different temperatures were investigated by XRD and BET techniques. UV-vis spectroscopy and cross-sectional SEM images were also used to characterize the films. Finally, the mesoporous thick films (5.7 mu m) were used in DSSC devices and their photovoltaic performances were examined. The optimum mesoporous film exhibited an open-circuit voltage (V-OC) of 0.729 V, short-circuit current density (J(SC)) of 14.93 mA cm(-2), fill factor of 0.68 and a power conversion efficiency of 7.35%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1369-8001,1873-4081,,,,JAN,2018,73,,,,SI,,99,105,,10.1016/j.mssp.2017.07.031,,,,,,,,WOS:000415921400015,,,,,

Especially, various amounts of ethanol generated different degrees of supersaturation in precursor solution. It allowed us to systematically change the width, lengths, and crystallinity of a vertically aligned 1-D nanorod structure of TiO2 films. The oriented attachment, confirmed by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, was shown to be responsible for their lateral growth of TiO2 nanorods bundled by numerous well-oriented nanowires and their vertical growth. TiO2 nanorod thin films were also characterized via X-ray diffraction and UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer to find a correlation between the process conditions and nanostructural evolution.

We fabricate DSC devices with various arrangement styles and compositions of the electrodes in the forms of monolayer and double layer films. For this purpose, the solvothermal synthesized TiO2 cubic particles (100-600 nm) are employed as the scattering layer, whereas TiO2 nanoparticles (15-30 nm) synthesized via a combination of solvothermal and sol-gel routes are used as the active layer of devices. We improve the photovoltaic characteristics of DSCs by two mechanisms. First, the light harvesting of DSC devices made of nanoparticles is improved by controlling the thickness of monolayer films, reaching the highest efficiency of 7.0%. Second, the light scattering and electron collection efficiency are enhanced by controlling the composition of double layer films composed of mixtures of TiO2 nanoparticles and cubes, obtaining the maximum efficiency of 8.21%. The enhancements are attributed to balance between charge transfer resistance and charge recombination of photo-generated electrons as well as dye loading and light scattering.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-7820,1551-2916,,,,JAN,2018,101,1,,,,,293,306,,10.1111/jace.15184,,,,,,,,WOS:000414367400033,,,,,
