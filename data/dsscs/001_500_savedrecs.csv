Although the ubiquitous combination of the I-/I-3(-) redox couple demonstrates high power conversion efficiency (PCE), it suffers from several limitations such as a large potential difference of approximately 560 mV between the Fermi level of I-/I-3(-) and the HOMO level of the N719 dye as well as high visible light absorption. These limitations cause inefficient dye-regeneration and significantly enhance the back reaction rate of photoelectrons to I-3(-) in the electrolyte. This review discusses recent progress in the conception and device performance of different binary redox couples in DSSCs based on lowering potential differences, the back reaction of photo-induced electrons, the absorption of visible light, and improvement of dye regeneration. We specifically focus on recent strategies targeted for effectively increasing both the open circuit voltage of DSSCs up to (similar to)100 mV and the PCE to above 10%; these strategies include introduction of binary redox couples or additional redox species to conventional iodine-based electrolytes.

Here, the hysteresis behavior in Dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is studied based on the electrolyte. Three electrolytes were used containing Sodium iodide (NaI), Potassium iodide (KI), and Cesium iodide (CsI). Current density-voltage characteristics was measured for each device at fast (1 V/s) scan rate, medium (0.5 V/s) scan rate, and slow (0.1 V/s) scan rate. The charging-discharging process at TiO2/electrolyte interface during forward and reverse scan directions is propose as the responsible mechanism for hysteresis in DSSC. Based on our investigation, hysteresis phenomenon is strongly dependent on the size of alkali metal cation as well as J-V sweep scan rate. Hysteresis is dominant for NaI electrolyte with the smallest Na+ cation size while it diminishes for KI and CsI electrolytes with bigger K+ and Cs+ sizes, respectively. Also, using CsI electrolyte along with the slow scan rate of 0.1 V/s is the perfect combination for the minimal hysteresis in the solar cell. In addition, hysteresis index calculation was redefined based on the intercept cross points between forward and reverse scan directions. Our results suggest that DSSC has a charge storage efficiency accompanied by its primary function as a power conversion device. The charge storage ability occurs for V > V-OC during the forward scan and it is significant for smaller cation size. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to the confinement of organic ligand oleylamine, the Co9S8 NCs with the size of ca. 8 nm were mainly dispersed on the surface of RGO (Co9S8/RGO). The Co9S8/RGO composite with the optimal contents (RGO contents of 44.4 wt%) was prepared by controlling the amount of graphene oxide (GO) added, which possessed the optimal catalytic active site numbers and electron transfer ability as it showed a higher PCE of 7.31%.

Generally, the inclusion of TiO2 nanofillers in a polymer gel electrolyte causes an enhanced diffusion coefficient and a reduced charge transfer resistance at the electrolyte/counter-electrode interface, thereby improving the photovoltaic performance of the corresponding solar cell. Herein, liquid electrolytes are treated by TiO2 nanoparticles, and the resultant electrolytes yield similar effects on both the electrolyte properties and cell performance. This result suggests a facilitated movement of the triiodide species; however, it cannot be elucidated by the Grotthuss-type mechanism, because of the absence of nano particles in such liquid electrolytes. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis shows that the TiO2 particles can adsorb iodide ions through their acidic surfaces. The adsorption of iodide ions leads to negatively charged surfaces, which further induces attraction to cations. As a result, cation concentrations in the electrolyte are reduced, and furthermore, the triiodide species can move more easily owing to the attenuated electrostatic interaction with cations.

Photovoltaic measurement results indicate that the MoSe2 electrodes prepared at 400 degrees C has the optimized performance, and the corresponding DSSCs provide an energy conversion efficiency of 6.83% which is comparable than that of the reference DSSC with platinum as counter electrode (6.51%). With further increas-ing the preparation temperature of the MoSe2 electrodes, the corresponding DSSCs decrease gradu-ally to 5.96% for 550 degrees C. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) reveal that charge transfer resis-tance (R-ct) of MoSe2 electrodes is rising with increase of the temperature from 400 to 500 degrees C, sug-gesting a downward electrocatalytic activity.

In this work, the TiO2/rGO nanocomposites with anchoring of TiO2 nanoparticles on rGO nanosheets have been fabricated, and a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) strategy with 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA) as probe was performed to reveal the interfacial CT in the nanocomposites. There are obvious enhancements in the SERS intensity and the degree of CT (rho(CT)) in the 4-MBA/TiO2/rGO/4-MBA system compared with those of 4MBA/TiO2 and 4-MBA/TiO2 + rGO/4-MBA (TiO2 + rGO is a physical mixture of TiO2 and rGO) due to the chemical interaction and the interfacial CT between TiO2 and rGO in the nanocomposite. It is indicated that the interfacial chemical interaction in the nanocomposite is an essential requirement for occurrence of the interfacial CT. The interfacial CT process can be evaluated quantitatively by the p m . in SERS spectrum. The p m . shows an obvious increasing trend with the increase of rGO amount in TiO2/rGO nanocomposites, and then reaches a saturation when the amount of rGO is 1.0%. And also, to further understanding of this CT progress, the model of the CT mechanism has been proposed. Furthermore, as-prepared TiO2/rGO nanocomposite can also be served as an effective SERS-active substrate for the ultrasensitive detection of analyzes. The minimum detectable concentration of 4-MBA on the TiO2/rGO substrate can reach to 1 x 10(-7) mol/L, which is comparable to a noble metal substrate. Even, for p-aminothiophenol target molecule whose SERS signals cannot almost be observed on the ordinary TiO2 substrate, the minimum detectable concentration can reach to a value as low as 1 x 10(-8) mol/L on the TiO2/rGO substrate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0169-4332,1873-5584,,,,1-Sep,2019,487,,,,,,938,944,,10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.05.122,,,,,,,,WOS:000471996400107,,,,,

The effects of the EDA and the L-cysteine complexing agents and their concentrations (ranging from 0 to 2 mM) on the structural and optical properties of the ZNRs were studied using various techniques.

Charge transfer dynamics and light harvesting properties were studied by absorbance spectroscopy, I-V measurements, voltage-decay measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The introduction of EosinY to the precursor solution was found to increase the diameter of the rods and to produce nano-scale roughness. This lead to an improvement in dye loading and surface passivation against recombination leading to both an increase in V-oc and Jsc of the device, compared to ZnO nanorods deposited without EosinY. Subsequent treatment of as-deposited ZnO nanorods in aqueous NaOH increased the surface area by producing tube-like nanostructures, without compromising the electron mobility. When compared to untreated nanorods, this morphology improves dye loading and increases electron lifetime, which then leads to a higher fill factor and V-oc. A significant increase in J(sc) and drastic decrease in V-oc are obtained for a hybrid electrode consisting of nanorods and nanoparticles which is both caused by a higher surface area and faster back-recombination.

Our goal in this work is to examine the influence of several bridging functional groups between the BODIPY and oxasmaragdyrin systems forming dyads (D), as potential components of DSSC, on the aromatic, photophysical, and charge transport properties. A set of 11 dyads made of the oxasmaragdyrin with 2,6-dimethoxyphenyl and methylamine groups in two of their meso carbons (S) and the 4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (BODIPY, B) moieties that differ in the binding bridge between them has been analyzed with density functional theory (DFT). The geometries were optimized with the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of theory employing D3 Grimme's correction, and a set of six functionals (B3LYP, BHandHLYP, CAM-B3LYP, PBE0, wB97X, TPSSh) was evaluated for reference systems in time-dependent DFT calculations. We found that TPSSh presents the best agreement with the available data of UV-vis spectra, so it was used for calculation of the electronic absorption spectra of the 11 oxasmaragdyrins and 11 dyads. When the bridge between S and B consists of one (D3), two (D5), or three acetylene units (D6), a strong absorption band in the infrared region around 1000 nm can be achieved. These bands correspond to charge-separated excited states that favor a panchromatic absorption in that region. The aromaticity index NICS(0) computed at the macrocycle center ring critical point using the GIAO/B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of theory shows in all these systems an aromatic character for the oxasmaragdyrin macrocycle (from -10.7 to -12.4 ppm). We also found that all dyads present a favorable electron injection toward the semiconductor TiO2 because the LUMO energy of the dyad is higher than the conduction band of the semiconductor (-4.3 eV) used in a solar cell. Besides, the HOMO energy of the dyads D3, D5, and D6 is lower than the redox potential (-4.8 eV) of a mediator as the I-/I3(-) system used to recover it after circulation of electrons. Nonequilibrium Green's function-based calculations performed for a couple of dyads, with (D6) and without (D4) a significant charge transfer band, connected to Au electrodes show that D6 was to be a better conductor, in agreement with the charge transfer results obtained from the photophysical properties.

Using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT we have studied the properties of new and abundant metal ion-based polypyridyl dyes for p-type DSSCs and compared with ruthenium and other scarce metal ions. Molecular geometries, electronic structures, and optical absorption spectra have been calculated using an implicit solvent corresponding to acetonitrile. The calculated fair light harvesting efficiency, high hole injection efficiency and Gibbs free energy for the hole injection and longer excited state lifetime (important for reflecting the efficiency of solar cells) for the new abundant metal ions (V3+ and Cr2+) based dyes could provide promising sensitizers for efficient next generation DSSC's for p-SC.",,,,"Gross, Axel/B-4023-2014","Gross, Axel/0000-0003-4037-7331",,,,,,,,,,,,0020-7608,1097-461X,,,,15-Aug,2019,119,16,,,,,,,e25963,10.1002/qua.25963,,,,,,,,WOS:000473227100001,,,,,

Further improving the ionic conductivity of ionic liquid electrolytes is critical to the performance enhancement of DSSCs. Here, multi-component eutectic salts by mixing four ILs are proposed to achieve higher ionic conductivity compared to the individual one. In addition, the effect of mixing strategy on the eutectic salts was systematically investigated by diverse structural, thermal, electrochemical and photovoltaic characterization in detailed. It revealed that mixing strategy could not only tune the solid-state property of individual ILs to liquid-state eutectic salts, but also greatly improve the ionic conductivity of final multi-component eutectic salts. Thus, based on the multi-component eutectic salt, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.81% could be obtained by the resultant device. Moreover, the DSSCs with multi-component eutectic salt also display better stability than the referenced device with volatile organic solvent.

The pattern of XRD depicted that the dominating phase in the sample with x = 0 is a rutile tetragonal phase with the P4(2)/mnm space group. An increase in GeO2 concentration leads to an appearance and rise of another hexagonal phase structure of a-GeO2 with the P3(22)1 space group. Data obtained from the UV-visible spectroscopy measurements reflect that the optical energy gap (Eoptical) increases with increasing GeO2 content, while the optical refractive index decreases. J-V photovoltaic characteristics confirm that the DSSCs doped with low-concentration doping, x = 0.05 and 0.1 of GeO2 have higher values for conversion efficiency (.), fill factor and short circuit current density (Jsc) compared with samples with high-concentration doping (x = 0.(2) and 0.3) of GeO2.

Accordingly, low-cost, highly active, and stable alternatives to Pt are highly desired. Herein, an intrinsically conductive perovskite oxide is reported as a new cathode for DSSCs using a simple nonmetal element doping strategy. The phosphorus-doped perovskite oxide (SrCo0.95P0.05O3-delta [SCP]) shows superior activity/durability for the triiodide (I-3(-)) reduction reaction (IRR) and structural stability relative to the parent compound (SrCoO3-delta [SC]) due to the greatly enhanced electrical conductivity and the stabilization of the perovskite structure. The internal conducting pathways are demonstrated to be very important to obtain high IRR activity of the perovskite cathode, even when the cathode is incorporated with conductive multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The DSSC with the N719 dye and SCP/MWCNTs cathode displays a superior power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.1% to those with Pt (8.11%) and SC/MWCNTs (6.80%) cathodes. In addition, the DSSC with the C101 dye and SCP/MWCNTs cathode shows an attractive PCE of 12.2% with an enhancement of 23%, as compared with the Pt cathode, suggesting that the SCP/MWCNTs composite can be one of the best substitutions to the Pt cathode, which can benefit the future industrialization of DSSCs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2367-198X,,,,,AUG,2019,3,8,,,,,,,1900108,10.1002/solr.201900108,,,,,,,,WOS:000480619600014,,,,,

PCL in DMF-KI electrolyte promotes salt dissociation but adversely increases the electrolyte viscosity. From the impedance measurement, PCL causes greater reduction in ion mobility, mu than increment in ion density, n. Consequently, conductivity of DMF-KI electrolyte decreases with PCL.

An electric furnace is used to test the ultrashort calcination of Pt-SnOx catalysts used as counter electrodes (CEs) of DSSCs. By using a conventional electric furnace instead of an atmospheric pressure plasma jet (Metals 8:690, 2018), the effect of reactive plasma species can be ruled out, and only the bare thermal effect is considered in this study. Scanning electron microscopy reveals that Pt-SnOx nanoparticles are well-distributed on the substrates. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicates the conversion of a large amount of metallic Pt and oxidized Sn. No metallic Pt is observed with 5-s calcination; however, similar to 74% Pt is converted into metallic Pt with 15-s calcination. Further increasing the calcination time does not increase the conversion rate of metallic Pt. By contrast, metallic Sn shows its maximum conversion rate of similar to 18% with 30-s calcination. Further increasing the calcination time to 30 min reduces the metallic Sn content to similar to 6%, possibly owing to Sn re-oxidation. When applying Pt-SnOx catalysts to CEs of DSSCs, the efficiency greatly increases as the calcination time increases from 15 to 30 s. The efficiency remains relatively unchanged for calcination time of 60 s to 30 min. The efficiencies of DSSCs with a Pt-SnOx CE calcined at longer processing times (>= 60 s) are comparable to those of DSSCs with conventional Pt CEs.

On the basis of our previously reported dye XW36, XW45 was synthesized by introducing a BTD unit to broaden the absorption spectrum, further introducing a hexyl-substituent into the BTD unit afforded XW46, and an additional fluorine atom was introduced to the carboxyphenyl acceptor to afford XW47. As expected, the BTD unit obviously broadens and red-shifts the absorption threshold of XW45-XW47 to ca.750 nm. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were fabricated based on a cobalt electrolyte using chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) as the coadsorbent. Under full sun illumination, XW45 exhibits an efficiency of 9.73%, which is slightly lower than that of 10.19% obtained for the reference dye SM315. By contrast, XW46 and XW47 show higher efficiencies than SM315 owing to the improved anti-aggregation ability associated with the hexyl group on the BTD unit and better ICT effect induced by the fluorine atom on the carboxyphenyl unit. Thus, XW47 exhibits the highest efficiency of 10.41% among the porphyrin dyes. Furthermore, PT-C6 was used as the cosensitizer to improve the light harvesting ability and efficiencies of the cells due to its broad absorption within 350-560 nm. Thus, high efficiencies of 10.32%, 11.38% and 10.90% were achieved for the cosensitized solar cells based on XW45-XW47, respectively, owing to the obviously enhanced photo-current density (J(SC)). In addition, under 30% full sun illumination, XW46+PT-C6 exhibits a high efficiency of 13.08%.

Hole hopping was initiated by a potential step 500 mV positive of the E-1/2 (Ru-III/(II)) potential or by pulsed laser (532 nm, 8 ns fwhm) excitation and monitored by visible absorption chronoabsorptometry and time-resolved absorption anisotropy measurements, respectively. The hole hopping rate constant k(R) extracted from the potential step data revealed self-exchange rate constants that followed the trend: TiO2[Ru(OMe)(2)P (k(et) = 1.4 x 10(6) s(-1)) > TiO2 vertical bar RuP (7.1 X 10(5) s(-1)) > TiO2 vertical bar Ru(dtb)(2)P (6.5 x 10(4) s(-1)). Analysis of the anisotropy data with Monte Carlo simulations provided hole hopping rate constants for TiO2 vertical bar RuP and TiO2 vertical bar Ru(dtb)(2)P that were within experimental error the same as that measured with the potential step. The hole hopping rate constants were found to trend with the TiO2(e(-))vertical bar Ru-III -> TiO2 vertical bar Ru-II charge recombination rate constants. The atomic layer deposition of an similar to 10 angstrom layer of Al2O3 on top of the dye-sensitized films was found to prevent hole hopping by both initiation methods even though the chromophore surface coverage exceeded the percolation threshold and excited-state injection was efficient.

This enhancement is ascribed to the combined effects of plasmon decay, scattering, near-field enhancement, and exciting charge carriers in semiconductors through plasmon-induced resonance energy transfer (PIRET) and hot electron injection (HEI). PIRET and HEI processes appeared between MNPs, and semiconductors have been intensively investigated; however, it is not clear how the collaborative effect of PIRET and photon-induced direct and indirect electron transfer (PICT) occurred between plasmonic metals and dyes, and the interference of different charge separation channels (CSCs) starting from PIRET and PICT affects the PCE of DSSCs. This work aims to address these issues. We apply a model Hamiltonian method, which obviously includes both PIRET and PICT processes from Au MNP to dye molecules and incorporates the dye's electron-phonon interaction, to investigate the carrier dynamics. It is found that PIRET deforms the wavepacket dynamics of the molecular excited state and results in ten-fold enhancement of dye absorption. MNPs augment light absorption and increase the electron density in empty molecular orbitals of the dye molecule. Consequently, this enhances the interfacial charge separation. Furthermore, we observed the interference behavior of two CSCs and gave a full-scale insight into the correlation between the constructive/destructive interference and the electronic-state properties as well as carrier-phonon interactions.

The synthesized dye shows higher absorption wavelength and molar extinction coefficient (480 nm and 42 375 M-1 cm(-1)) compared to those of the reference TA-St-CA dye (469 nm and 21 803 M-1 cm(-1)).

Finally, treated and untreated TiO2 nanofibers were used in n-i-p solar cells. Photovoltaic characteristics revealed that lanthanum treatment was beneficial, whereas lithium treatment was found to be detrimental to the device performance for both dye-sensitized and perovskite solar cells.

In this report we describe co-sensitization of dyes with pyridine anchoring groups with carboxylic-acid based ones having complementary absorption spectra. Six new pyridine based dyes with colors ranging from yellow to turquoise have been synthesized and characterized. T220, a yellow dye, was co-sensitized with Dyenamo Blue, a commercially available blue dye. This approach showed good performance enhancement compared to individual dye sensitized cells with a Co(II/III) redox mediator. An increase in the photocurrent (J(SC)), photo-voltage (V-OC) and thus total efficiency (PCE%) were seen. The close packing of the two dyes in the co-sensitized devise caused a decrease in the electron recombination processes at the TiO2/electrolyte interface, thus resulting in higher V-OC values. Such an increase in dye coverage results in a blocldng behavior at the TiO2/electrolyte interface, as mirrored in the performed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments, where higher charge recombination resistance (R-CT) and longer electron lifetime were measured in the co-sensitized DSSCs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0038-092X,,,,,15-Jul,2019,187,,,,,,108,114,,10.1016/j.solener.2019.05.037,,,,,,,,WOS:000474327400010,,,,,

Herein, the plasmonic effect is introduced to improve the photoanode features of the photovoltaic cell, a dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC), and better electrocatalytic features are introduced in the electrode containing the sensing element. In brief, the DSSC had a counter-electrode of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) on an FTO glass modified by a plastic antibody of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene and pyrrol. The photoanode had dye sensitized TiO2 modified with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to increase the cell efficiency, aiming to improve the sensitivity of the response of hybrid device for the target biomarker. The target biomarker was carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The response of the hybrid device evidenced a linear trend from 0.1 ng/mL to 10 mu g/mL, with an anionic slope of 0.1431 per decade concentration. The response of the plastic antibody for CEA revealed great selectivity against other tumour markers (CA 15-3 or CA 125). The colour response of the electrochromic cell was also CEA concentration dependent and more sensitive when the hybrid device was set-up with a photoanode with AuNPs. A more intense blue colour was obtained when higher concentrations of CEA were present. Overall, this improved version of the self-powered and self-signalled set-up has zero-requirements and is particularly suitable for point-of-care analysis (POC).

The porphyrin dyes contained the same D-ethynyl-zinc porphyrinyl (ZnP)-ethynyl-benzothiadiazole-acceptor platform, but their donor groups varied from phenylene (Ph) in SGT-053 as a reference dye to the thieno[3,2-b]benzothiophene (TBT) and 4-hexyl-4H-thieno[3,2-b]indole (TI) moieties in SGT-030 and SGT-031, respectively. The effects of the extended auxiliary pi-spacer in the D-pi-A-structured porphyrin sensitizers on the molecular and photovoltaic properties were investigated via photophysical and electrochemical experiments as well as theoretical calculations. With the trend in conjugation length (Ph < TBT approximate to TI) and the donating ability of the pi-spacer (Ph < TBT < TI), the absorption maxima and molecular absorptivity increased in the order SGT-053 (Ph) < SGT-030 (TBT) < SGT-031 (TI). The incorporation of TBT and TI promoted significant enhancements in the light-harvesting properties by reducing the energy gap and efficiently improving electronic communication. The DSSCs based on SGT-030 (10.80%) and SGT-031 (10.89%) with coadsorption of 4-(3,6-bis(4-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)phenyl)-9H-carbazol-9-yl)benzoic acid in conjunction with the [Co(bpy)(3)](2+/3+)-based electrolyte showed better power conversion efficiency than that of SGT-053 (9.10%). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis unveiled that the difference in J(sc) and V-oc originates mainly from the twisted orientation between D and ZnP by the introduction of TBT and TI. This result indicated that the introduction of an extended auxiliary pi-spacer in the donor part is a rational molecular design approach to improve photovoltaic performance by enhancing the light-harvesting ability and hindering charge recombination on the TiO2 photoanode.",,,,,"Kim, Hwan Kyu/0000-0002-6189-5237",,,,,,,,,,,,1944-8244,1944-8252,,,,10-Jul,2019,11,27,,,,,24067,24077,,10.1021/acsami.9b05510,,,,,,,,WOS:000475532200027,31204470,,,,

All three gave modest performances in liquid junction devices with I-3(-)/I- as the electrolyte. The distinct spectroscopic properties of the porphyrins allowed a detailed investigation of the adsorption behaviour and kinetics for charge transfer at the NiO vertical bar porphyrin interface. The adsorption behaviour was modelled using the Langmuir isotherm model and the phosphonate anchoring group was found to have the highest affinity for NiO (6.65 x 10(4) M-1) and the fastest rate of adsorption (2.46 x 10(7) cm(2) mol(-1) min(-1)). The photocurrent of the p-type dye-sensitized solar cells increased with increasing dye loading and corresponding light harvesting efficiency of the electrodes. Coordinating the zinc to a pyridylfunctionalized fullerene (C60PPy) extended the charge-separated state lifetime from ca 200 ps to 4 ns and a positive improvement in the absorbed photon to current conversion efficiency was observed. Finally, we confirmed the viability of electron transfer from the appended C60PPy to phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester, a typical electron transporting layer in organic photovoltaics.

Multiple functional layers of electrodes and active materials have been deposited on everyday use polyester cotton woven fabric and high-temperature resistant glass fiber fabric. The poly cotton fabric limits processing temperatures to 150 degrees C, while the glass fiber textile can withstand up to 1200 degrees C. The surface roughness of the textiles has been significantly reduced by screen printing a polyurethane interface layer on the polyester cotton fabric and a liquid polyimide on the glass fiber textile. A silver bottom electrode layer and a bespoke titanium dioxide electron transport layer formulated for each temperature range were then screen printed onto the planarized surfaces. The devices use lodine/lodide (I-3(-)/I-) as the liquid electrolyte and were sealed with a plastic PET/ITO, which also forms the counter electrodes. The printed cells have demonstrated photovoltaic (PV) power conversion efficiencies of 3.24% on polyester cotton and 4.04% on glass fiber textiles, in ambient conditions.

Besides, the highly delocalized frontier orbitals, that allow direct electron transfer through the ligand p orbitals, make these class of complexes promising candidates for photochemical devices as well as sensitizer for dye-sensitized solar cells. In this work, we investigated the electronic and geometric properties of Pd and Pt (CH3)(2)[M(dmit)(2)] complexes isolated on TiO2(101) surface by means of first-principles calculations using plane-wave basis sets and DFT calculation. Adsorption energies of metal complexes supported on a TiO2(101) surface are calculated for three different configurations, linked by the sulfur atom of S-thione, S-thiole-S-thiolate, and planar. The studies found that the most stable adsorption molecular configuration mode for the palladium(II) and platinum(II) complexes is the planar mode. TD-DFT molecular calculations revealed that the lowest energy transition in the ultraviolet visible near-infrared range mainly corresponds to the HOMO-LUMO excitation for the (CH3)(2)[M(dmit)(2)]complexes. Theoretical calculations of optical absorption spectra of (CH3)(2)[M(dmit)(2)] complexes adsorbed on the anatase (101) surface show that the interaction induces a slightly redshift of electronic absorption bands. Density of states for the metal complexes/TiO2(101) system revealed that the LUMO of the metal complexes lies at below the edge of the TiO2 conduction band. The adsorption of the (CH3)(2)[Pd(dmit)(2)] complex on the anatase (101) surface results in the emergence of new transitions below 1 eV that can be ascribed to the presence of a favorable overlap between the LUMO of the complex and the conduction band of the TiO2 semiconductor.",,,,"da Cruz, Antonio GB/J-2402-2013; Paes, Lilian Weitzel C/J-3056-2018","da Cruz, Antonio GB/0000-0002-5172-2527; Paes, Lilian Weitzel C/0000-0001-9027-0319",,,,,,,,,,,,1432-881X,1432-2234,,,,JUL,2019,138,7,,,,,,,88,10.1007/s00214-019-2474-6,,,,,,,,WOS:000472109300001,,,,,

One of the major issues with TiO2-based DSSCs is the recombination loss at the substrate-electrolyte interface due to the mesoporous nature of the TiO2 film. It was proposed earlier that introduction of a blocking layer at the substrate-TiO2 interface could reduce this recombination loss by preventing direct contact of the substrate and electrolyte. In this study, ZnO blocking layers (ZBLs) with different thicknesses were spin-coated onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass and the influence studied in comparison with a conventional TiO2 blocking layer (TBL) prepared using the same technique. The ZBL functions as an energy barrier at the FTO-electrolyte interface to prevent backtransfer of electrons to the electrolyte from the FTO. The blocking effect of the ZBL was verified by an enhancement of the fill factor (FF) and open-circuit photovoltage (V-oc) of the DSSC, leading to an improvement in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3.86% to 4.34% for the ZBL with optimum thickness of 120nm. The suppression of the dark current density revealed a reduction of charge recombination with increasing ZBL thickness. Further increase in the ZBL thickness resulted in reduced cell performance due to a drastic decrease of the short-circuit current density (J(sc)).

Conventionally, ZnO nanostructures used for gas-sensing have been usually prepared via chemical route, where the 3D/2D nanostructures are chemically synthesized and subsequently plated on an appropriate substrate. However, using pulsed laser ablation technique, the ZnO nanostructures are structurally designed and grown directly on a substrate using a two-step temperature-pressure seeding approach. This approach has been optimized to design various ZnO nanostructures by understanding the effect of substrate temperature in the 300-750 degrees C range under O-2 gas pressure from 10-mTorr to 10 Torr. Using a thin ZnO seed layer as template that is deposited first at substrate temperature of 300 degrees C at background oxygen pressure of 10 mTorr on Si(100), ZnO nanostructures, such as nanoworms, nanowalls, and nanorods (with secondary flower-like growth) were grown at substrate temperatures and oxygen background pressures of (550 degrees C and 2 Torr), (550 degrees C and 0.5 Torr), and (650 degrees C and 2 Torr), respectively. The morphology and the optical properties of ZnO nanostructures were examined by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM-EDX), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), and photoluminescence (PL). The PLD-grown ZnO nanostructures are single-crystals and are highly oriented in the c-axis. The vapor-solid (VS) model is proposed to be responsible for the growth of ZnO nanostructures by PLD process. Furthermore, the ZnO nanowall structure is a very promising nanostructure due to its very high surface-to-volume ratio. Although ZnO nanowalls have been grown by other methods for sensor application, to this date, only a very few ZnO nanowalls have been grown by PLD for this purpose. In this regard, ZnO nanowall structures are deposited by PLD on an Al2O3 test sensor and assessed for their responses to CO and ethanol gases at 50 ppm, where good responses were observed at 350 and 400 degrees C, respectively.

The printable electrolytes are prepared based on 3-methoxypropionitrile liquid electrolytes containing iodide/triiodide redox mediator, polyethylene oxide/polyvinylidene fluoride gelator, and titanium dioxide nanofillers. To obtain the optimal performance of the DSSCs, the composition of the printable electrolytes and the thickness of the photoelectrode are regulated. The results show that the polymers composition has little effect on the conversion efficiency of the QS-DSSCs under ambient-light conditions. However, the iodine concentration and the thickness of the titanium dioxide film are important parameters. The experimental results indicate that the printable electrolyte containing 0.01 M iodine, and a titanium dioxide photoelectrode with the thickness of 4 mu m main layer and 4 mu m scattering layer are the optimal condition to obtain high cell efficiencies. It also shows that the best QS-DSSCs have high recombination resistance and high incident photon to current efficiency values, which contribute, respectively, to the high open circuit voltage and the current density of the corresponding cells. Therefore, the cells can achieve efficiencies of 15.39% and 20.63% under 200 and 600 lx illuminance, respectively. These efficiencies are almost similar to the conversion efficiencies of the corresponding liquid-state DSSC. By applying this printable electrolyte to a sub-module cell, an energy conversion efficiency of 12.23% is achieved under 200 lx illuminance. The study of long-term stability shows that the efficiency of the QS-DSSC can retain 97% of its initial performance after 1000 h testing under 200 lx illuminance, exhibiting high stability of the cells.",,,,,"Liu, I-Ping/0000-0002-7380-4777",,,,,,,,,,,,1385-8947,1873-3212,,,,1-Jul,2019,367,,,,,,17,24,,10.1016/j.cej.2019.02.118,,,,,,,,WOS:000461380400003,,,,,

Optimized crystal structures, density of states (DOS) and band structure of these systems were calculated using Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package code. From this study, Al and Ga are found to play an important role in both the morphology and optical properties of the ZnO: Al and Ga doping can change the band gap and the Fermi level position in the ZnO.

The Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, relaxation time, electronic thermal conductivity and power factor were all analysed. The experimental and computational results all point in the same direction, indicating that the thermoelectric properties of ZnO change because the semiconductor ZnO transforms into metallic ZnO when doped with Al and Ga. This leads to ZnO showing different thermoelectric properties, particularly Ga-doped ZnO and (Al, Ga)-co doped ZnO: they provide a high electrical conductivity and power factor.

Meanwhile, aromatic ring fusion to a porphyrin core is an attractive option for highly efficient DSSCs because of its expanded pi-conjugation and resultant red-shifted absorption.

On the basis of field-emission scanning electron microscopy and ultraviolet (UV)-vis-near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy measurements on the ZnO NR photoelectrodes of varying lengths, it was observed that the dye adsorption and light-scattering properties of NRs are affected by their length. In addition, DSSCs were prepared using ZnO NRs of varying lengths. These DSSCs were examined via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency measurements, and solar simulations to measure their photovoltaic efficiencies, carrier lifetimes, and device characteristics in omnidirectional antireflection measurements. The highest photovoltaic efficiency between these DSSCs was 0.33%. Omnidirectional antireflection measurements were performed on DSSCs with different ZnO NR lengths, and it was observed that the smallest change in efficiency between angles of incidence of 0 degrees and 60 degrees was 23%.

Generally, solar activity of natural dyes stem from anthocyanin pigment. Carbonyl, carboxyl, and hydroxyl groups present in the anthocyanin molecule improve the adsorption ability of dye on TiO2 and therefore facilitate charge transfer. Here, for the first time, novel natural dyes extracted from St. Lucie cherry, yellow jasmine, and madder berries are reported to act as sensitizer in DSSCs. These novel natural dye extracts are prepared by dissolving related fruits in ethanol. The ingredient of the dyes is identified by FT-IR spectroscopy. Accordingly, FT-IR spectrum reveals that novel natural dye extracts exhibit all the characteristic peaks of anthocyanin pigment. Specifically, St. Lucie cherry consists of more distinct carbonyl group than other sources. Also, photoanodes composed of three TiO2 layers are prepared by using a spin-coating method. Then, they are immersed into natural dyes and analyzed by conducting UV-Vis spectroscopy. Compared with bare TiO2, natural dye-loaded photoanodes demonstrate far higher absorption ability in the visible region. After fabrication of devices with different novel natural dye sensitizers, current-voltage characteristics and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements are performed. The best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.19% is obtained by sensitization of St. Lucie cherry with an open-circuit voltage (V-oc) of 0.56 V, short-circuit current density (J(sc)) of 181 mu A cm(-2), and fill factor (FF) of 0.55. Furthermore, St. Lucie cherry-sensitized devices show the lowest charge transfer and highest recombination resistances.

The great advantages of inkjet printing are that the process is contactless, maskless and has a high material utilization rate, and good scalability, and compatibility of the roll-to-roll process.

As a result, the carrier lifetime is improved by one order of magnitude from 0.18 ms of pure CuSCN to 6.7 ms of CuSCN/Cu2O.

In a DSC, due to interfaces between the dye and the charge-transport materials, the interface electrostatics becomes a key factor determining the overall performance of the cell. Liquid-electrolyte-based DSCs suffer from low stability, electrolyte leakage, and, in some cases, electrode corrosion. Replacing liquid electrolyte with a solid semiconducting material leads to poor interfacial contacts, hence the interface electrostatics becomes one of the limiting factors. In this work, we present a drift-diffusion and density functional theory (DFT) study of solid-state DSCs to investigate the electrostatics at the TiO2/organic dye/Spiro-OMeTAD interface and its impact on the adsorbed dye energy levels, its absorption spectrum, and the related charge injection. In our three-dimensional drift-diffusion model, we solve a set of drift-diffusion equations coupled to Poisson equation for electrons, holes, doping impurities, and interface traps simultaneously. After that, we use first-principles DFT modeling of dye-sensitized interfaces in the presence of the calculated electric fields. We find that interface traps located below the conduction band edge of mesoporous TiO2 influence the accumulation of photogenerated holes and built-in electric field near the interface. The built-in electric field leads to change in the energetics at the dye/TiO2 interface, leading to poor charge injection from excited dye into TiO2. The simulations were carried out for different electronic trap densities in TiO2 and different doping levels in the Spiro-OMeTAD hole-transport layer.

Herein, using a hydrophobic donor-double-acceptor dye (denoted as BH4) sensitized NiO photocathode, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) can be produced efficiently by reducing O-2 with current density up to 600 mu A cm(-2) under 1 sun conditions (Xe lamp as sunlight simulator, lambda > 400 nm). The DSPECs maintain currents greater than 200 mu A cm(-2) at low overpotential (0.42 V vs. RHE) for 18 h with no decrease in the rate of H2O2 production in aqueous electrolyte. Moreover, the BH4 sensitized NiO photocathode was for the first time applied in an aprotic electrolyte for oxygen reduction. In the absence of a proton source, the one-electron reduction of O-2 generates stable, nucleophilic superoxide radicals that can then be synthetically utilized in the attack of an available electrophile, such as benzoyl chloride.

The fabrication of the CDOT-based dye sensitized solar cell and its performance characteristics are explored in depth. The fabricated dye sensitized solar cell performance in terms of efficiency, voltage, and current was evaluated using a standard illumination of air-mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5 G) having an irradiance of 100 mW/cm [2]. The photon-to-current conversion efficiency (eta) of only the carbon dot sensitized solar cell was 0.10% whereas the efficiency of the solar cell fabricated with a sensitizing dye made up of CDOT and N719 was 0.19%. As compared with the performance DSSCs fabricated with only 719 dye, it was observed that when CDOT was used in combination with N719 as sensitizing dye, the open circuit voltage increases yet the overall efficiency of the resulting solar cells decreases. It is clear from the result that CDOT could be used as a sensitizing dye in DSSCs. However, it is not very useful when used in combination with other sensitizing dyes due to energy transfer.

Efficient harnessing of solar energy using technologies such as the dye-sensitized solar cell could solve the energy problem which persistently plagues developing countries. Despite having a simple operational procedure and modest power conversion efficiency of 13.8%, the dye-sensitized solar cell consists of an expensive platinum counter electrode which makes commercial success futile. Thus, this review intends to establish the progress researchers have attained in the development of sulphide based counter electrodes as alternatives to platinum, thereby lowering cost of production. Metallic sulphides are good electrocatalysts and cheap, hence, they possess the necessary requirements for effective functional counter electrodes. Furthermore, ternary metallic sulphides are known to exhibit higher efficiencies stemming from the synergistic effect produced by the co-existence of two metal ions in a crystal structure, which is believed to induce greater catalytic capability. Incorporation of metallic sulphides with carbon materials, which are exceptional electrical conductors, could potentially produce more efficient counter electrodes. In that regard, this review seeks to establish the effect recently developed composite counter electrodes comprising metallic sulphides and carbon-based materials have induced on the functionality of the counter electrode (CE).",,,,"; Meyer, Edson/C-8127-2018; Taziwa, Raymond/V-7998-2018","Bede, Asanda/0000-0001-9115-7211; Zingwe, Nyengerai Hillary/0000-0002-3775-9016; Meyer, Edson/0000-0002-9912-311X; Taziwa, Raymond/0000-0002-5374-6223",,,,,,,,,,,,1996-1944,,,,,2-Jun,2019,12,12,,,,,,,1980,10.3390/ma12121980,,,,,,,,WOS:000473759400099,31226735,,,,

The effects of the anodization on the physical features of the VOTNs, such as nanotube diameter, wall thickness, and nanotube length, were studied in detail. The Ti mesh is an ideal candidate for DSSC substrates due to its highly bending ability under external force. The photo-to-electric conversion efficiency (eta) of the mesh-VOTN-based DSSCs is dependent on the TiO2 nanotube length, which can achieve an efficiency of 2.66% at 100 mW cm(-2) under AM 1.5 simulated full light when the nanotube length is similar to 18 mu m. The DSSC performance dependence on the Ti mesh geometry and the incident angle of the illuminated light were characterized by current density vs voltage (I-V) measurements. The DSSC efficiency is also in close relation to the incident angle of the incoming light, which slowly decreases as the incident angle increases from 0 to 90 degrees but does not decrease much even under 30 degrees bending.

Both structural and electronic properties were found to be correlating with the type of the binding atom in the CNS ligand (isomerization differs by 4-13 kcal.mol(-1)). The N-bonding of CNS ligands is energetically favored. It was also found that the low spin (LS) state is the ground state for both Ru(II) and Co(III) complexes regardless of the CNS arrangement. The other complexes are the high-spin (HS) ground-state ones with the only exception of the S-bonded CNS isomer of the Fe(III) complex. The dependencies of energy differences between the HS and LS states versus C demonstrated stabilization of the HS state with an increasing amount of the exact exchange admixture (C) for iron and cobalt complexes. An opposite behavior was observed for ruthenium complexes. The best match in harmonic vibrational frequencies between the experimental and calculated values has been reached at C = 0.15 for all the complexes. The absorption profile of the Fe(II) complex with the alternatively bonded CNS ligands strongly depends on the angle between them.

An increase of 14% in cell efficiency was achieved by introducing 10 wt% NTs. In this configuration, high dye loading is ensured and substantial improvement in electron transport efficiency is achieved by a more effective stack of the particles. Moreover, a 21 wt% rutile content is beneficial to the overall solar energy conversion by prompting highly efficient electron migration from the rutile conduction band to anatase trapping sites. When 20-100% NTs are incorporated in the structure, the photocurrent and thus the cell efficiency decrease progressively. The diminution of photocurrent is associated with a lesser amount of adsorbed dye, owing to the small surface area of titanium (IV) oxide films with high NT content.

The scattering centre serves to extend the optical path length and improve the long-wavelength response of the DSC. This study aims to develop an optimum structure of micron-size SiO2 core and TiO2 nanoshell structure as light scattering centre for the photoelectrode film of DSC. MATLAB simulation of extinction efficiency based on Mie scattering theory estimated that the optimum size of light scatterer scattering size is in the range of 150-250 nm with shell thickness of about 10-45 nm. Integration of 15% SiO2-TiO2 core-shell (STCS) into the upper layer of double layers printed photoelectrode resulted in the highest short circuit current. Although the photoelectrode film embedded with STCS structure seems to have a significant reduction in the amount of anchored dye due to its low surface area, but its IPCE analysis shows better photocurrent response especially in the wavelength range of 400-650 nm. The enhancement is attributed to the effective light scattering of the STCS structure which is capable of extending the travel distance of the incidence photon thus increasing the amount of photon captured by the sensitized dye molecules. Besides, the embedded STCS structures also help in increasing the recombination resistance, reducing rate of electron recombination, hence improving the electron lifetime.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2352-4928,,,,,JUN,2019,19,,,,,,220,229,,10.1016/j.mtcomm.2019.01.012,,,,,,,,WOS:000470091100028,,,,,

Herein by several series of Monte Carlo simulations employing spherical nanoparticle molecular supports, we identify conditions that result in the largest yield for forming specific redox states of electrocatalysts. In general, the yield for electrocatalyst oxidation/reduction increased as the self-exchange electron-transfer time constant decreased and/or the recombination time constant increased. When the number of electrocatalysts increased to more than one per nanoparticle, yields for oxidation/reduction of electrocatalysts decreased because oxidative/reductive equivalents were diluted among the larger number of electrocatalysts. As the light intensity increased the yield for oxidation/reduction of electrocatalysts increased both in absolute number and yield per absorbed photon. However, at extreme photon fluences the yield per absorbed photon decreased due to significantly faster recombination which is clear from the equal-concentration second-order nature of the recombination reaction in the number of oxidized/reduced molecules per nanoparticle. Results obtained using electrocatalysts that only required a single oxidation/reduction event for turnover were within error the same irrespective of whether optical excitation was simulated to occur as an initial pulse, to mimic pulsed-laser spectroscopic measurements, or with repeated photoexcitation events, to mimic conditions of solar illumination. However, when electrocatalysts required multiple oxidations/reductions for turnover the intensity of pulsed light required to obtain the same electrocatalyst turnover yield that was observed using repeated photoexcitation depended greatly on the electron-transfer time constants. In addition, at solar-relevant fluences the equal-concentration second-order kinetic process for recombination exhibited a firstorder dependence on the number of nanoparticles that contained an oxidized/reduced molecule. The rate of electrocatalyst turnover after two redox events was also determined to have a first-order dependence on the concentration of oxidized/reduced molecules over most of the time that oxidized/reduced molecules were present. Collectively the solar-simulated data showed that even under the assumption of ideal kinetic processes and molecular and semiconductor densities of states, the observed kinetic behavior can be complex and change as a function of time and fluence. These observations suggest that results from pulsed-laser spectroscopic measurements are not always accurate predictors of the expected behavior of sunlight-illuminated dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells that drive multiple-charge-transfer reactions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2398-4902,,,,,1-Jun,2019,3,6,,,,,1573,1587,,10.1039/c9se00009g,,,,,,,,WOS:000469258600020,,,,,

The morphology of Ni-Co-S films can be controlled through adjusting the molar ratio of Ni and Co ions in the electroplating solution. Ni-Co-S films can be directly applied as low-cost CEs of DSCs. The results demonstrate that Ni-Co-S CEs exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance for I-3(-) reduction, owing to the synergistic effect and amorphous structure of Ni-Co-S films. Particularly, the DSC based on Ni-Co-S CE with the optimized Ni/Co ratio has achieved the high PCE of 8.18%, which is larger than that of the DSC with platinum (Pt) CE (6.33%).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0025-5408,1873-4227,,,,JUN,2019,114,,,,,,10,17,,10.1016/j.materresbull.2019.01.025,,,,,,,,WOS:000466617400002,,,,,

In the present study, we report developing the combustion-activated pyrolysis route of horizontal ultrasonic spray pyrolysis deposition (HUSPD) as a novel strategy to form highly transparent conducting fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) films. Compared to the basic route, the combustion-activated FTO films showed an attractive transparent conducting performance (figure of merit of 5.34 x 10(-2) Omega(-1)) with a highly improved optical transparency (90.1%) due to the formation of a smooth and dense film structure to reduce light scattering on the surface, and a decrease of oxygen vacancies to broaden the optical bandgap, all of which yielded an excellent performance as compared to the previously reported studies on the FTO films. Moreover, when the combustion-activated FTO films were used as TCOs of electrochromic devices and dye-sensitized solar cells, they acquired multifunctional effects of (a) an efficient electron transfer by (200) preferred orientations of the FTO; (b) a relaxed light scattering on the interface due to smooth and dense surface morphology of the FTO films; and (c) a broad optical bandgap by decreased oxygen vacancies, resulting in an impressive improvement of both electrochromic and photovoltaic performances.

The images of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicate the temperature-dependent evolution of structures and morphologies of the samples. Considering the efficient morphology of Cu7S4/CuS(synthesized at 210 degrees C) with the porous hollow spherical structure, we speculate it should have good photoelectric properties, such as wide UV-vis absorption spectra, and its performance should be enhanced with further treatment like being encapsulated with nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide.

Two metal selenides with different morphologies, Co0.85Se, which has a foliate structure like the structure of graphene, and Ni0.85Se, which has uniform nanoparticle, were synthesized by a facile one-step hydrothermal method. The proposed BQDSSCs were then constructed using the TiO2 photoanode, polyvinylidene fluoride gel electrolyte, and Co0.85Se or Ni0.85Se as the counter electrode (CE) electrocatalysts. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and Tafel polarization measurements were performed to investigate the electrochemical behavior of the Co0.85Se, Ni0.85Se, and Pt CEs. The results showed that the graphene-like Co0.85Se material exhibited better operational stability, greater charge-transfer ability, and higher electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of I-(3) over bar than the Ni0.85Se nanoparticles. Furthermore, for the BQDSSCs, Co-0.(85) Se yielded the highest power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 8.33% and 4.79% under front and rear irradiations, respectively, in comparison with the front and rear efficiencies of 7.44% and 4.05% for Pt and 7.23% and 4.16% for Ni0.85Se CEs, respectively. The BQDSSC device based on the Co0.85Se CE exhibited good long-term stability with only a 5% drop in power conversion efficiency after 1000 h of one-sun soaking.

The structure, light absorption, surface texturing, and morphology characterizations have established the strong interaction between ZnO, carbon nanotubes, and graphene oxide components because of the presence of well-dispersed ZnO nanorods with an aspect ratio of 3.4 (L x D = 75 x 22 nm). The assembled dye-sensitized solar cell of a ZnO/CNT-GO photoanode exhibited a superior performance, with a power conversion efficiency of 7.73%, surpassing those of its ZnO/CNT (5.07%) and ZnO/GO (3.96%) counterparts. Although CNT-GO exhibited a higher incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) and lower photoluminescence (PL) intensity than those of the ZnO/CNT-GO composite, it presented a lower conversion efficiency of 5.60%. This can be attributed to the presence of structural defects at the CNT/GO interface, which resulted in lower electronic conductivity (0.25 x 10(-3) Omega(-1) cm(-1) vs. 0.8 x 10(-3) Omega(-1) cm(-1) for ZnO/CNT-GO) and optical performance. The ZnO/CNT-GO composite showed a superior I-SC value of 17.6 mA/cm(2) but a lower V-oc value of 0.63 V in comparison to those of its ZnO/GO analog (3.9 mA/cm(2), 0.8 V); it also showed a manifested increase in surface area and pore radius values (227.5 m(2)/g, 58.9 angstrom) toward the dye absorption. The electrochemical capacitance performance obtained via using charge-discharge and impedance spectroscopy revealed an excellent specific capacitance in the order of ZnO/CNT-G (290 F/g) > CNT-G (275 F/g) > ZnO/G (230 F/g) > ZnO/CNT (183 F/g) at 1.0 A g(-1).

In order to maximize the recycling of materials, extend the service life of DSC, and greatly reduce the cost of device, the tolerance of the regeneration cycle of DSC performance should be studied. This paper adopts the continuous repeated electric erasure/re-sensitization (EERS) dye molecules on surface of the TiO2 film to study the tolerance of the regeneration cycle of DSC performance. The effect of the multiple EERS process on DSC photoelectric properties, TiO2 surface states, electron transfer and transport properties are studied in depth. The result shows that after being erased and re-sensitized for the first two times, the performance parameters remain almost unchanged. However, J(sc) declines, V-oc declines slightly and FF is almost unchanged after the subsequent continuous operation with EERS. Finally, DSC efficiency remains around 90.98% after being erased and re-sensitized for six times. The major cause of efficiency decline is the declining J(sc) and V-oc caused by more defects on the TiO2 film surface due to EERS process. The research results predict that the DSC performance can be regenerated multiple times and service life of device can increase dramatically. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Significant progress has been made in this area, but many challenges remain in terms of stability, synthetic complexity, and versatility. We report here a new anchoring strategy based on self assembled bilayers. This strategy takes advantage of noncovalent interactions between long alkyl chains chemically bound to a metal-oxide electrode surface and long alkyl chains on the molecule being anchored.

Based on the TNTAs with ultra-long crystals, we further developed an electronically heterogeneous hierarchical architecture for dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) application. In this crafted structure, the columnar single crystals on the nanotube walls provide well-aligned pathways with high electron mobility for rapid electron transport, while a mesoporous TiO2 network welded on the nanotube walls provides sufficient surface area for dye loading. The significant mismatch in electron mobility between the TNTA scaffold and mesoporous TiO2 network drains the electrons from the TiO2 network to the TNTAs, enabling high charge collection efficiency exceeding 90% within a approximate to 30 m film.

In this work is reported for the first time that molecularly imprinted polypyrrole (MIP-PPy) can help to overcome these challenges. Different template molecules such as 2-aminoacetic acid (Glycine) and L-2-aminopropionic acid (L-Alanine) are considered during the electropolymerization process in order to verify the application of MIP-PPy as CE. The use of low concentration of Glycine leads to a MIP-PPy film exhibiting higher catalytic activity and electrochemical properties on triiodide reduction than the non-imprinted polypyrrole (NIP-PPy) one. Gel-state DSSCs based on MIP materials were prepared and tested and the optimized MIP-PPy CE with Glycine as template showed an increase of around 20% of the power conversion efficiency and a reduction of 50% of the charge transfer resistance in comparison with the cells based on NIP-PPy. These results demonstrate the possibility to enhance the catalytic properties of PPy CE without adding any other materials or considerable modifications of the production process but simply increasing the electrode selectivity.

Here, we report a porphyrin-based dye (SM85) conjugated to the planar strong electron donor, indolizine, designed to extend absorption further into the NIR region by inducing pi-pi interactions such as head-to-tail dye aggregation. The optoelectronic consequences of indolizine incorporation in SM85 include raising the ground-state oxidation potential and broadening and red-shifting ultraviolet-visible-NIR absorptions, along with increased molar absorptivity when compared to the dye SM315. Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations confirm the push-pull character of SM85, which features an overlap of frontier occupied and unoccupied orbitals. Steady-state spectrophotometric analyses reveal the presence of solution aggregates via absorption and emission spectroscopies. Aggregate modes were probed by DFT and TD-DFT analyses, and plausible models are presented. SM85-based DSC devices demonstrate a 5.7% power conversion efficiency (PCE) at full sun (7.4% PCE at 10% sun) with an exceptional improvement to the incident photon-to-current conversion onset at similar to 850 nm.

SnO2/ZnO nanocomposites can be a good choice for application in DSSCs due to their favorable optical and electrical properties. In this paper, we prepare SnO2/ZnO nanocomposites employing an electrochemical cell, which uses two Sn and Zn scarifying electrodes simultaneously. For this purpose, we designed a voltage source that is capable of applying the voltage between the two electrodes with the desired duration. The XRD results indicate that tin oxide tetragonal phase and zinc oxide hexagonal phase are formed separately. On the other hand, the synthesized samples morphology is affiliated with the applied frequency and duty cycle. The dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) fabricated from differently prepared samples show dissimilar characteristics. Our best solar cell demonstrated a 150% growth of efficiency in comparison with the cells prepared from pure SnO2 nanoparticles. The dye-loading and OCVD results clearly illustrate that the presence of zinc oxide structures among SnO2 nanoparticles can considerably influence the dye adsorption and carriers' lifetime and thus improve the photovoltaic characteristics. In order to show the feasibility of our method, we also fabricate a DSSC by using separately prepared SnO2 and ZnO nanoparticles by electrochemical dissolution method and mix them in the paste preparation step. The J-V characteristics and dye-loading analysis indicate the superiority of the dual anodic dissolution method. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The compact layer decreases the recombination of electrons extracted through the FTO layer with I-3(-) around the maximum power point. Furthermore, the short-circuit photocurrent was improved, which previously has been attributed to the improved light transmittance and/or better contact between TiO2 and FTO. Here, we demonstrate that the compact TiO2 layer has another beneficial effect: it blocks the reaction between charge carriers in the FTO and photogenerated diiodide radical species (I-2(-center dot)).

As a matter of fact, recombination phenomena at the NiO/electrolyte interface heavily limit both photovoltage and photocurrent. Different approaches have been adopted to minimize such an unwanted process: these range from the pretreatment of the electrode surface with NaOH to the employment of passivating organic molecules (e.g. CDCA) in the sensitizing solution and/or in the electrolyte solution. The present contribution describes the implementation of the addition of zirconia (ZrO2) nanoparticles in nanostructured NiO films as anti-recombination agent in p-DSCs due to the electro-inactivity of ZrO2. ZrO2 nanoparticles with diameter, phi, of 20 nm, and NiO nanoparticles with phi < 50 nm were dispersed together in the paste precursor for screen-printing. Different compositions of the mixture of NiO and ZrO2 nanoparticles were considered. From the combined analysis of the electrochemical and photoelectrochemical properties of different nanocomposites it was concluded that the molar ratio ZrO2/NiO had the optimal range of 2%-5% for realizing photocathodes more efficacious than sole nanostructured NiO. Among the nanocomposite photoelectrodes the one obtained from the inclusion of 2% of ZrO2 nanoparticles produced the better photoelectrochemical performance being the short-circuit current density J(SC) = 2.037 mA/cm(2) and the overall efficiency eta = 0.088% when P1 is the sensitizer. These results show an increase up to 40% compared to the un-modified NiO electrode. The unexpectedly low efficiency of electrode with molar ratio of zirconia in nickel oxide of 5% was associated to an insufficient dye-loading on NiO, in combination to the increase of the percentage of the photoelectrochemically inert ZrO2 additive. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data of the complete device under illumination confirmed that the improvement is mainly due to an increase of the recombination resistance, R-rec, ongoing from sole nanostructured NiO (R-rec = 56.3 Omega) to the electrode obtained from the nanocomposite with molar ratio ZrO2/NiO = 0.02 (R-rec = 70.3 Omega).

The structure and properties of electrospun PVDF membranes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), thermogravimetric (TG), and mechanical testing. The results indicate that the electrospun PVDF membrane has a three-dimensional network structure with extremely high porosity, which not only acts as a barrier to prevent electrolyte leakage but also provides a channel for the transmission of ions in the electrolyte, thereby effectively guaranteeing the high photoelectric conversion efficiency of the cells. The membrane was observed to withstand the conditions of hot-press (110 degrees C), and exhibited good thermal stability and mechanical strength, which are critical for the long-term stability and safety of the cells. The photovoltaic characteristics and stabilities of QS-DSSCs were compared with DSSCs based on an ionic liquid electrolyte (L-DSSC). QS-DSSCs with an 80 mu m thick nanofiber electrolyte membrane showed a conversion efficiency of 8.63%, whereas an identical cell based on the corresponding ionic liquid electrolyte showed an efficiency of 9.30%. The stability test showed that, under indoor and outdoor conditions, after 390 h, the L-DSSCs failed. Meanwhile, the QS-DSSCs also maintained 84% and 77% of the original efficiency. The results show that, compared to the liquid electrolyte, the design of the quasi-solid electrolytes based on electrospun PVDF nanofiber membrane not only demonstrates the high conversion efficiency of DSSCs but also enhances the stability of the DSSCs, which provides the possibility for the fabrication of solar cells with higher efficiency and stability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2079-4991,,,,,MAY,2019,9,5,,,,,,,783,10.3390/nano9050783,,,,,,,,WOS:000479007900125,31121912,,,,

In the ground state, the electrons of the push part appear to be the least bound because they have the highest probabilities of ionization. In the excited state, the ionized atoms are essentially positioned in the pushing part and some neighboring atoms of the bridge. In the electronic transition, the active atoms are located in the pi-conjugated part but only on the side adjacent to the acceptor group.

According to the optical results, the incorporation of K+ ions as the donors into ZnO lattice substantially modulated the bandgap structure of ZnO nanorods leading to formation of new emission centers. This in turn resulted in the redshift of the ultraviolet emission peaks. The optical band gap reduces from 3.26eV for the undoped ZnO to 3.21eV for K (10 wt%)-doped ZnO nanorods.

Different methods have been used to enhance its photocatalytic activity by creating band gap states through the introduction of oxygen vacancies, hydrogen impurities, or the adorption of phthalocyanines, which are usually employed as organic dyes in dye-sensitized solar cells. Predicting how these interactions affect the electronic structure of anatase requires an efficient and robust theory. In order to document the efficiency and accuracy of commonly used approaches we have considered two widely used implementations of density functional theory (DFT), namely the all-electron linear combination of atomic orbitals (AE-LCAO) and the pseudo-potential plane waves (PP-PW) approaches, to calculate the properties of the stoichiometric and defective anatase TiO2 (101) surface. Hybrid functionals, and in particular HSE, lead to a computed band gap in agreement with that measured by using UV adsorption spectroscopy. When using PBE+U, the gap is underestimated by 20 % but the computed position of defect induced gap states relative to the conduction band minimum (CBM) are found to be in good agreement with those calculated using hybrid functionals. These results allow us to conclude that hybrid functionals based on the use of AE-LCAO provide an efficient and robust approach for predicting trends in the band gap and the position of gap states in large model systems. We extend this analysis to surface adsorption and use the AE-LCAO approach with the hybrid functional HSED3 to study the adsorption of the phthalocyanine H2Pc on anatase (101). Our results suggest that H2Pc prefers to be adsorbed on the surface Ti-5c rows of anatase (101), in agreement with that seen in recent STM experiments on rutile (110).",,,,"Todorovic, Milica/S-7226-2019; Perez, Ruben/F-1849-2010","Todorovic, Milica/0000-0003-0028-0105; Perez, Ruben/0000-0001-5896-541X",,,,,,,,,,,,2296-2646,,,,,16-Apr,2019,7,,,,,,,,220,10.3389/fchem.2019.00220,,,,,,,,WOS:000464566800001,31106189,,,,

This study presents the utilization of raw cellulose (RC) and cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) extracted from the green algae Cladophora rupestris as precursors for carbon nanodots (CNDs) and its potential use as photosensitizer in solar cell. The results of the hydrothermal treatment of the celluloses afforded spherical CNDs with average dimension of 5.79 +/- 1.60 nm (TEM) and having crystalline property (d-spacing of 0.253 +/- 0.050 nm) indicating graphitic nature. The size distribution and the ease of the CND formation have been shown to be influenced by the size and morphology of the cellulose precursor. The nanometer-sized crystalline CNCs afforded higher CND yield (54.6 +/- 2.71%) compared to the micrometer-sized amorphous RC (37.2 +/- 2.76% CND yield). However the size polydispersity of the latter was observed to be narrower at 10.0 +/- 3.74 nm (AFM) compared to the former (76.9 +/- 73.1 nm; AFM) attributed to clustering or aggregation aided by the presence of hydrophilic functional groups. Indeed, the FT-IR and TOF-SIMs analyses of the CNDs confirmed the presence of hydroxyls, oxides, and carbonyl functional groups that can facilitate the clustering. The CNDs exhibit photoluminescence upon UV irradiation and optical characterization using UV-Vis and Fluorescence Spectroscopy supported the structural and functional group analysis of carbon nanodots.

The as-prepared CNF/TiO2/Au is characterized by conductive carbon nanofiber (CNF) core, uniform TiO2 outer shell assembled by upright nanorods, and surface modification with well-dispersed Au nanoparticles.

Structural investigation revealed that the interested medium in this work employed for the synthesis of TiO2 produced different types of dual morphologies such as nanospheres with nanoparticles (NSNP), microsphere decorated with nanoparticles (mu SNP) and nanoparticles with stone like features (NPS). UV vis and DRS results indicated the ability of the materials to assist with diffused reflectance and optical absorption of the screen printed photoanodes.

The high intense Eg anatase mode of Raman spectrum was simulated using a phonon confinement model and its normalized spectra are compared with an experimental data. The resultant performances in the DSSCs were not indicative by the material properties; so, the charge transfer resistance (R-ct) and recombination properties of the photoanode were investigated. These results showed that the Nyquist plot of NSNP possesses the smallest diameter, which reveals that the device based on NSNP offers the lowest R-ct value that accounts for the higher conversion efficiencies when compared with the DSSC device based on photoanodes mu SNP and NSP. It can be concluded that the improved power conversion efficiency shown by photoanode fabricated using NSNP has the dual role of optimum surface area for dye loading and light scattering centres.

The results show that the cell sensitized by PH2 with co-adsorption of chenodeoxycholic acid obtains a high power conversion efficiency, even higher than that of the cell based on N719. Thus, an effective way to increase the photovoltage and efficiency of the DSSCs has been developed by introducing the EIMW into the organic dyes due to the effective inhibition of dye aggregation and charge recombination.

Different electron withdrawing groups and pi-linkers are used to understand their role in tuning the NLO properties. The NLO properties of the molecules are analyzed in gas phase and in different solvent medium through the dipole moment, static polarizability, first and second hyperpolarizabilities. Efficiency of the molecules are studied through HOMO-LUMO gap, frontier molecular orbitals, light harvesting efficiency, ionization potential, electron affinity and reorganization energy for hole and electron. All the dyes show maximum absorption wavelength in the visible region. The computed absorption spectra are well correlated with the HOMO-LUMO gaps of the molecules. The HOMO-LUMO gaps of all the dyes are found to be small, which lead to large NLO response. Results indicate that hyperpolarizability increases with increasing strength of the electron withdrawing group. In addition to the study of nonlinear optical property, we also calculate relevant parameters related to photovoltaic cells for two designed dyes which emerge suitable for this purpose. Photovoltaic parameters such as electron injection efficiency, exciton binding energy, and open circuit photovoltage are evaluated for dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC) applications. This study shows that alkyne pi-linkers are better than the alkene pi-linkers for desired applications. Overall, this study highlights the optical and photovoltaic nature of the dyes and reveals the influence of different pi-linkers and electron acceptors in designing new materials for NLO and DSSC applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2365-6549,,,,,9-Apr,2019,4,13,,,,,3697,3705,,10.1002/slct.201803992,,,,,,,,WOS:000464282100011,,,,,

By using typical molecular Spiro-OMeTAD as an example, we herein introduced a hydrophobic polymeric poly(4-vinylpyridine) (P4VP) component to substantially reduce the undesired pinholes during device fabrication and operation. It leads to a significant improvement of the long-term stability of devices, which kept 80% of their original PCE for over 6000 h in ambient air and the promotion of light stability. In addition, P4VP can saturate uncoordinated Pb sites in perovskite crystals, resulting in improved device performance (certified PCE of 20.6%) with negligible hysteresis.

The optimized geometries indicate that these T shaped dyes show non-planar conformations, which are helpful in suppressing the dose intermolecular pi-pi aggregation in device and enhancing thermal stability.

Conversely, in protic solvents, in which solvent molecules bind stronger than p-ER with TiO2, the dye molecules adsorb onto the solvent shell around the particle but not directly to the TiO2 surface. In addition, a portion of the p-ER molecules form hydrogen bonds with the protic solvent molecules. The two different adsorption models reproduce the adsorption isotherms detected by SHS. Specifically, the p-ER molecules adsorb with a smaller free energy change and a larger density in protic solvents than in aprotic solvents.

A DFT study,INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Herein, the electronic structures and absorption spectra of a series of transition-metal-substituted polyoxometalates (TMSPs) were systematically investigated to screen promising candidates for the POM/TiO2 nanocomposite film used in DSSCs using the density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) methods. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) gaps (H-L gaps) of the studied TMSPs were remarkably influenced by the substituted transition metals in different periods. Specifically, the H-L gaps increase as the atomic number of the substituted transition metals increases in the same period such as Mn4+ < Fe2+ < Co2+ < Ni2+ (the fourth row) and Re6+ < Os6+ (the sixth row). Considering that the LUMO energy levels of all the studied TMSPs were higher than the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 (-4.00 eV), the TMSPs could quickly transport the photoinduced electrons as long as the LUMO energy levels of the used dyes were higher than those of the TMSPs. SiW11X4- (X = Mn6+, Ru6+ and Os6+) may perform well in DSSCs using the metal-free organic dye D149 due to the proper LUMO energy levels between the CB of TiO2 and the LUMO energy of D149 (-2.41 eV). The absorption spectra of SiW11X4- (X = Mn6+, Ru6+ and Os6+) exhibit broad absorptions in the UV-vis region that are more conducive to extend the range of light captured; this contributes to enhancing the photo-to-electric conversion efficiency. Moreover, the absorption of SiW11Mn4- red-shifts when compared with that of SiW11X4- (X = Ru6+ and Os6+), which results from the smallest H-L gap; this indicates that SiW11Mn4- will be a promising high-performance material-modified photoanode.
