Here, it is shown that several different types of ionic defects can be simultaneously passivated by simple inorganic binary alkaline halide salts with their cations and anions. Compared to previous literature reports, this work demonstrates a promising passivation technology for perovskite solar cells. The efficient defect passivation significantly suppresses the recombination at the SnO2/perovskite interface, contributing to an increase in the open-circuit voltage, the fast response of steady-state efficiency, and the elimination of hysteresis. By this strong leveraging of multiple-element passivation, low-temperature-processed, planar-structured perovskite solar cells of 20.5% efficiencies, having negligible hysteresis, are obtained. Moreover, this defect-passivation enhances the stability of solar cells with efficiency beyond 20%, retaining 90% of their initial performance after 30 d.

As realizing higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the solar cell is still the most crucial task, a great number of schemes were proposed to minimize the carrier loss by optimizing the electrical properties of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we focus on another significant aspect that is to minimize the light loss by using an antireflection coating (ARC) component to gain a high PCE for PSC devices. In our scheme, silica nanosphere based ARCs are employed to CH3NH3PbI3 PSCs for enhancing the device efficiency. SiO2 nanosphere based ARCs were grown by spin-coating of an aged silica sol. The microstructure and the thickness of the SiO2 nanosphere based ARC were controlled by changing the spin-coating speed from 400 to 4000 rpm. The effect of SiO2 nanosphere based ARCs on the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells is systematically investigated. The optimized SiO2 nanosphere ARC coating on cleaned glass substrate exhibited a maximum transmittance of 96.1% at lambda = 550 rim wavelength, and averagely increased the transmittance by about 3.8% in a broadband of 400-800 nm. The optimized antireflection coating strongly suppressed broadband and wide-angle reflectance in typical PSC solar cells, significantly enhancing the omnidirectional photovoltaic (PV) performance of PSCs. As a result, the power conversion efficiency was improved from 14.81% for reference device without SiO2 nanospheres to 15.82% for the PSC device with the optimized ARC.

Near-infrared-to-visible upconversion, in particular, shows promise in sub-bandgap sensitization of silicon and other optoelectronic materials, resulting in potential applications ranging from photovoltaics that exceed the Shockley-Queisser limit to infrared imaging. A feasible mechanism for near-infraredto- visible upconversion is triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) sensitized by colloidal nanocrystals (NCs). Here, the long lifetime of spin-triplet excitons in the organic materials that undergo TTA makes upconversion possible under incoherent excitation at relatively low photon fluxes. Since this process relies on optically inactive triplet states, semiconductor NCs are utilized as efficient spin mixers, absorbing the incident light and sensitizing the triplet states of the TTA material. The state-of-the-art system uses rubrene with a triplet energy of 1.14 eV as the TTA medium, and thus allows upconversion of light with photon energies above similar to 1.1 eV.

In this paper, we propose a fast, simple, two-step methodmediator extraction treatment (MET)for the preparation of a high-quality perovskite film. In MET, a pre-deposited PbI2-DMSO complex film is converted into a peculiar PbI2 film with a porous morphology and unusual crystallographic orientation via the removal of DMSO. PbI2 could be completely converted into MAPbI(3) by a fast reaction with MAI molecules. We demonstrate that this MET process in MAPbI(3)-based PSCs can achieve 18.8% of the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) using spin-coating, and 18.3% of the maximum PCE using slot-die coating with a uniform distribution in a 10 x10 cm(2) substrate at a laboratory scale.

In this work, we have combined gamma-aminobutyric acid iodide (GABAI) and CH3NH3I (MAI) as a mixed amine source in a precursor solution to fabricate a mixed-cation perovskite (GABA)(x)MA(1-x)PbI(3). As a result, high quality (GABA)(x)MA(1-x)PbI(3) crystals were synthesized and showed better pore-filling and more complete contact with the TiO2 scaffold, enhancing the power conversion efficiency from 15.08 to 18.31% with respect to the controlled MAPbI(3) solar cells. Importantly, the devices that contained GABA(+) also showed much higher stability when compared to the reference MAPbI(3) devices. This new chemical modification design, using bifunctional mixed cations in organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites, provides an efficient approach for improving both the performance and stability simultaneously.",,,,,"zhang, shufang/0000-0003-0556-4078",,,,,,,,,,,,2050-7488,2050-7496,,,,14-Jul,2018,6,26,,,,,12370,12379,,10.1039/c8ta00948a,,,,,,,,WOS:000437469300019,,,,,

However, the absorption intensity and power conversion efficiency of perovskite cells decreased with the increase in size of Ag nanoparticles.

Now, an approach to prepare smooth and large 2D antimonene with uniform layers that uses a pregrinding and subsequent sonication-assisted liquid-phase exfoliation process has been established. Mortar pregrinding provides a shear force along the layer surfaces, forming large, thin antimony plates, which can then easily be exfoliated into smooth, large antimonene, avoiding long sonication times and antimonene destruction.

In agreement with theoretical calculations predicting that Cu doping results in acceptor energy levels closer to the valence band maximum compared to gap states of nickel vacancies in undoped NiO, an increase in the conductivity in Cu:NiO films compared to NiO is observed. Cu in Cu:NiO can be found in both Cu+ and Cu2+ states, and the substitution of Ni2+ with Cu+ contributes to both increased carrier concentration and carrier mobility. In addition, the films exhibit increased work function, which together with the conductivity increase, enables improved charge transfer and extraction.

The current efficiency is enhanced by 1 order of magnitude as LEDs, and meanwhile the power conversion efficiency increases from 14.49% to 17.10% as SCs, compared to the reference device without QDs.

Herein, we highlight these, seldom reported, challenges with PCBM. Furthermore, we investigate the potential of nonfullerene indacenodithiophene (IDT)-based molecules by employing a commercially available variant, 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylpheny1)-dithieno[2,3-d:2',3'-d']-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b'] dithiophene (ITIC), as a PCBM replacement in ambient-processed PeSCs.

Although similar power-conversion efficiencies are achieved with both types of ETL in a simple device structure fabricated by spin-coating, the nanofibriller morphology of ITIC compared to the aggregated morphology of PCBM films enables improved mechanical integrity and stability of ITIC devices. Upon slot-die coating, the aggregation of PCBM is exacerbated, leading to significantly lower power-conversion efficiency of devices than spin-coated PCBM as well as slot-diecoated ITIC devices. Our results clearly indicate that IDT-based molecules have great potential as an ETL in PeSCs, offering superior properties and upscaling compatibility than PCBM.

Single-phase materials are easily obtained by means of a mild solution chemistry method performed at room temperature.

The optical band gaps displayed by these materials (1.9-3.2 eV) allow their classification as semiconductors. Additionally, the three halides display photoluminescence with emission in the visible range. The behavior of [Dim](2)[Bi2I10] is particularly interesting, as it shows an optical band gap of 1.9 eV, a broad band photoluminescence emission, and a relatively emission lifetime of 190 ns. Moreover, the iodide and bromide compounds also exhibit a reversible solid state thermochromism, being the first example of a bromobismuthate with this property. The diimidazolium cations play an important structural role by stabilizing the crystal structure and balancing the charges of the [Bi2X10](4-) dimers.

In particular, a nanostructured interface (e.g., a core shell nanowire) between two semiconductors leads to a short charge separation distance, such that photoexcited charge carriers can be more quickly and efficiently collected. While vapor-phase growth methods are used to synthesize uniform core-shell nanowire arrays of semiconductors such as Si and InP, more general strategies are required to produce related structures composed of a broader range of materials. Herein, we employ anodic aluminum oxide templates to synthesize CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite core copper thiocyanate shell nanowire arrays employing a combination of electrodeposition and solution casting methods. Using scanning electron microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, we confirm the target structure and show that adopting a core shell nanowire architecture accelerates the rate of charge quenching by nearly 3 orders of magnitude compared to samples with only an axial junction. Subsequently, we fit decay curves to a triexponential function to attribute fast quenching in core-shell nanowires to charge extraction by the copper thiocyanate nanotubes, as opposed to recombination within the perovskite nanowires.

We investigate the chemical distribution and electronic structure of solution processed CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite structures containing Na+, Cu+, and Ag+, which are lower valence metal ions than Pb2+ but have similar ionic radii. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction reveals a pronounced shift in the main perovskite peaks for the monovalent cation-based films, suggesting incorporation of these cations into the perovskite lattice as well as a preferential crystal growth in Ag+ containing perovskite structures. Furthermore, the synchrotron X-ray photoelectron measurements show a significant change in the valence band position for Cu- and Ag-doped films, although the perovskite bandgap remains the same, indicating a shift in the Fermi level position toward the middle of the bandgap. Such a shift infers that incorporation of these monovalent cations dedope the n-type perovskite films when formed without added cations. This dedoping effect leads to cleaner bandgaps as reflected by the lower energetic disorder in the monovalent cation-doped perovskite thin films as compared to pristine films. We also find that in contrast to Ag+ and Cu+, Na+ locates mainly at the grain boundaries and surfaces. Our theoretical calculations confirm the observed shifts in X-ray diffraction peaks and Fermi level as well as absence of intrabandgap states upon energetically favorable doping of perovskite lattice by the monovalent cations. We also model a significant change in the local structure, chemical bonding of metal-halide, and the electronic structure in the doped perovskites.

The thermodynamic phase stability is a key parameter that broadly governs whether the material is expected to be synthesizable, and whether it may degrade under certain operating conditions. Phase stability can be calculated using Density Functional Theory (DFT), but the significant computational cost makes such calculation potentially prohibitive when screening large numbers of possible compounds. In this work, we developed machine learning models to predict the thermodynamic phase stability of perovskite oxides using a dataset of more than 1900 DFT-calculated perovskite oxide energies. The phase stability was determined using convex hull analysis, with the energy above the convex hull (Ehull) providing a direct measure of the stability. We generated a set of 791 features based on elemental property data to correlate with the Ehull value of each perovskite compound, and found through feature selection that the top 70 features were sufficient to produce the most accurate models without significant overfitting. For classification, the extra trees algorithm achieved the best prediction accuracy of 0.93 (+/- 0.02), with an F-1 score of 0.88 (+/- 0.03). For regression, leave-out 20% cross-validation tests with kernel ridge regression achieved the minimal root mean square error (RMSE) of 28.5 (+/- 7.5) meV/atom between cross-validation predicted Ehull values and DFT calculations, with the mean absolute error (MAE) in cross-validation energies of 16.7 (+/- 2.3) meV/atom. This error is within the range of errors in DFT formation energies relative to elemental reference states when compared to experiments and therefore may be considered sufficiently accurate to use in place of full DFT calculations. We further validated our model by predicting the stability of compounds not present in the training set and demonstrated our machine learning models are a fast and effective means of obtaining qualitatively useful guidance for a wide-range of perovskite oxide stability, potentially impacting materials design choices in a variety of technological applications.",,,,"Morgan, Dane/B-7972-2008","Morgan, Dane/0000-0002-4911-0046; Li, Wei/0000-0002-1294-7467",,,,,,,,,,,,0927-0256,1879-0801,,,,JUL,2018,150,,,,,,454,463,,10.1016/j.commatsci.2018.04.033,,,,,,,,WOS:000433221000058,,,,,

Comprehensive analysis using specialised and conventional physical characterisation techniques has been undertaken to demonstrate that band alignment at the perovskite surface can be tuned to improve the solar cell efficiency via adsorption of benzenethiols with a significant dipole moment. Moreover, modification of the perovskite with cyano-substituted benzenethiol enhances charge extraction and reduces charge recombination in the devices.

Given that chemical treatment of the FET channel is expensive and tedious, and sometimes damages the underneath (dielectric) solution-processed layers, in this work, two facile and scalable mechanical treatment techniques are proposed. In the case of polymer FET, the wet spun film was excited by ultrasonic vibration imposed on the substrate. It is demonstrated that the micromixing effect induced by the ultrasonic radiation results in disentanglement, reorganization, and recrystallization of the polymer chains in the wet film. Ultrasonic vibration also improves the film leveling and uniformity and enhances the charge mobility of the channel of the polymer FET. In the case of the perovskite FET, we found that nitrogen blowing over the spun sample of the perovskite solution is a facile, yet effective substitution for the conventional anti-solvent treatment, commonly used to control the solvent evaporation rate. By nitrogen blowing, we achieved a uniform film of perovskite deposited on a solution-processed dielectric layer with domain sizes up to several hundreds of nanometers. By applying these techniques, the linear charge mobility of 0.041 cm(2) Vs(-1) and 0.055 cm 2 Vs(-1) were obtained for polymer and perovskite FETs under illumination, respectively.

NiO is a widely adopted hole transporting material in such devices, possessing a reasonably high hole mobility and suitable energy level positions to provide high efficiency solar cells. However, its use in inverted PSCs has typically resulted in relatively low fill factors, which arises from underlying contact issues between the perovskite and NiO layers. In this work, we address this issue by employing a thin mesoporous NiO scaffold formed via chemical bath deposition as the hole transporting layer. This hole transporting material is found to dramatically improve the performance of inverted mixed cation and anion PSCs by enhancing their light harvesting and charge transporting efficiencies. Optimized devices achieve efficiencies of up to 16.7% and fill factors as high as 85%.

The beta-phase composition, degree of crystallinity as well as mechanical, optical and energy harvesting properties of this composition has been investigated. Increased electroactive phase composition (91%) and dramatic improvement in tensile strength of the PVDF nanofiber mats is found by the addition of MAPbBr. This increase in electroactive phase composition can play a significant role in the enhancement of output power which is a premiere observation. The acoustic nanogenerator (ANG) made from MAPbBr doped PVDF nanofibers (NFs) can also be utilized in energy scavenging from acoustic vibration with a higher degree of acoustic sensitivity (similar to 13.8 V Pa-1) and efficiency (58.5%). This suggests that ANG could be a potential tool for power generation in portable electronics. This fact may open up the prospect of using the MAPbBr doped PVDF electrospun nanofibers, with their multifunctional properties such as vibration sensitivity, piezoelectric energy harvesting, green light emission capability (quantum yield similar to 32.6%), for various promising applications in portable electronics, noise detection and security monitoring.",,,,"ALAM, MEHEBUB/S-4067-2019; Ghorai, Uttam Kumar/V-7391-2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,2211-2855,2211-3282,,,,JUL,2018,49,,,,,,380,392,,10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.04.057,,,,,,,,WOS:000434829500046,,,,,

Here in the tin-based inverted PSCs, we introduced an ultrathin low-dimensional perovskite (LDP) interlayer close to the PEDOT: PSS/perovskite interface. The LDP structure advantageously assists the growth of perovskites close to the interface, resulting in improved film morphology and reduced trap states.

To accurately analyze the complex behavior, we applied a new model for e-h events in this hybrid material. The results obtained with sample having a high concentration of QDs (7.3 mass percentage) indicate: (i) a large population (92%) of the photogenerated charge carriers are affected by QDs presence. The main part of these carriers (85% of the total) in perovskite domain diffuse towards QDs, where they transfer to the interface (electrons) and QD's valence bands (holes) with rate constants of 1.2 x 10(10) s(-1) and 4.6 x 10(10) s(-1), respectively. 7% of these affected charged entities are excitons in the perovskite domain in close vicinity of the interface, and show a recombination rate constant of 3.7 x 10(10) s(-1). (ii) The carriers not affected by QDs presence (8%) recombine through known perovskite deactivation channels.

It was observed that the two-step formed SnO2 layers could efficiently improve the device performance of the flexible perovskite solar cells. Without such layers, no photovoltaic effect was observed due to poor wettability of substrate. After SnO2 was deposited, power conversion begins due to improved crystallinity of perovskite layer. Compared with one-step processed SnO2 layer, the two-step processed SnO2 layers could take the advantages of accelerated charge extraction, lowered contact resistance, as well as reduced charge recombination, which help to upgrade open circuit voltage, short circuit current, fill factor and power conversion efficiency of the flexible devices.

Besides, the degradation under constant illumination in ambient atmosphere observed in control devices is greatly improved. Thin film characterizations reveal that the addition of ammonium salt leads to smoother, more homogenous and better crystalline perovskite films, which exhibit more intense photoluminescence and a little longer fluorescent lifetime. Such improvements are owing to the dual-functional sulfoxide (S=O) in the dopant that can assist in perovskite crystallization and passivate the surface defects, thus giving rise to the eliminated J-V hysteresis.

It is desirable to obtain a high-performance perovskite material for use as a light harvester with excellent photovoltaic performances, including a high open circuit voltage (V-oc), high short circuit current density (J(sc)), high efficiency with minor recombination rate, and large optical absorption ability. In addition, this perovskite material should be able to harvest light over the entire absorption spectrum. Typically, the near-IR region is highly favorable for obtaining the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) for a solar cell. However, to date, the optical absorption ability of a lead-based single halide perovskite solar cell is still constrained below the near-IR region, which hinders its performance as a fully efficient perovskite solar cell. The insertion of tin within the methylammonium lead halide matrix, which forms CH3NH3SnxPb((1-x))I-3, provided excellent light absorption with photo-response coverage up to 1060 nm. Nevertheless, the low efficiency and low V-oc of the tin halide-based perovskite solar cell ascribed to the instability of the Sn (II) ion hinders the current solar cell application despite its good light-harvesting performance. Another approach to enhance the photovoltaic performance involves tailoring mixed halides for a perovskite solar cell. A wider absorption spectrum range is obtainable, and the band gap energy of the perovskite solar cell is tunable by adjusting the ratio of the mixed halides. The perovskite solar cells have high potential to be the largest energy production in the near future owing to their low module cost with high conversion efficiency, comparable to the silicon solar cell.",,,,"Lim, HN/C-4927-2011; Huang, NM/C-2423-2009","Lim, HN/0000-0003-2436-8953; ",,,,,,,,,,,,1364-0321,,,,,JUL,2018,90,,,,,,248,274,,10.1016/j.rser.2018.03.030,,,,,,,,WOS:000434917700019,,,,,

As a result, the short circuit current density decreased from initially 20 mA/cm(2) to lower than 10 mA/cm(2), which was the main reason for the decrease in the power conversion efficiency. The current falling was further checked by the transient photocurrent technique. Although the current dropping was slightly related to differential capacitance, the accumulated charge in the bulk of cells strongly increased by 50% along with the aging time. Compared to 24-hsealed PSCs, the lifetime of free carriers in both open circuit and short circuit conditions was significantly decreased after 48-h aging treatment, indicating that the decomposition occurred inside perovskite crystals.

A perovskite solar cell was simulated for best efficiency by replacing the traditional compact TiO2 layer with CdS (i.e., a hole-blocking layer) because CdS layers have been shown to possess a greater photostability than TiO2 with continuous illumination of sunlight. With the view of optimizing the device fabrication of perovskite/CdS thin-film solar cell (TFSC) for maximum efficiency, the perovskite/CdS TFSC structure was optimized theoretically using SCAPS-1D, which is possible because the perovskite layer has the same configuration and an excitation type as CdTe, copper-indium-gallium-selenide, and other inorganic semiconductor solar cells. Solar cell performance is highly dependent on the layer parameters, and so the effect that absorber thickness, bulk defects, and interface defects have on the device performance was studied and the device was optimized. Further, the effect that atmospheric conditions have on device performance was studied by varying the temperature and illumination density, and the optimum performance was found.

We critically examine this claim and discuss the conditions that affect the relation between basic properties of a band structure with photovoltaic or more generally optoelectronic functionality. While low effective masses may indeed have a beneficial effect on the open-circuit voltage in the non-radiative limit, using low effective masses as a generic criterion for high optoelectronic functionality would be an oversimplification.

Our study points out that multiple cation/anion perovskite films show major detrimental environmental impacts for all categories assessed, except for abiotic depletion potential, when they are compared with a canonical perovskite, MAPbI3. In addition, a closer analysis of the materials utilised for the synthesis of the different multiple cation perovskite compositions revealed that lead halide reagents and chlorobenzene produced the most adverse results in terms of impact. However, the former is used in all perovskite compositions and the latter can be avoided by the use of alternative fabrication methods to the anti-solvent method. To this end, FAI, with the current synthesis procedures, is the most decisive compound as it increases significantly the impacts and the c ost in comparison with MAI.

The perovskite films modified with PEls showed excellent stability, when studied over 20 days under ambient air conditions with a medial humidity of 60%. The results of XRD, UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence lifetime measurements showed that the PEI could not substitute for MA within the perovskite crystal lattice.

We find that a significant amount of work has been done to test scalable coating technologies, but also that often the methods that led to highest-performing cells in the laboratory (e.g. antisolvent processing) show limited compatibility with scalable coating methods. To achieve a high-yield and low-cost process, development must emphasize a high degree of control provided by sequential conversion of perovskite films and engineering of additives that fine-tune coating properties of perovskite precursor inks.

One important and expected application of perovskite halide semiconductors is solar cell operation including hot carriers. This advanced solar cell concept allows overcoming the Shockley-Queisser efficiency limit, thereby achieving energy conversion efficiency as high as 66% by extracting hot carriers. Understanding ultrafast photoexcited carrier dynamics and extraction in lead halide perovskites is crucial for these applications. Here, we clarify the hot carrier cooling and transfer dynamics in all-inorganic cesium lead iodide (CsPbI3) perovskite using transient absorption spectroscopy and Al2O3, poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) and TiO2 as selective contacts. We find that slow hot carrier cooling occurs on a timescale longer than 10 ps in the cases of CsPbI3/Al2O3 and CsPbI3/TiO2, which is attributed to hot phonon bottleneck for the high photoexcited carrier density. An efficient ultrafast hole transfer from CsPbI3 to the P3HT hole extracting layer is observed. These results suggest that hot holes can be extracted by appropriate selective contacts before energy dissipation into the halide perovskite lattice and that CsPbI3 has a potential for hot carrier solar cell applications.

An extensive knowledge of these properties along with a study of how they can be potentially tuned to suit requirements and improve the efficiency of devices is imperative in the realization of the full potential of these materials. In this regard, we present first-principles modeling and analysis of lead halide organometallic perovskites to determine their optoelectronic properties using density functional theory. Upon validating our model parameters by comparing the calculated optical constants and bandgaps of pure methylammonium lead halide perovskites with published experimental data, we extended the analysis to perovskites doped with various percentages of halogen atoms. We have determined the values of refractive index and extinction coefficient at different doping concentrations for a wide range of photon energies, establishing a comparison between them. In addition, we have investigated the variation in the bandgap and the effective mass of charge carriers with changes in doping concentration. We have also presented the effect of incorporating spin-orbit coupling on the band structure calculations. Our results show a significant reduction in the calculated value of the bandgap and also substantial changes in the values of effective mass upon incorporation of spin-orbit coupling.

The added small amount of ICBA filled the vacancies at the grain boundaries of perovskite, and produced continuous pathways for electron extraction to enhance performance. Steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence, together with the impedance measurements confirm the enhanced electron transporting property in perovskite-ICBA film. An excellent PCE of 18.14% is achieved in CH3NH3PbI3-xClx-A-based solar cells with significantly suppressed hysteresis. Poor solubility of PCBM leads to a low concentration of PCBM in perovskite precursor, and results in a moderate PCE of 16.54% in device containing Perovskite-PCBM. By contrast, device based on pristine perovskite shows an inferior efficiency of 15.49% with large hysteresis.

The introduction of PC60BM dramatically enhances the performance of the planar PSCs, and the reason has been systemically investigated. The results show that the existence of PC60BM could enhance the crystalline quality and grain boundary integration in perovskite films.

It is concerned to the formation of low band-gap I-rich domains that constitute attractive centers for the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, causing a significant red-shift of photoluminescence of the material with consequences for the operation of optoelectronic devices, such as light emitting diodes and photovoltaic cells. This effect is commonly observed as reversible, with a spontaneous remixing of the halogens occurring when the material is left in the dark. While the segregation process is already relatively well documented in the literature, much less attention has been paid to the causes and understanding of the remixing process. In this work are presented results that demonstrate the strong dependence of the remixing with the pressure to which the material is submitted. When the perovskite film is subjected to low pressure, it is noticed that the maximum displacement of PL during the dark time is significantly lower than in the case of the film at ambient pressure, indicating that under low pressure the remixing process is hampered.

We compare the properties of the double perovskite films made using AACVD with those made by the widely used spin-coating method. Films with purer crystalline phase (less CsI impurity) and far better stability in ambient air can be obtained by AACVD compared with spin coating. The AACVD-grown Cs2SnI6 films retain high phase purity for at least approximate to 100 days aging in air with negligible CsI impurities detected over this time, as determined by X-ray diffraction. The films exhibit an optical band gap energy (E-g) of ca. 1.3 eV and a homogeneous morphology with the expected nominal stoichiometry within error, as probed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Overall, the characteristics of the Cs2SnI6 films are highly process-dependent, e.g. they are influenced by the presence of hydroiodic acid (HI) in the precursor solution. Without HI addition, an iodine-deficient film with more CsI is produced, which also exhibits a larger E-g of ca. 1.6 eV. In addition to bulk properties, we utilise X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to scrutinise the surface characteristics in detail. We find excess Sn and I located at the surfaces. This can be attributed to the presence of SnI4 from the deposition precursor vapour. Furthermore, following aging in air, an increase in CsI impurity for the AACVD (+HI)-grown film is observed, along with a reduction in SnI4 at the surfaces. Near-ambient pressure XPS (NAP-XPS) is used to examine the surface stability of AACVD (+HI)-grown films on exposure to O-2 and H2O. No enhancement in the amount of CsI impurity is observed after both H2O vapour (9 mbar) and O-2 (5 mbar) exposure. Nevertheless, the concentrations of tin and iodine change after exposure, suggesting that SnI4 protects Cs2SnI6 from degradation.

The key to exploitation of the full potential of these substances by achieving even higher photovoltaic conversion efficiency lies in understanding of the charge (electron/hole) separation process and their transfer across the interface. As the latter depends on the nature of the electron/hole acceptor, quest for suitable carrier acceptor is an active area in this context. Herein, we explore the hole extraction ability of 1-ampinopyrene (AMP) from two very common all-inorganic perovskite nanocrystals (NCs), CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3, with different band gaps. The observation of efficient quenching of the photoluminescence (PL) of the NCs with little/negligible change in PL time profile in the presence of AMP indicates static interaction of the two interacting species. The band alignment of the NCs relative to the HOMO-LUMO energy levels of AMP and ultrafast pump-probe measurements reveal rapid hole transfer from the photoexcited NCs to AMP. The hole transfer time constants are estimated as 120 and 170 ps for CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 NCs, respectively. The rapid extraction of the hole, as observed with the present system, appears to be the result of strong anchoring of AMP on the NCs surface and facile transfer of the hole through conducive pyrene framework.

However, the role of the additional cations as well as the mixed halides is yet to be fully understood.

A notably longer charge carrier lifetime is achieved for perovskite films with additives and may be attributed to defect passivation. Selection rules are put forward based on the effect of the ionic size of an additive on phase stabilization and defect passivation. Addition of complementary size cation with respect to cation size of the parent perovskite, mainly helps stabilizing the perovskite phase by tuning tolerance factor, while addition of the similar size cation/anion, acts as defect passivator. The performance improvement of devices fabricated using NH4I as additive well supports this hypothesis, and offers yet another pathway toward harnessing the multitude of perovskite compositions to achieve high performing solar cells and perhaps other optoelectronic devices.",,,,"Wong, Lydia Helena/A-2239-2011; Soci, Cesare/A-8355-2008; Han, Guifang/A-3162-2017; Mhaisalkar, Subodh/K-5814-2019; Mathews, Nripan/C-8438-2011; Mhaisalkar, Subodh/K-5278-2019; Zhang, Sam/A-3867-2011; Mhaisalkar, Subodh/A-2231-2011","Soci, Cesare/0000-0002-0149-9128; Han, Guifang/0000-0001-6220-6424; Mhaisalkar, Subodh/0000-0002-9895-2426; Mathews, Nripan/0000-0001-5234-0822; Mhaisalkar, Subodh/0000-0002-9895-2426; Zhang, Sam/0000-0002-0716-1910",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-7447,,,,,28-Jun,2018,122,25,,,SI,,13884,13893,,10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b00980,,,,,,,,WOS:000437811500076,,,,,

Both inorganic (CsPbBr3) and organic (CH3NH3PbBr3-MAPbBr(3)) perovskite thin films were demonstrated to promote photo-dissociation of adsorbed ethyl chloride (EC), employing 532 nm pulsed laser irradiation under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions. From the post-irradiation temperature programmed desorption (TPD) analysis, the yield of photoproduct formation was found to be up to two orders of magnitude higher than for UV light-excited EC molecules on metallic and oxide surfaces. Photo-reactivity on top of the CsPbBr3 surface is almost an order of magnitude more efficient than on the CH3NH3PbBr3 surface, apparently due to the lower density of defect and surface states. A direct correlation was found between electron-induced luminescence and photoluminescence intensities and the photoreactivity cross-sections.

Light is known to induce phase segregation in mixed halide perovskites, enhance piezoelectricity, and change dipole moments of the unit cell. Therefore, it is appealing to consider photogenerated variations in the bulk polarizability and dielectric properties. Light-induced bulk polarization changes should be observable by capacitance measurements, preferentially at intermediate frequencies where the geometrical capacitance dominates. However, capacitance spectra are influenced by several capacitive and resistive mechanisms, which are also modulated by light. Capacitances may arise from dielectric bulk polarization, space-charge depletion zones, chemical electronic bulk storage, and interfacial accumulation mechanisms. This variety of capacitive mechanisms may induce wrong interpretations and produce misleading outcomes when uncritically connected to the bulk polarization response. It is shown here how capacitance voltage analyses performed at a given frequency are influenced by overlapping effects that mask the actual value of the geometrical capacitance.

This effect is usually ascribed to suppression of Sn2+ -> Sn4+ oxidation and/or decreased Sn vacancy concentration. These effects will change the doping, sometimes in opposite directions. Here we review the effect of addition of SnF2 during the formation of ASnX(3) layers as observed by different groups, both to the properties of the layers themselves and to photovoltaic cells made from these layers. SnF2 can affect many different properties of the ASnX(3) perovskites, including film morphology, doping, control over formation of unwanted crystal phases, material stability to various factors, and energy level positions. It also improves (in general) the performance of photovoltaic cells made with these layers. Besides focusing on all these issues, we also describe possible doping scenarios for the perovskites, including some that do not appear to have been considered before and conclude that the doping mechanism depends strongly on whether the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn2+ occurs during the materials preparation or after the film is formed, and if oxygen is involved.",,,,"Gupta, Satyajit/U-9680-2019; CAHEN, DAVID/K-1501-2012","Gupta, Satyajit/0000-0002-5323-341X; CAHEN, DAVID/0000-0001-8118-5446",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-7447,,,,,28-Jun,2018,122,25,,,SI,,13926,13936,,10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b01045,,,,,,,,WOS:000437811500081,,,,,

Compared to conventional direct annealing temperature (DHA) at 100 degrees C, using this strategy, MAPbI(3) films become more controllable, leading to superior film uniformity and device reproducibility with the champion device efficiency reaching 19.8%. More specifically, the coefficient of variation of efficiency for 49 cells is reduced to 5.9%, compared to 9.8% for that using DHA. The TSA process is carefully studied using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. It is found that in comparison with DHA the formation of hydrogen bonding and crystallization of perovskite are much slower and can be better controlled when using TSA. The improvements in film uniformity and device reproducibility are attributed to: 1) controllable MAPbI(3) crystal growth stemming from the progressive formation of hydrogen bonding between methylammonium and halide; 2) suppression of intermediate phase film dewetting, which is believed to be due to its decreased mobility at the initial low-temperature annealing stage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1613-6810,1613-6829,,,,27-Jun,2018,14,26,,,,,,,UNSP 1800181,10.1002/smll.201800181,,,,,,,,WOS:000436408800002,29806184,,,,

Herein, oxygen plasma treatment is introduced as a simple means to change the surface energy and work function of hydrophobic polymer interlayers for use as p-contacts in perovskite solar cells. We find that upon oxygen plasma treatment, the hydrophobic surfaces of different prototypical p-type polymers became sufficiently hydrophilic to enable subsequent perovskite junction processing. In addition, the oxygen plasma treatment also increased the ionization potential of the polymer such that it became closer to the valance band energy of the perovskite. It was also found that the oxygen plasma treatment could increase the electrical conductivity of the p-type polymers, facilitating more efficient charge extraction.

However, most of the known lead-free hybrids show wide band gaps (E-g > 1.9 eV) that afford weak visible-light absorption. Here, we show a newly conceptual design strategy of intercalating triiodide to decrease the prototypic band gap by ca. similar to 0.44 eV. A new hybrid semiconducting material of (4-methylpiperidinium)(4)center dot I-3 center dot BiI6 (MP-T-BiI6), adopting the zero-dimensional (0D) perovskite-like framework, was reconstructed from its prototype of (4-methylpiperidinium)(3)Bi2I9 (MP-Bi2I9). It is noteworthy that MP-T-BiI6 has a narrow band gap of 1.58 eV, almost comparable to that of CH3NH3PbI3 (similar to 1.5 eV), which reveals its potential as the highly efficient light absorber. Importantly, its semiconducting properties were solidly confirmed by notable hole mobility (similar to 12.8 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)), charge-trap density (similar to 1.13 x 1010 cm(-3)), and photoconductive behaviors. Moreover, theoretical calculations further disclose that the I-5p orbitals of triiodide induce the band-edge reconstruction and behave as a new conduction-band minimum at the Brillouin zone center.

Simple precipitation from solution allows the partial substitution of MA in MAPbI(3) by H3NCH2CH2NH3 (H(2)en). Surprisingly, there is 1:1 exchange of the monovalent cation MA by the dication H(2)en. The charge compensation results from a deficit of Pb2+, leading to a series MA(1-2y)(H(2)en)(2y)Pb1-yI3 with 0 <= y <= 0.25. This model has been supported by single-crystal measurements and NMR investigations. The substitution results in a continuous shift of the band gap from 1.51 to 2.1eV and a color change from black to orange-red. The H(2)en content stabilizes the cubic high-temperature (HT) form of MAPbI(3). There is a linear correlation between band gap and unit cell volume.

In particular, it has been suggested that ion migration contributes to the commonly observed hysteresis in the current-voltage measurements of PSCs, but the rate of ion migration and its effects on the electronic properties of PSCs remain to be addressed. In this work, electron-beam-induced current (EBIC) is used to directly map changes in local current extraction in organic-inorganic PSCs under applied voltage. By combining EBIC mapping, standard current-voltage measurements, and external quantum efficiency measurements, it is shown that between the two potential roles that point defects play in device enhancement under voltage biasing, the effects caused by defect-mediated ion migration outweigh the effects from the filling of trap states caused by these defects. Evidence is also provided for ion migration preferentially at local features such as extended defects.

In this report, a small molecule (ITIC-Th) is employed to stabilize the perovskite precursor solution containing mixed cations and halides. It is found that ITIC-Th can effectively suppress the formation of yellow -phase in the films made from aged precursor solutions. Consequently, the devices fabricated from the aged precursor solution with ITIC-Th experience much less efficiency drop with the increase of the precursor aging time-from 19.20% (fresh) to 16.55% (39 d), compared with the devices made from conventional precursor solutions dropping from 18.07% (fresh) to 1.76% (39 d). The characterizations suggest that ITIC-Th is beneficial for CH3NH3+ cations to be incorporated into the crystal structure, facilitating the formation of perovskite phase. Furthermore, the presence of ITIC-Th in the perovskite thin film gives rise to additional photocurrent as well as improved fill factor due to the well-matched energy levels, the passivation of defects, and the complementary absorption spectra, suggesting a new route toward future high-efficiency solar cellsincorporating organic non-fullerene acceptors and halide perovskite materials into the same active layer.",,,,"Lu, Xinhui/Q-2398-2019; Lu, Xinhui/N-2133-2018; Zhao, Ni/P-2707-2019; Zhao, Ni/E-7914-2013; XU, Jian-Bin (J.B.)/C-9374-2011","Lu, Xinhui/0000-0002-1908-3294; Lu, Xinhui/0000-0002-1908-3294; Zhao, Ni/0000-0002-1536-8516; Zhao, Ni/0000-0002-1536-8516; XU, Jian-Bin (J.B.)/0000-0002-0323-8140; Xu, Jianbin/0000-0003-0509-9508",,,,,,,,,,,,1614-6832,1614-6840,,,,25-Jun,2018,8,18,,,,,,,1703399,10.1002/aenm.201703399,,,,,,,,WOS:000436103300005,,,,,

We first assemble three chemically distinct (AA')(BB')I-6 double perovskites using centrosymmetric ABI(3) perovskite iodides (where A = Cs, Rb, K and B = Sn, Ge) as building units. In each superlattice, we investigate the effects of three types of A- and B-site cation ordering schemes and three different BI6 octahedral rotation patterns. Out of these 27 combinations, we find that 15 produce polar space groups and display spontaneous electric polarizations ranging from 0.26 to 23.33 mu C/cm(2) . Furthermore, we find that a layered A-site/rock salt B-site ordering, in the presence of an a(0)a(0) c(+) rotation pattern, produces a chiral vortex-like A-site displacement pattern. We then investigate the effect of epitaxial strain on one of these compounds, (CsRb)(SnGe)I-6 , in layered and rock salt ordered configurations. In both phases, we find strong competition between the cation ordering schemes as well as an enhancement of the spontaneous polarization magnitude under tensile strain. Finally, using a hybrid density functional with fractional Fock exchange, we find the iodide superlattices display semiconducting band gaps ranging from 0.2 to 1.3 eV.

The demonstrated power conversion efficiency of the SCs based on MTP (PSCs for short) has reached over 20%. An MTP material is a kind of soft ionic solid semiconductor. The intrinsic optoelectronic properties of MTP are greatly determined by several factors, such as the crystalline phase, doping type, impurities, elemental composition, and defects in its crystal structure. In the development of PSCs, a good understanding and smart engineering of the defects in MTP have been demonstrated to be a key factor for the fabrication of high-efficiency PSCs. In this review, we start with a brief introduction to the types of defects and the mechanisms for their formation in MTP. Then, the positive and negative impacts of defects on the important optoelectronic features of MTP are presented. The optoelectronic properties mainly include charge recombination, charge transport, ion migration, and structural stability. Moreover, commonly used techniques for the characterization of the defects in MTP are systematically summarized.

As thermodynamics reveals, the material is unstable against oxygen, primarily because of the large driving force of water formation. While under light the material quickly degrades, in the dark the surface reaction kinetics - not the bulk transport - is very sluggish and keeps it metastable.

The hysteresis behavior, however, is one of the major concerning issues accompanying the development of PSCs. In this context, we propose a new mechanism that explains the origin of hysteresis behavior by analyzing the electrical processes after changing the external electrical bias: the compensating electric field to the scanning voltage induced by drifting carriers. This is further verified by experiments, where we observed much reduced hysteresis in the current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics for the PSCs based on a thinner perovskite layer, which is a result of more evenly distributed electrons and holes. Moreover, light illumination with different wavelengths was applied to vary the initial carrier distribution inside the perovskite layer. We found that J-V curves when illuminating the device with longer wavelengths exhibited diminished hysteresis, which could be a result of more evenly generated carriers due to a smaller absorptivity than that with short wavelength illumination. Based on the proposed model, three key factors affecting the hysteresis behavior were pointed out, including the initial carrier distribution, the carrier transport properties in the perovskite layer, and the carrier extraction properties at the interfaces. Strategies to construct hysteresis-free and stable PSCs have thus been accordingly proposed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1463-9076,1463-9084,,,,21-Jun,2018,20,23,,,,,16285,16293,,10.1039/c8cp01432a,,,,,,,,WOS:000439173700073,29868673,,,,

Specifically, we find that dispersing ITIC molecules can largely decrease the J(sc) (photocurrent difference) generated by switching the photoexcitation from linear to circular polarization with the same intensity. This phenomenon provides direct evidence that dispersed optically polarizable ITIC molecules can increase the SOC in organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites through interaction between introduced electrical polarization and SOC. Furthermore, impedance studies indicate that dispersing ITIC molecules can decrease the density of trap states by passivating the grain boundary defects and simultaneously increases the carrier mobilities. Consequently, non-radiative recombination is reduced upon decreasing the density of trap states through dispersing the ITIC molecules, according to transient photoluminescence studies. The UV-Vis and FTIR spectral studies indicate formation of a bond between Pb, N and O, showing a direct interaction between the hybrid perovskite MAPbI(3-x)Cl(x) and dispersed ITIC molecules.

Results demonstrate an advantageous cooperative effect of CNTs and DMSO on the co-modified film. The dispersed CNTs with a grid-like structure throughout PEDOT:PSS matrix plays dual roles:to promote the perovskite crystal growth on co-modified surface and to reduce the sheet resistance of the co-modified film, while DMSO improves the conductivity of the co-modified film and controls the loss of CNTs from the co-modified film.

The trilayer shows positive effects on both perovskite synthesis and device performance. The ZnO layer assists growth of CH3NH3PbI3-xClx (x approximate to 0) annealed at a lower temperature and with a shorter time, which is due to a more rapid and easier decomposition of the intermediate CH3NH3PbCl3 phase in the growth of CH3NH3PbI3-xClx. All three materials in the trilayer are important for obtaining PSCs with a high PCE. ZnO is critical for enhancing the open circuit voltage by ensuring proper energy alignment with the TiO2 and C-60 layers. C-60 enhances carrier extraction from the CH3NH3PbI3-xClx layer.

By synergistically controlling the valence band position (VBP) of the perovskite and the interface layer, an interface engineering strategy was successfully used to increase the efficiency of hole transfer from the perovskite to the HTM layer, resulting in the power conversion efficiency increasing from 15.17 to 18.56%.

Structural analysis using single-crystal as well as powder X-ray diffraction revealed that the synthesized materials are isostructural with SrZrSe3, crystallizing in the orthorhombic space group Pnma (#62) with lattice parameters a = 8.901(2) angstrom; b = 3.943 (1) angstrom; c = 14.480(3) angstrom; and Z = 4 for the x = 0 composition. Thermal conductivity data of SrHfSe3 revealed low values ranging from 0.9 to 1.3 W m(-1) K-1 from 300 to 700 K, which is further lowered to 0.77 W m(-1) K-1 by doping with 1 mol % Sb for Sr. Electronic property measurements indicate that the compound is quite insulating with an electrical conductivity of 2.9 S/cm at 873 K, which was improved to 6.7 S/cm by 0.5 mol % Sb doping. Thermopower data revealed that SrHfSe3 is a p-type semiconductor with thermopower values reaching a maximum of 287 mu V/K at 873 K for the 1.0 mol % Sb sample. The optical band gap of Sr1-xSbxHfSe3 samples, as determined by density functional theory calculations and the diffuse reflectance method, is similar to 1.00 eV and increases with Sb concentration to 1.15 eV. Careful analysis of the partial densities of states (PDOS) indicates that the band gap in SrHfSe3 is essentially determined by the Se-4p and Hf-Sd orbitals with little to no contribution from Sr atoms. Typically, band edges of p- and d-character are a good indication of potentially strong absorption coefficient due to the high density of states of the localized p and d orbitals.

The optimal bandgap values of the prepared perovskite (1.51 eV) and NiS (3.71 eV) materials found to be favorable in achieving the active absorbing and hole extraction properties in PSCs. The surface morphology of the nickel sulphide materials is found to be highly dependent on the NiS-carbon composition. The current density-voltage (J-V) results of the fabricated perovskite solar cells with nickel sulphide-carbon composite hole transporting layer (HTL) suggests that incorporation of commercial carbon paste into the nickel sulphide nanoparticles tends to promote the charge carrier transporting ability and resulted in yielding high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.20%, when compared to that of the bare NiS (1.87%). The results show that this nickel sulphide-carbon composite can serve as an efficient dual role as an HTL to transport holes and as a conductive counter electrode for the planar heterojunction PSCs with the structure FTO/compact-TiO2/porous-TiO2/perovskite/NiS-carbon.

Perovskite thin films have demonstrated amplified spontaneous emission thresholds as low as 1.6 mu J cm(-2) and lasing thresholds as low as 0.2 mJ cm(-2). Recently the performance of perovskite light emitting diodes has rapidly risen due to the formation of quasi 2D films using bulky ligands such as phenylethylammonium. Despite the high photoluminescent yield and external quantum efficiency of quasi 2D perovskites, few reports exist on amplified spontaneous emission. We show within this report that the threshold for amplified spontaneous emission of quasi 2D perovskite films increases with the concentration of phenylethylammonium. We attribute this increasing threshold to a charge transfer state at the PEA interface that competes for excitons with the ASE process. Additionally, the comparatively slow inter-grain charge transfer process cannot significantly contribute to the fast radiative recombination in amplified spontaneous emission.

Potassium doping has recently emerged as a universal way to overcome this adverse phenomenon. While the atomistic origins of J-V hysteresis are still not fully understood, it is essential to rationalize the atomic-level effect of protocols that lead to its suppression. Here, using K-39 MAS NMR at 21.1 T we provide for the first time atomic-level characterization of the potassium-containing phases that are formed upon KI doping of multication and multianion lead halide perovskites. We find no evidence of potassium incorporation into 3D perovskite lattices of the recently reported materials. Instead, we observe formation of a mixture of potassium-rich phases and unreacted KI. In the case of Br-containing lead halide perovskites doped with KI, a mixture of KI and KBr ensues, leading to a change in the Br/I ratio in the perovskite phase with respect to the undoped perovskite.

In this work, we study the photovoltaic potential of solution-processed antimony (Sb)-based compounds with the formula A(3)Sb(2)I(9) (A = Cs, Rb, and K). We experimentally determine bandgap magnitude and type, structure, carrier lifetime, exciton binding energy, film morphology, and photovoltaic device performance. We use density functional theory to compute the equilibrium structures, band structures, carrier effective masses, and phase stability diagrams. We find the A-site cation governs the structural and optoelectronic properties of these compounds. Cs3Sb2I9 has a 0D structure, the largest exciton binding energy (175 +/- 9 meV), an indirect bandgap, and, in a solar cell, low photocurrent (0.13 mA cm(-2)). Rb3Sb2I9 has a 2D structure, a direct bandgap, and, among the materials investigated, the lowest exciton binding energy (101 +/- 6 meV) and highest photocurrent (1.67 mA cm(-2)). K3Sb2I9 has a 2D structure, intermediate exciton binding energies (129 +/- 9 meV), and intermediate photocurrents (0.41 mA cm(-2)). Despite remarkably long lifetimes in all compounds (54, 9, and 30 ns for Cs-, Rb-, and K-based materials, respectively), low photocurrents limit performance of all devices. We conclude that carrier collection is limited by large exciton binding energies (experimentally observed) and large carrier effective masses (calculated from density functional theory). The highest photocurrent and efficiency (0.76%) were observed in the Rb-based compound with a direct bandgap, relatively lower exciton binding energy, and lower calculated electron effective mass.

Here, we use electronic structure calculations at different levels of theory (density functional theory (DFT), hybrid DFT, and QSGW, with and without spin-orbit interactions) to investigate the presently elusive origin of this effect. Contrary to current conflicting studies, our results show that neither spin-orbit interactions nor the composition induced changes of the crystal structure and ordering of atoms contributes to the nonlinearity of the band gap. We find that the strong nonlinearity is primarily a consequence of chemical effects, i.e., the mismatch in energy between s and p atomic orbitals of Pb and Sn, which form the band edges of the alloy.

However, the use of such an expensive chemical may impede progress toward large-scale industrial applications. Here, we report on the synthesis of perovskite powders by using inexpensive low-grade (99%) PbI2 and on the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells prepared from a powder-based single precursor. Pure APbI(3) [A = methylammonium (MA) or formamidinium (FA)] perovskite powders were synthesized by treating low-grade PbI2 with MAI or FAI in acetonitrile at ambient temperature. The structural phase purity was confirmed by X-ray diffraction. The solar cell with a MAPbI(3) film prepared from the synthesized perovskite powder demonstrated a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.14%, which is higher than the PCE of MAPbI(3) films prepared by using both MAI and PbI2 as precursors (PCE = 13.09% for 99% pure PbI2 and PCE = 16.39% for 99.9985% pure PbI2). The synthesized powder showed better absorption and photoluminescence, which were responsible for the better photovoltaic performance. For the FAPbI(3) powder, a solution with a yellow non-perovskite delta-FAPbI(3) powder synthesized at room temperature was found to lead to a black perovskite film, whereas a solution with the black perovskite alpha-FAPbI(3) powder synthesized at 150 degrees C was not transformed into a black perovskite film. The alpha <->delta transition between the powder and film was assumed to correlate with the difference in the iodoplumbates in the powder-dissolved solution. An average PCE of 17.21% along with a smaller hysteresis [Delta PCE = PCEreverse-PCEforward)=1.53%] was demonstrated from the perovskite solar cell prepared by using delta-FAPbI(3) powder; this PCE is higher than the average PCE of 17.05% with a larger hysteresis (Delta PCE = 2.71%) for a device based on a conventional precursor solution dissolving MAI with high-purity PbI2.

In this study, this concern was addressed by analysing the life cycle toxicity of metals (cadmium, copper, lead, nickel, tin and zinc) that are commonly used in emerging PVs. In estimating the potential metal release, a new model that incorporates field conditions (crack size, time, and glass thickness) and physiochemical properties (diffusion coefficient and solubility product) was introduced. The results show that the use phase toxicity of copper and lead can be higher than the extraction phase toxicity. Thus, precautionary loss limits to manage toxic impacts from the use phase were proposed. Also, the toxicity from different layers of perovskite, copper zinc tin sulphide (CZTS), and quantum dot (Qp) type of solar cells was compared. It was found that cadmium sulphide (compared to zinc oxide and tin oxide) and lead (II) sulphide (compared to lead (II) iodine and CZTS) were less toxic alternatives for the electron selective layer and light absorber, respectively.

To solve this problem, previous works mainly focus on embedding perovskite NCs into water-resistant matrix to form large composites (size of microns or larger). As an alternative solution without serious changing of NC size, enhancing the stability of perovskite NCs themselves by ligand engineering is rarely reported. In this work, we used hyperbranched polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers with two different generations (G0 and G4) to synthesize CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite NCs with high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields (QY) above 70% and a new record stability. A novel dendrimers generation-dependent stability of perovskite NCs was observed. The water-resistance time is 18 h (27 h) for perovskite NCs capped by G0 (G4) generation of PAMAM, which is 7 times (11 times) longer than that of traditional oleic acid-capped NCs. Similar PAMAM generation-related stability is also observed in moisture-resistance tests. The stability time against moisture is 500 h (800 h) for G0 (G4) generation of PAMAM-capped perovskite NCs, which is a new record stability time against moisture for CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite NCs. In addition, our results also indicate that PAMAM ligands outside perovskite NCs can dramatically slow down the speed of halide exchange. Even for the mixture of perovskite NCs with two different halide composition, the original luminescence properties of PAMAM-capped perovskite NCs can retain after mixing. In view of slow halide exchange speed, excellent water and moisture stability, PAMAM dendrimers-capped perovskite NCs and their mixture are available as color conversion single layer in fabrication of light-emitting diodes (LED).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0957-4484,1361-6528,,,,8-Jun,2018,29,23,,,,,,,235603,10.1088/1361-6528/aab93b,,,,,,,,WOS:000429921900001,29570094,,,,

The analyzed fullerene derivatives bear several types (indene, anthracene and 1,2-dimethoxymethano groups) and numbers (mono-, bis- and tris-adducts) of addends. Our systematical study enables a direct correlation of the values obtained for the individual fullerenes, and a linear relationship of the redox potential and the number of addends was found. The high lying LUMO levels of the bis- and tris-adducts are favorable in terms of a high open circuit voltage in combination with polymer donors in bulk heterojunction solar cells. Considering only high LUMO values IC(60)TA and IC(70)TA are the most promising materials for organic solar cells revealing a high V-OC.

Thermally induced exchange between the two kinds of excitons is found and modeled quantitatively; this has led to the determination of an activation energy of 13 meV. Thermal redistribution of trapped excitons and thermal expansion-induced blueshift of the bandgap are jointly responsible for the abnormal temperature dependence of the position of Peak 1, whereas the latter is predominant for the monotonic blueshift of the position of Peak 2 with an increase in temperature.

The effect of this inherent defect tolerance, namely the absence of deep trap states, on the photoluminescence (PL) of perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) is currently not well understood. The PL emission of NCs fluctuates in time according to power law kinetics (PL intermittency, or blinking), a phenomenon that has been explored over the past two decades in a vast array of nanocrystal (NC) materials. The kinetics of the blinking process in perovskite NCs have not been widely explored. Here, PL trajectories of individual orthorhombic cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) perovskite NCs are measured using a range of excitation intensities. The power law kinetics of the bright NC state are observed to truncate exponentially at long durations, with a truncation time that decreases with increasing intensity before saturating at an intensity corresponding to an average formation of a single exciton. The results indicate that a diffusion-controlled electron transfer (DCET) mechanism is the most likely charge trapping process, while Auger autoionization plays a lesser role.

This is because localized charge carriers diminish overlap between electron and hole wave functions and decrease the NA coupling by a factor of 6. In addition, polaron formation increases the band gap of CsPbBr3, slowing down recombination further. The smaller NA coupling and larger band gap compete successfully with the longer decoherence time, extending the recombination to tens of nanoseconds.

The compound was synthesized through a simple approach based on the reaction between an azetidine aqueous solution and lead acetate dissolved in an excess of hot concentrated aqueous HI. The compound was recrystallized by the vapor diffusion method. Since the synthesized AzPbI(3) crystals consistently turned out to be twinned and disordered, the structure determination was performed by using powder X-ray diffraction data analysis procedures. The material was found to possess a quite complex and large rhombohedral crystal structure with a zig-zag array of groups composed of three PbI6 octahedra sharing faces along the c-axis. Unfortunately, because of the extended cationic sublattice disorder and of the large X-ray scattering factor difference between the atoms composing the (CH2)(3)NH2PbI3 (AzPbI(3)) unit cell, the position of azetidinium cations could not be determined with confidence. The material was also characterized by CHN, ESI-MS analyses and FT-IR spectroscopy in order to verify its chemical composition. Furthermore, TG-DTA coupled to quadrupole mass spectrometry, temperature-controlled powder XRD and Knudsen effusion mass spectrometry were employed to evaluate the thermal stability of the material.

Optical properties turned out to be very sensitive to preparative conditions. In addition, a test of mutual solid solubility with methylammonium lead iodide, CH3NH3PbI3, was performed by co-precipitation of both perovskites. Powder XRD clearly showed mutual solubility.

The BiI3 films deposited on graphene show flatter morphologies and significantly better crystallinities than that of BiI3 films on SiO2 substrates, mainly due to weak van der Waals interactions at the graphene/BiI3 interface. Hybrid photodetectors with highly crystalline graphene/BiI3 heterostructures demonstrate an ultrahigh responsivity of 6 x 10(6) A W-1, shot-noise-limited detectivity of 7 x 10(14) Jones, and a relatively short response time of approximate to 8 ms.

To overcome this drawback, we synthesized a copolymer (P(SS-co-TFPMA)) ionomer consisting of PSS and tetrafluoropropylmethacrylate (TFPMA) as an alternative to conventional PEDOT:PSS. The PEDOT:P(SS-co-TFPMA) copolymer solution and its film exhibited excellent homogeneity and high phase stability compared with a physical mixture of TFPMA with PEDOT:PSS solution. During spin coating, a selforganized conducting PEDOT:P(SS-co-TFPMA) HEL evolved and the topmost PEDOT:P(SS-co-TFPMA) film showed a hydrophobic surface with a higher WF compared to that of the pristine PEDOT:PSS film because of its chemically bonded electron-withdrawing fluorinated functional groups.

However, the relatively low light absorption cross-section and fast electron-hole recombination rate can lead to rapid exciton annihilation and small light gain, which restrict the commercial applications of pure graphene-based photodetector. The perovskite has attracted much attention because of its high photoelectric conversion efficiency in the field of solar cells. The perovskite has the advantages of long carrier diffusion distance and high optical absorption coefficient, which can effectively make up for the shortcomings of pure graphene-based field-effect transistor. In this work, a field-effect transistor photodetector is demonstrated with the combination of graphene and halide perovskite quantum dots (CsPbI3) serving as conductive channel materials. The graphene is prepared by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition, and the quantum dots are CsPbI3 perovskite. The electrical properties of graphene and pure graphene-based field-effect transistor are detected and analyzed by using the Raman spectrum. The results show that the graphene has good intrinsic electrical properties. Unlike previous report in which bulk perovskite was used, the perovskite quantum dot field-effect transistor photodetector has an obvious light response to 400 nm signal light, and shows the excellent photoelectrical performance. Under the illumination of 400 nm light, the signal light could be detected steadily and repeatedly by the graphene-perovskite quantum dot photodetector and converted into photocurrent. The photocurrent of the photodetector has a rapid rise, and the maximum value can reach 64 mu A at a light power of 12 mu W. The corresponding responsivity is 6.4 A.W-1, which is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the general single graphene photodetector (10(-2) A.W-1), and it is also higher than that of perovskite-based photodetector (0.4 A.W-1). In addition, the photoconductive gain and detectivity arrive at 3.7 x 10(4) and 6 x 10(7) Jones (1 Jones = 1 cm.Hz(1/2).W-1), respectively. The results of this study demonstrate that the graphene-perovskite quantum dot photodetector can be a promising candidate for commercial UV light detectors.",,,,"Yu, Kehan/K-7635-2019",,,,,,,,,,,,,1000-3290,,,,,5-Jun,2018,67,11,,,,,,,118502,10.7498/aps.67.20180129,,,,,,,,WOS:000443197300029,,,,,

The newly developed HTMs are systematically compared with the conventional 2,2',7,7'-tetrakis(N, N'-di-p-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9'-spirbiuorene (Spiro-OMeTAD). ACE-ANT-ACE and TPA-ANT-TPA are used as a dopant-free HTM in mesoscopic TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM solid-state PSCs, and the performance as well as stability are compared with Spiro-OMeTAD-based PSCs. After extensive optimization of the metal oxide scaffold and device processing conditions, dopant-free novel TPA-ANT-TPA HTM based PSC devices achieve a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.5% with negligible hysteresis. An impressive current of 21 mA cm(-2) is also confirmed from photocurrent density with a higher fill factor of 0.79. The obtained PCE of 17.5% utilizing TPA-ANT-TPA is higher performance than the devices prepared using doped Spiro-OMeTAD (16.8%) as hole transport layer at 1 sun condition. It is found that doping of LiTFSI salt increases hygroscopic characteristics in Spiro-OMeTAD; this leads to the fast degradation of solar cells. While, solar cells prepared using undoped TPA-ANT-TPA show dewetting and improved stability. Additionally, the new HTMs form a fully homogeneous and completely covering thin film on the surface of the active light absorbing perovskite layers that acts as a protective coating for underlying perovskite films.

In this work, time-of-flight, time-resolved microwave conductivity, and thermally stimulated current measurements are performed to elucidate the impact of the inorganic cation additives on the trap landscape and charge transport properties within perovskite solar cells. These complementary techniques allow for the assessment of both local features within the perovskite crystals and macroscopic properties of films and full devices. Strikingly, Csincorporation is shown to reduce the trap density and charge recombination rates in the perovskite layer. This is consistent with the significant improvements in the open-circuit voltage and fill factor of Cs-containing devices. By comparison, Rb-addition results in an increased charge carrier mobility, which is accompanied by a minor increase in device efficiency and reduced currentvoltage hysteresis. By mixing Cs and Rb in quadruple cation (Cs-Rb-FA-MA) perovskites, the advantages of both inorganic cations can be combined.

A particularly difficult challenge lies in warranting the practical utility of such semiconductor NCs in the red and infrared spectral regions. In this context, all three archetypal A-site monocationic perovskites-CH3NH3PbI3, CH(NH2)(2)PbI3, and CsPbI3-suffer from either chemical or thermodynamic instabilities in their bulk form. A promising approach toward the mitigation of these challenges lies in the formation of multinary compositions (mixed cation and mixed anion). In the case of multinary colloidal NCs, such as quinary Cs(x)FA(1-x)Pb-(Br1-yIy)(3) NCs, the outcome of the synthesis is defined by a complex interplay between the bulk thermodynamics of the solid solutions, crystal surface energies, energetics, dynamics of capping ligands, and the multiple effects of the reagents in solution. Accordingly, the rational synthesis of such NCs is a formidable challenge. Herein, we show that droplet-based microfluidics can successfully tackle this problem and synthesize Cs(x)FA(1-x)PbI(3) and Cs(x)FA(1-x)Pb(Br1-yIy)(3) NCs in both a time- and cost-efficient manner. Rapid in situ photoluminescence and absorption measurements allow for thorough parametric screening, thereby permitting precise optical engineering of these NCs. In this showcase study, we fine-tune the photoluminescence maxima of such multinary NCs between 700 and 800 nm, minimize their emission line widths (to below 40 nm), and maximize their photoluminescence quantum efficiencies (up to 89%) and phase/chemical stabilities. Detailed structural analysis revealed that the Cs(x)FA(1-x)Pb(Br1-yIy)(3) NCs adopt a cubic perovskite structure of FAPbI(3), with iodide anions partially substituted by bromide ions. Most importantly, we demonstrate the excellent transference of reaction parameters from microfluidics to a conventional flask based environment, thereby enabling up-scaling and further implementation in optoelectronic devices. As an example, Cs(x)FA(1-x)Pb(Br1-yIy)(3) NCs with an emission maximum at 735 nm were integrated into light-emitting diodes, exhibiting a high external quantum efficiency of 5.9% and a very narrow electroluminescence spectral bandwidth of 27 nm.",,,,"MS-Powder+MS-Surfdiff+Micro-XAS+Super-XAS, SLS/M-1551-2019; Enrique, Colacio/L-6020-2014; Ochsenbein, Stefan/S-4402-2019; Ochsenbein, Stefan T/C-2221-2012; Protesescu, Loredana/P-3031-2017; Masciocchi, Norberto/K-4400-2015","Enrique, Colacio/0000-0002-6745-9241; Ochsenbein, Stefan/0000-0002-5909-8650; Ochsenbein, Stefan T/0000-0002-5909-8650; Protesescu, Loredana/0000-0002-9776-9881; Bodnarchuk, Maryna/0000-0001-6597-3266; Masciocchi, Norberto/0000-0001-9921-2350; Lignos, Ioannis/0000-0002-6816-3290; Shynkarenko, Yevhen/0000-0002-1587-1752; KUMAR, SUDHIR/0000-0002-2994-7084; Maceiczyk, Richard/0000-0001-5735-2689; Morad, Viktoriia/0000-0002-9712-0433; Bertolotti, Federica/0000-0002-6001-9040",,,,,,,,,,,,1936-0851,1936-086X,,,,JUN,2018,12,6,,,,,5504,5517,,10.1021/acsnano.8b01122,,,,,,,,WOS:000436910200047,29754493,,,,

It shows that the device based on the TiO2/ZnSe ETL with cascade conduction band level can effectively reduce the interfacial charge recombination and promote carrier transfer with the champion PCE of 18.57%. In addition, the ZnSe-based device exhibits a better photostability than the control device due to the greater ultraviolet (UV) light harvesting of the ZnSe layer, which can efficiently prevent the perovskite film from intense UV-light exposure to avoid associated degradation.

Herein, we have succeeded in reducing the laser size to subwavelength scale in three dimensions using an individual CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocuboid. Even though the side length of the nanocuboid laser is only similar to 400 nm, single-mode Fabry-Perot lasing at room temperature with laser thresholds of 40.2 and 374 mu J/cm(2) for one- and two-photon excitation has been achieved, respectively, with the corresponding quality factors of 2075 and 1859.

These predictions from first principles have made it possible to elucidate the characteristics of semiconductors used in industry, including group III-V compounds such as GaN, GaP, and GaAs and their alloys with related Al and In compounds; amorphous oxides, represented by In-Ga-Zn-O; transparent conductive oxides (TCOs), represented by In2O3, SnO2, and ZnO; and photovoltaic absorber and buffer layer materials such as CdTe and CdS among group II-VI compounds and chalcopyrite CuInSe2, CuGaSe2, and CuIn(1-x)GaxSe(2) (CIGS) alloys, in addition to the prototypical elemental semiconductors Si and Ge.

The formation and deposition of strontium titanate (STO) nanoparticles on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass is essential to achieve high efficiency in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting application. In the present study, STO crystalline nanoparticles with a diameter range of 30-56 nm were successfully prepared by using the hydrothermal technique by varying the temperatures from 60 degrees C to 180 degrees C. Based on the results, the morphology of perovskite-type STO was significantly influenced by hydrothermal reaction temperature and it was found that the sample STO-150 exhibited the highest PEC water splitting performance with a photocurrent density of 0.65 mA/cm(2) under UV irradiation. This was attributed to the uniform nanoparticle size (ca. 47 nm) and the large BET surface area (17.00 m(2)/g). Next, the hydrothermal synthesised STO nanoparticles were successfully deposited onto a FTO by using electrophoretic deposition (EPD). Interestingly, the STO nanoparticles photoelectrode deposited at 40 V for 120 s exhibited the highest photocurrent density of 1.05 mA/cm(2). This is because the STO nanoparticles have a good uniformity with the film thickness of 18.8 gm on FTO glass.

Here, we shed light on photoinduced halide demixing using in situ photoluminescence spectroscopy and in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) to directly compare the evolution of composition and phase changes in CH(NH2)(2) CsPb-halide (FACsPb-) and CH3NH3 Pb-halide (MAPb-) perovskites upon illumination, thereby providing insights into why FACs-perovskites are less prone to halide demixing than MA-perovskites. We find that halide demixing occurs in both materials. However, the I-rich domains formed during demixing accumulate strain in FACsPb-perovskites but readily relax in MA-perovskites. The accumulated strain energy is expected to act as a stabilizing force against halide demixing and may explain the higher Br composition threshold for demixing to occur in FACsPb-halides. In addition, we find that while halide demixing leads to a quenching of the high-energy photoluminescence emission from MA-perovskites, the emission is enhanced from FACs-perovskites. This behavior points to a reduction of nonradiative recombination centers in FACs-perovskites arising from the demixing process and buildup of strain. FACsPb-halide perovskites exhibit excellent intrinsic material properties with photoluminescence quantum yields that are comparable to MA-perovskites.

However, the performance of 1.80-1.85 eV E-g perovskite solar cells (PVKSCs) are significantly lagging their counterparts in the 1.60-1.75 eV E-g range. This is because the photovoltage (V-oc) does not proportionally increase with E-g due to lower optoelectronic quality of conventional (MA,FA,Cs)Pb(I,Br)(3) and results in a photovoltage plateau (V(oc )limited to 80% of the theoretical limit for similar to 1.8 eV E-g). Here, we incorporate phenyl-ethylammonium (PEA) in a mixed-halide perovskite composition to solve the inherent material-level challenges in 1.80-1.85 eV E-g perovskites. The amount of PEA incorporation governs the topography and optoelectronic properties of resultant films. Detailed structural and spectroscopic characterization reveal the characteristic trends in crystalline size, orientation, and charge carrier recombination dynamics and rationalize the origin of improved material quality with higher luminescence. With careful interface optimization, the improved material characteristics were translated to devices and V-oc values of 1.30-1.35 V were achieved, which correspond to 85-87% of the theoretical limit. Using an optimal amount of PEA incorporation to balance the increase in V-oc and the decrease in charge collection, a highest power conversion efficiency of 12.2% was realized. Our results clearly overcome the photovoltage plateau in the 1.80-1.85 eV E-g range and represent the highest V-oc achieved for mixed-halide PVKSCs.

Current state-of-the-art technologies including transparent heat reflecting mirror (THM), thermo-chromic (TC), transparent solar cells (TSC), and luminescent based materials have been discussed. The coating performance primarily depends on the selection of materials, surface and structural morphology, dielectric passivation growth process and architecture of the multi layered structure. The micro-structural properties of thin metal/metal oxide layer, and its impact on the heat reflecting coating have been studied extensively. Growth of high quality continuous thin film with fewer defects is an essential part of the infrared reflecting and/or heat regulating coatings. Henceforth, in this review, detailed analysis of growth of continuous and thin metal layer influence of the seed layer (germanium and nickel) and doping on the growth mechanism of thin metal have been discussed. Surface morphology and electronic properties of metal layer/multi-layered coatings have been studied in detail for THR applications. A wide range of metal oxides and their physical properties have been considered for use as passivation layer in the THR coating structure. Among several THR structures, the architecture comprising of dielectric-metal-dielectric (DMD) stack is known to exhibit the best heat reflecting performances. While the metal component typically comprises of silver (Ag), copper (Cu), and nitride based materials, dielectrics are made from metal oxides such as BaSnO3, TiO2, SnO2, ZnO, HfO2, Cu2O, and ZrO2. Selection of passivation layer and tuning of micro-structural properties are very crucial to enhance the visible transmittance without sacrificing infrared reflectance. Optical properties of the dielectric layer can be controlled with growth mechanism and varying content of impurity dopant. Metal doped dielectrics play a key role to enhance the visible light transmission while maintaining infra-red reflection. Through in-situ materials engineering, crystal quality of the dielectric improves which has significant role on the THR performance. Furthermore, impact of rapid thermal annealing (RTA) technique to improve crystal quality of metal oxides without oxidizing the thin metal layer is also emphasized. In the subsequent sections, synthesis of thin films by using sputtering methods, thermal evaporation and e-beam evaporation methods using inexpensive materials for large scale deployment of coating have been discussed. Neutral colored Cu-based THR smart windows is developed through tuning the structural property of TiO2. The simulated Cu-based THR window shows >= 10 degrees C temperature reduction when compared to conventional glass based windows. Thermal stability of copper and silver based multilayer enhanced through ultra-thin metal and dielectric interface engineering. Transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) are also an essential candidate for the wide band gap semiconductor based THR application. Recent progress in TCOs material has been briefly discussed in one of the section of the review. Hetero-epitaxy of metal oxides (ITO/ZnO) shows promising characteristics as heat insulating materials. Impact of growth process and surface morphology of the TCO have been studied to evaluate the performance of the TCO as heat insulating materials. In addition, advanced hybrid composite based heat reflector coatings for energy efficient building applications is also highlighted in the later section of the review. The industrial utilization and efficacy of heat reflector metal oxides, when incorporated into polymeric/pigments/fibers and heat reflecting durable paints as advanced hybrid composites coatings has been discussed. The progression of solution based metal nanowire (MNW) and optical properties for the heat regulating applications have been included. Dielectric/metal-NW/dielectric multilayer can be a potential candidate for the development of low cost THR film. The solution based THR methods has potential to be mass customized in economic ways and can be viable at industrial scale. Thermo-chromic materials are also considered as prospective candidate for the transparent coating applications. Recent development of VO2 bilayer, trilayer, micro-pattern and nano-plate films have been discusses to enhance the luminous transmittance and solar modulation ability. Transparent solar cells, based on the infra-red absorption through up-conversion nanoparticles are viable candidates for the development of environmental friendly heat regulating systems. Recent advancement of inorganic, polymer, perovskite, and luminescent based transparent solar cell (TSCs) with heat reflecting mirror have been evaluated for smart windows applications. For the deployment of large scale THR film, low cost materials, roll-to-roll (R2R) sputter and atmospheric pressure chemical vapour deposition (APCVD) have been assessed for the industrial applicability. The progression of THR materials with thermo-chromics, self-cleaning and TSCs materials can enhance the overall performance of the smart/transparent coatings for thermal management and heat regulating functionalities.

Although the power conversion efficiency (PCE) reaches over 22%, severe current-voltage hysteresis in perovskite solar cells has been issues. To solve the hysteresis, we report here on interfacial engineering via post-treatment of perovsklte films with phenylalkylammonium iodide. The 145 degrees C-annealed FA(.9)Cs(.1)PbI(2.9)Br(.1) perovskite films are post-treated with series of phenylalkylammonium iodides with chemical formula of (C6H5)CnH2n(NH2I), where effects of concentration and solvent on photovoltaic performance and hysteresis are systematically investigated. For n = 2 phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAT), hysteresis is reduced by PEAT treatment but there is optimal concentration to minimize the hysteresis. Average PCE, estimated from reverse and forward scanned data, of 15.94% before PEAT treatment is improved to 17.62% after 4 mM PEAT treatment mainly due to increase in average FF from 0.696 to 0.751. At higher concentration of 10 mM, average PCE is declined again to 15.60% due to the large difference in FF between reverse and forward scan. Post-treatment with PEAT increases carrier life time from 500 ns (pristine) to 795 ns, which is responsible for the reduced hysteresis. Longer alkyl chain such as PEAT (n = 2) is found to be better to reduce the hysteresis than shorter one like PAT (n = 0) because of longer carrier life time, which indicates that dipole moment of phenylalkylammonium iodide is involved in time-dependent charge extraction.",,,,"Park, Nam-Gyu/F-2477-2014",,,,,,,,,,,,,0927-0248,1879-3398,,,,1-Jun,2018,179,,,,,,57,65,,10.1016/j.solmat.2018.02.015,,,,,,,,WOS:000428483600008,,,,,

After simulating the initial structure of FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD solar cell, the hole transport layer Spiro-OMeTAD thickness was optimized on a small scale using modeling.

This review focuses on formability of lead-free organic-inorganic halide perovskite, alternative metal cations candidates to replace lead (Pb), and possible substitutions of organic cations, as well as halide anions in the lead-free organic-inorganic halide perovskite architecture.

It has been theoretically shown for GaAs solar cells that with the combined effects of a surface random texturing and a perfectly reflecting rear mirror, efficiencies close to the Shockley Queisser limit can be reached, even when the absorber layer is very thin. In here, we demonstrate a method for taking advantage of surface random texturing to enhance the efficiency of planar perovskite solar cells. By naturally transferring the perovskite random nano texturing to the back semiconductor/metal interface, where the contrast in the imaginary part of the refractive index is very large, backscattering reduces light escape from the solar cell structure.

Specifically, we investigate the structural phase transitions of PEA(2)MnCl(4) (PEA = phenethylamine) using temperature dependent single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, including the symmetry analysis of the observed space groups. Our results show that PEA(2)MnCl(4) transforms from a high-temperature centrosymmetric structure with space group I4/mmm to a low-temperature polar Pca2(1) phase via an intermediate phase with polar space group Aea2. We study the mechanism responsible for the I4/mmm to Aea2 polar phase transition and find that it is different from previously proposed mechanisms in similar systems. The transition is governed by the opening of a small dihedral angle between the phenyl ring planes of two adjacent PEA molecules, which consequently become crystallographically inequivalent in the Aea2 phase. This molecular rotation induces a significant difference in the lengths of the ethylammonium tails of the two molecules, which coordinate the inorganic layer asymmetrically and are consequently involved in different hydrogen bonding patterns. Consequently, the negatively charged chlorine octahedron that coordinates the Mn(2+)cation deforms. This deformation moves the Mn2+ off-center along the out-of-plane-axis, contributing to the polar nature of the structure. Notably, the polar axis is out-of-plane with respect to the inorganic sheets. This is in contrast to other layered organic-inorganic hybrids as well as conventional layered perovskites, such as the Aurivillius phases, where in-plane polarization is observed. Our findings add to the understanding of possible mechanisms that can induce ferroelectric behavior in layered organic-inorganic hybrids.

Photoexcitation of the spiro-fluorene-xanthene X60 populates its S1 state which decays via intersystem crossing (ISC) as well as fluorescence and internal conversion on a nanosecond time scale. Photoexcitation of the PTAA polymer leads to the formation of singlet excitons which relax and migrate in the time regime from a few to about a hundred picoseconds and decay to the ground state with a lifetime of ca. 900 ps. Both X60 and PTAA exhibit efficient photoinduced electron injection into mesoporous TiO2 thin films forming radical cations with characteristic spectral bands, as confirmed by spectroelectrochemistry in solution. Photoluminescence (PL) experiments performed for the HTMs on methylammonium lead iodide perovskite deposited on mesoporous TiO2 show that small molecular HTMs, such as X60, quench the PL much better than the PTAA polymer. Ultrafast transient absorption experiments on the other hand suggest that the hole transfer at the interface between the perovskite and these HTMs is very fast, regardless of the type of HTM. It is therefore concluded that small molecular HTMs infiltrate much better into mesoporous structures and therefore more efficiently accept holes from the perovskite on such thin film architectures due to the better interfacial contact compared with their polymer-based counterparts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1474-905X,1474-9092,,,,1-Jun,2018,17,6,,,,,722,733,,10.1039/c8pp00030a,,,,,,,,WOS:000435358900004,29722399,,,,

After the appearance of planar hetero-junction type PSCs, the power generation mechanism has been argued. Around that time, several issues arose, such as I-V hysteresis and chloride contents. Although there were several severe comments about these issues, the developments of the PSCs progressed steadily, then efficiencies over 20% were reported.

In this work we probe the band-edge and sub-gap energy states within polycrystalline and single crystal perovskites to better understand their photophysical origins. Through temperature-, excitation intensity- and time-dependent optical measurements, we reveal the existence of both free and bound exciton contributions to the optoelectronic properties across a wide temperature region up to 300 K. The low-energy absorption and multiple-peak emission phenomena, whose physics origins have been highly controversial before, are caused by these exciton states. Furthermore, the trapping and recombination dynamics of these excitons is shown to be strongly dependent on the structural phase of the perovskite. The orthorhombic phase exhibits an ultrafast exciton trapping and distinct trap emissions, while the tetragonal phase gives low monomolecular recombination velocity and capture cross-sections (approximate to 10(-18) cm(2)). Within the multiphonon transition scenario, this suppression in charge trapping is caused by the increase in the charge capture activation energy due to a reduction in electron-lattice interactions within the inorganic framework, which can reasonably interpret the unexpectedly long carrier lifetime in these material systems. These findings provide a clearer understanding of the origins of the photophysical properties of perovskite materials, and the discovery of a high-temperature-stable bound exciton would bring the excitonic feature to be a concern for the perovskite energy conversion and utilization applications.",,,,,"Jasieniak, Jacek/0000-0002-1608-6860",,,,,,,,,,,,1754-5692,1754-5706,,,,1-Jun,2018,11,6,,,,,1460,1469,,10.1039/c7ee03543h,,,,,,,,WOS:000435351000009,,,,,

While a textured surface topology has potential benefits for light scattering, a smooth surface is desirable to enable the pinhole-free deposition of contact layers. We show that the highly textured morphology made by popular antisolvent conversion methods arises because of in-plane compressive stress experienced during the intermediate phase of film formation where the substrate constrains the film from expanding leading to energy release in the form of wrinkling, resulting in trenches that can be hundreds of nanometers deep with periods of several micrometers.

Following pioneering works, we found that the conversion process from PbI2 to perovskite mainly involves diffusion, infiltration, contact and reaction. In order to facilitate the conversion from PbI2 to perovskite, we demonstrate an effective method to regulate supersaturation level (the driving force to crystallization) of PbI2 by solventing-out crystallization combining with subsequent time-delay thermal annealing of PbI2 wet film. Enough voids and spaces in resulting porous PbI2 layer will be in favor of efficient diffusion, infiltration of CH3NH3I solution, and further enhance the contact and reaction between PbI2 and CH3NH3I in the whole film, leading to rapid, efficient and complete perovskite conversion with a conversion level of about 99.9%. Enhancement of light harvesting ranging from visible to near-IR region was achieved for the resultant high-quality perovskite. Upon this combined method, the fabricated mesostructured solar cells show tremendous power conversion efficiency (PCE) improvement from 3.2% to about 12.3% with less hysteresis owing to the simultaneous enhancement of short-circuit photocurrent density (J(sc)), open-circuit voltage (V-oc) and fill factor (FF).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2053-1591,,,,,JUN,2018,5,6,,,,,,,66404,10.1088/2053-1591/aabe13,,,,,,,,WOS:000434487800001,,,,,

Many of the highest efficiency devices reported to date have used complex perovskite formulations synthesized from PbI2, formamidinium iodide, PbBr2, and CH3NH3Br; the addition of a small amount of CsI to this composition can further improve the device efficiency. Unfortunately, previous work has also shown that the methylammonium cation can not only make the perovskite more hygroscopic, it also renders it susceptible to photochemical decomposition; additionally, mixed-halide perovskite compositions have been shown to suffer from a phenomenon known as halide segregation. Here we show that both PbBr2 and CH3NH3Br can be omitted from Cs-containing perovskite devices with little change in device efficiency. We also show that replacing these components with PbI2 and guanidinium iodide leads to a decrease in the trap state density and an increase in the open-circuit voltage.

Investigation of alternatives perovskite processing methods are hence key to safely upscale the perovskite photovoltaic manufacturing. In this manuscript we use the Hansen theory to find suitable nonhazardous solvents to solubilize two lead salts, PbBr2 and PbI2, used to fabricate the corresponding methylammonium (MA) lead halide perovskite films. The method is based on the use of the Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs) of a lead salt and a solvent to provide insight into whether interactions between them are favorable or not. We first studied the solubility properties of each lead salt (PbBr2 and PbI2) by determining experimentally their Hansen solubility spheres. Using these results, computer simulations allow us to determine compatible nonhazardous solvents with these two compounds in terms of solubility.
