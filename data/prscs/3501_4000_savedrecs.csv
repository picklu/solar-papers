The addition of BAI altered significantly the orientation of crystal growth and improved the connectivity of the crystal grains, but the existence of pinholes in the surface of the pristine FASnI(3) films was unavoidable; this effect impeded further improvement of the device performance (PCE 5.5%), which is nevertheless superior to that of a pristine FASnI(3) film (PCE 4.0%). The addition of EDAI(2) had the effect of curing the pinhole problem, passivating the surface defect states, preventing Sn2+/Sn4+ oxidation and inducing slow relaxation of the crystal structure. In the presence of the EDAI(2) additive (1%), the FASnI(3) device attained the best initial efficiency, 7.4%, and the device performance continuously increased as a function of duration of storage; the maximum PCE, 8.9%, was obtained for a device stored in a glove box for over 1400 h with only slight degradation for storage beyond 2000 h.

We have developed a method based on Kelvin probe force microscopy that enables mapping charge redistribution in an operating device upon a voltage- or light pulse with sub-millisecond resolution. We observed the formation of a localized interfacial charge at the anode interface, which screened most of the electric field in the cell. The formation of this charge happened within 10 ms after applying a forward voltage to the device. After switching off the forward voltage, however, these interfacial charges were stable for over 500 ms and created a reverse electric field in the cell. This reverse electric field directly explains higher photocurrents during reverse bias scans by electric field-assisted charge carrier extraction. Although we found evidence for the presence of mobile ions in the perovskite layer during the voltage pulse, the corresponding ionic field contributed only less than 10% to the screening. Our observation of a time-dependent ion concentration in the perovskite layer suggests that iodide ions adsorbed and became neutralized at the hole-selective spiro-OMeTAD electrode. We thereby show that instead of the slow migration of mobile ions, the formation and the release of interfacial charges is the dominating factor for current-voltage hysteresis.",,,,"Berger, Rudiger/A-5210-2009; Tress, Wolfgang/B-7171-2017; Weber, Stefan A.L./F-1508-2013; Turren-Cruz, Silver-Hamill/U-1495-2019","Tress, Wolfgang/0000-0002-4010-239X; Weber, Stefan A.L./0000-0003-3052-326X; Turren-Cruz, Silver-Hamill/0000-0003-3191-6188; Hermes, Ilka/0000-0001-5659-1290",,,,,,,,,,,,1754-5692,1754-5706,,,,1-Sep,2018,11,9,,,,,2404,2413,,10.1039/c8ee01447g,,,,,,,,WOS:000445215400032,,,,,

Here we show that a thin layer of a functional hygroscopic polymer, poly(ethylene oxide), PEO, on top of the perovskite thin film, can make perovskite-based solar cells highly stable during operation and in a humid atmosphere. We prove that PEO chemically interacts with lead ions on the perovskite surface, and thus passivates undercoordinated defect sites. Importantly, defect healing by PEO not only results in an improvement of the photo-voltage but also makes the perovskite thin film stable. We demonstrate that the hygroscopic PEO thin film can prevent water inclusion into the perovskite film by screening water molecules, thus having a multi-functional role. Overall, such interface engineering leads to highly durable perovskite solar cells, which, in the presence of PEO passivation, retained more than 95% of their initial power conversion efficiency over 15 h illumination, under load, in ambient atmosphere without encapsulation.

The cell stacks two identical series-connected double-junction perovskite/silicon tandem cells with a common (middle) terminal such that the bottom tandem cell is integrated upside down to effectively harvest albedo. The albedo absorption in the bottom tandem cell linearly enhances the short-circuit current of the double-tandem structure; hence, it overcomes the classical current-matching limit in series-connected tandem solar cells. We use self-consistent optical/device simulations to investigate the design optimizations of the cell and compare its performance with a conventional tandem structure. With an optimal design, the cell exhibits a remarkable efficiency of 30%-36% (bifacial gain of 10%-30%) for the albedo range of 15%-45%. The 3-T cell design works optimally for any range of albedo that is in contrast with 2-T series-connected cell for which the optimal top cell thickness changes with the value of albedo. Moreover, the proposed cell is relatively less sensitive to the process variations in the perovskite layer thickness.

It is noted that these two kinds of molecular modifications can significantly lower the HOMO level and improve the hole mobility, thus improving the hole injection from valence band of perovskite.

In some photoelectric materials, reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) from the triplet to the singlet state can enhance the quantum yield of photoluminescence greatly. In this study, our theoretical investigation indicated that the energy difference Delta E-st between the singlet state and the triplet state of CH3 NH3 PbI3 was less than 0.1 eV, which represents one crucial prerequisite for the occurrence of RISC. Meanwhile, the experimental results showed that the photoluminescence lifetime increased with the increasing temperature, a typical feature of RISC.

To understand the aging effects in PSCs is mandatory to rationally design implemented architectures and materials combining a viable deposition process, efficiency and stability. Despite of this evidence, only few experimental works succeeded in the direct quantitative characterization of aging effects in PSCs. In this work, we apply state-of-the-art X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profile analysis and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) 3D imaging to investigate the light-induced degradation of layers and interfaces in reference (Au/Spiro-OMeTAD/CH3NH3PbI3/m-TiO2/cTiO(2)/FTO) and interface-engineered mesoscopic PSCs in which graphene flakes are added into the mesoscopic TiO2 layer and a solution-processed 2H-MoS2 flakes buffer layer is added at the SpiroOMeTAD/CH3NH3PbI3 interface. Results show that the graphene addition into the mesoscopic TiO2 layer improves the stability of the PSC by reducing the locally-inhomogeneous light-induced back-conversion of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer into PbIx and PbOx species and the consequent release of iodine species, which diffuse across the interfaces and causes the modifications at the gold electrode (Au-I bonding) and the mesoscopic TiO2 (Ti-I bonding) interfaces. Moreover, where the CH3NH3PbI3 layer is preserved the gold diffusion across the entire device structure is strongly reduced even after the aging. The 2H-MoS2 flakes buffer layer allows limiting the localized diffusion of gold and the iodine diffusion in as-prepared PSCs while it is rather ineffective in preventing light-induced aging effects. Overall, thanks to the lower average degradation of the layers and interfaces, interface engineered PSCs could retain similar to 60% of their initial PCE after the aging respect to less than similar to 25% in the reference cells.

Advancements in nanotechnology and availability of better infrastructures for PSCs research have accelerated this field leading to the dramatic rise in efficiency with expectations of commercialization soon. Amongst other solar cell devices, PSCs have demonstrated record efficiencies exceeding 22% off late in just a few years establishing as the fastest growing solar PV technology. This extremely rapid progress in PSCs is not only because of unique properties of perovskite materials in the devices but also due to engineering and modification of other components as well as device architecture facilitating the conducive microstructure and interfaces to result in higher power conversion efficiencies. These other components such as electron transport materials (ETMs) and hole transport materials (HTMs) not only play a vital role in determining the device efficiency but also the stability of PSCs. This review focuses on the recent investigations carried out to achieve high performance and long term stability of PSCs, with primarily focus on doping or composition engineering of various components of PSCs devices (perovskite, ETM and HTM) resulting in enhanced properties with respect to their role in delivering high performance PSCs. Although, a great deal of research has been carried out and reviewed on PSCs, investigations correlating material compositions and properties vis-a-vis increase in the efficiency and enhancement in the stability, although very interesting, are rarely reviewed. Hence, this review focuses on the recent developments and critical issues related to microstructure, properties and stability of the devices resulting from doping or composition engineering. In this article, first a basic introduction to PSCs and perovskite as materials for PV devices is followed by the role and importance of ETM and HTM. The article further reviews in-detail about doping and compositional engineering in ETM, HTM and perovskite material in order to improve the PSC device performance. Finally, the article will provide an outlook towards various issues requiring further attention which can help in eventually facilitating technological promise of PSCs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, perovskite materials with two different morphologies, compact (c-perovskite) and nanowires (nw-perovskite), were prepared with a simple two-step spin coating solution process and their photovoltaic properties were investigated. We found that the presence of partially grown perovskite nanowires in the photoactive layer results in an excellent photovoltaic performance, i.e. a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.7%. The shape and size of the perovskite nanowires are controlled by varying the concentration of N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) in the methylammonium iodide (MAI) solution and keeping constant all other processing parameters such as the spin-coating speed and the annealing temperature. The optimal nw-perovskite film exhibits better light harvesting properties in the visible region, improved charge separation, and high charge carrier mobility. The mechanisms of charge carrier transfer in the two type of perovskites and their recombination dynamics were investigated by performing time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements respectively. Further, with an additional approach, the morphologies and solar cell performances of the c-perovskite and nw-perovskite films are improved by the addition of a fullerene derivative (PC60BM).

However, the energy barrier at the interface between the PCBM layer and the metal electrode, which is due to an energy level mismatch, limits the electron extraction ability. In this work, an inorganic aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) interlayer is inserted between the PCBM layer and the metal electrode so that electrons can be collected efficiently by the electrode. It is shown that with the help of the PCBM/AZO bilayer, the power conversion efficiency of PSCs is significantly improved, with negligible hysteresis and improved device stability. The UPS measurement shows that the AZO interlayer can effectively decrease the energy offset between PCBM and the metal electrode. The steady state photoluminescence, time-resolved photoluminescence, transient photocurrent, and transient photovoltage measurements show that the PSCs with the AZO interlayer have a longer radiative carrier recombination lifetime and more efficient charge extraction efficiency.

The plasmonic resonance wavelength is selected to be very close to the spectrum range of lower absorption of the perovskite: around 600 nm. Both gold and silver nanoparticles (Au and Ag NPs) are selected to introduce the plasmonic effect with diameters above 40 nm, to get an overlap between the plasmonic resonance spectrum and the requested lower absorption spectrum of the perovskite layer. Simulations show the increase in the short circuit current density (J(sc)) as a result of adding Au and Ag NPs, respectively. Enhancement in J(sc) is observed as the diameter of both Au and Ag NPs is increased beyond 40 nm. Furthermore, there is a slight increase in the reflection loss as the thickness of the plasmonic nanoparticles at the rear side of the solar cell is increased.

We also analyze the cost of solution-phase ligand exchange for preparing deposition-ready PbS QD inks, as well as the manufacturing cost for roll-to-roll solution-processed PV modules using these materials. We find that present QD synthesis costs are prohibitively high for PV applications, with median costs of 11 to 59 $ per g for PbS QDs (0.15 to 0.84 $ per W for a 20% efficient cell) and 73 $ per g for CsPbI3 QDs (0.74 $ per W).

In general, an interface (tunnelling or recombination) layer is usually required for electrical contact between the top and the bottom cells, which incurs higher fabrication costs and parasitic absorption. Most of the monolithic perovskite/Si tandem cells demonstrated use a hetero-junction silicon (Si) solar cell as the bottom cell, on small areas only. This work is the first to successfully integrate a low temperature processed (<= 150 degrees C) planar CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cell on a homo-junction silicon solar cell to achieve a monolithic tandem without the use of an additional interface layer on large areas (4 and 16 cm(2)). Solution processed SnO2 has been effective in providing dual functions in the monolithic tandem, serving as an ETL for the perovskite cell and as a recombination contact with the n-type silicon homo-junction solar cell that has a boron doped p-type (p++) front emitter. The SnO2/p++ Si interface is characterised in this work and the dominant transport mechanism is simulated using Sentaurus technology computer-aided design (TCAD) modelling. The champion device on 4 cm(2) achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.0% under reverse-scanning with a V-OC of 1.68 V, a J(SC) of 16.1 mA cm(-2) and a high FF of 78% yielding a steady-state efficiency of 20.5%. As our monolithic tandem device does not rely on the SnO2 for lateral conduction, which is managed by the p++ emitter, up scaling to large areas becomes relatively straightforward. On a large area of 16 cm(2), a reverse scan PCE of 17.6% and a steady-state PCE of 17.1% are achieved. To our knowledge, these are the most efficient perovskite/homo-junction-silicon tandem solar cells that are larger than 1 cm(2).

We find that SOC enhances contributions of Pb(p(x)) and Pb(p(y)) orbitals to the conduction and valence bands. As a result, the KS orbitals become more sensitive to nuclear motions, leading to the increased nonadiabatic couplings. Consequently, SOC greatly speeds up the electron and hole relaxation, making the computed relaxation time scales consistent with available experiments.

It is proposed that this unique structure originates from a rare combination of conditions: strong anisotropy in surface energy between different facets arising from the primitive ionic crystal of CsI, the strong water-breaking property of cesium ions and an unusual effect of mesoporous substrates in preventing premature nucleation.",,,,"Paz, Yaron/Q-7957-2019","Paz, Yaron/0000-0002-8161-1123",,,,,,,,,,,,0040-6090,,,,,1-Sep,2018,661,,,,,,108,115,,10.1016/j.tsf.2018.07.003,,,,,,,,WOS:000440074500016,,,,,

In this work, we solve the same differential equations numerically to model the carrier decay in the large signal domain extending over five orders of carrier density. Since the surface voltage is linked to the carrier density by a logarithmic relation, we express the carrier decay as surface photovoltage transients.

We further identify that trimethyl aluminum, a strongly Lewis acid, reacts readily with C=O on PCBM to generate a seeding layer for nucleating ZnO ALD. This new chemical route is highly reliable and can be used to synthesize ALD ZnO coatings over PCBM.

In this work, MAPbCl(x)Br(3-x) NPs with cross-linkable and polymerizable ligands are successfully prepared as new emissive cross-linkers for polymer networks. Commercially available reagent 2-aminoethyl methacrylate hydrochloride (AMHCl) can act as a ligand to stabilize MAPbBr(3) NPs in solution.

A key aspect of defect tolerance is the shallow character of dominant intrinsic defects. However, while qualitative heuristics to identify other defect-tolerant materials have been proposed, in particular, the presence of a partially oxidized ns(2) cation such as Pb, no compelling comprehensive understanding of how these shallow defects arise has yet emerged. Using modern defect theory and defect calculations, we conduct a detailed investigation of the mechanisms and identify specific features related to the chemical composition and crystal structure that give rise to defect tolerance. We find that an ns(2) cation is necessary but not sufficient to guarantee shallow cation vacancies in an s-p system, and that a compound's crystal structure can ensure shallow anion vacancies in a variety of ways. Specifically, the crystal site symmetry can enforce weak interactions between the orbitals that form the defect states, thus ensuring that those defect states are shallow.

This is mainly due to the fact that the surface of PET/ITO is rougher than glass/ITO. ITO bulges could cause the upper perovskite crystals to deteriorate, eventually leading to a large leakage current and the low performance of devices. We reduce the leakage current of PET/ITO assembled PSCs by two measures to improve the PCE of the flexible PSCs. First, double hole transport layers of PEDOT:PSS/NiO are deposited on the surface of PET/ITO, that is, a layer of PEDOT:PSS film is first spin-coated on the ITO surface and then a layer of NiO film is evaporated above to cover the small bulges on the bare ITO. Second, the dual additives of DIO and H2O were introduced to the perovskite precursor solution to control the process of crystal formation and grain growth of the perovskite absorber, finally improving the uniformity and sizes of the perovskite crystals. In conclusion, the double hole transport layers and CH3NH3PbI3-xClx perovskites with dual additives produced a perovskite film with low roughness, high uniformity and large crystal grains on PET/ITO, finally achieving flexible PSCs with the best PCE of 18.0% and excellent flexibility.

Compared to MAPbI(3), FAPbI(3) has shown an elevated decomposition temperature and a slower decomposition process and therefore it is considered as a more promising candidate for future high-efficiency and reliable optoelectronic devices. However, these excellent optoelectronic properties only exist in the alpha phase and this phase will spontaneously transform into an undesired delta phase with much poorer optoelectronic properties regardless of the environment. This is the main challenge for the application of the FAPbI(3) perovskite. Herein, we report a novel strategy to stabilize the cubic black phase of FAPbI(3) by using nanoengineering templates. Without further treatment, the black phase can be held over 7 months under ambient conditions and 8 days in an extreme environment with a Relative Humidity (RH) of 97%. A systematic study further reveals that this great improvement can be attributed to the spatial confinement in anodized alumina membrane (AAM) nanochannels, which prohibits the unwanted alpha-to-delta phase transition by restricting the expansion of NWs in the ab plane, and the excellent passivation against water molecule invasion.

The incorporation of [BMIM]BF4 not only paves the interface contact between PCBM and electrode, but also facilitates the electron transport and extraction owing to the efficient passivation of the surface trap states. Moreover, [BMIM]BF4 with excellent thermal stability can act as a protective layer by preventing the erosion of moisture and oxygen into the perovskite layer. The resulting devices present a record indoor power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 35.20% under fluorescent lamps of 1000 lux, and an impressive PCE of 19.30% under 1 sun illumination.

The as-spun film consists of crystalline MA(2)PbI(3)Cl, which is composed of one-dimensional chains of lead halide octahedra, coexisting with disordered MACl. We show that the transformation of precursor into perovskite is not favored in the presence of MACl, and thus the gradual evaporation of MACl acts as a self-regulating mechanism to slow the conversion.

To this end, we propose a theoretical framework to calculate the open-circuit voltage enhancement resulting from photon recycling (Delta V-oc(PR)) with rigorous wave-optical treatment. It can be applied to both planar thin-film and nanostructured single-junction solar cells. We derive an explicit expression for Delta V-oc(PR), which reveals its dependence on internal quantum luminescence efficiency, parasitic reabsorption, and photon escape probabilities of reemitted photons. While the internal quantum luminescence efficiency is an intrinsic material property, both latter quantities can be determined rigorously for an arbitrary solar cell architecture by three-dimensional electrodynamic dipole emission calculations. We demonstrate the strengths and validity of our framework by determining the impact of photon recycling on the V-oc, of a conventional planar organometal halide perovskite thin-film solar cell and compare it to established reference cases with perfect antireflection and Lambertian light scattering. Our calculations reveal Delta V-oc(PR) values of up to 80 mV for the considered device stack in the absence of angular restriction and up to 240 mV when the escape cone above the cell is restricted to theta(out) = 2.5 degrees around the cell normal. These improvements impose severe constraints on the parasitic absorption as a parasitic reabsorption probability of only 2% reduces the Delta V-oc(PR) to 100 mV for the same angular restriction.

Surface manipulation of metal halide perovskite (MHP) QDs has proven particularly challenging in comparison to that of more established inorganic materials due to dynamic surface species and low material formation energy; most conventional methods of chemical manipulation targeted at the MHP QD surface will result in transformation or dissolution of the MHP crystal. In previous work, we have demonstrated record-efficiency QD solar cells (QDSCs) based on ligand-exchange procedures that electronically couple MHP QDs yet maintain their nanocrystalline size, which stabilizes the corner-sharing structure of the constituent PbI64- octahedra with optoelectronic properties optimal for solar energy conversion. In this work, we employ a variety of spectroscopic techniques to develop a molecular-level understanding of the MHP QD surface chemistry in this system. We individually target both the anionic (oleate) and cationic (oleylammonium) ligands. We find that atmospheric moisture aids the process by hydrolysis of methyl acetate to generate acetic acid and methanol. Acetic acid then replaces native oleate ligands to yield QD surface-bound acetate and free oleic acid. The native oleylammonium ligands remain throughout this film deposition process and are exchanged during a final treatment step employing smaller cations-namely, formamidinium. This final treatment has a narrow processing window; initial treatment at this stage leads to a more strongly coupled QD regime followed by transformation into a bulk MHP film after longer treatment.

Notably, the oxygen-induced defects in TiO2 have decreased to an acceptable level for PSCs due to the introduction of Er3+ ions. More interestingly, we find that a phase junction can be formed in the mixed crystalline rutile/anatase phase of TiO2, and this TiO2 phase junction can achieve efficient charge separation and accelerate internal electron transfer of the ETL. Taking advantage of these facts, we obtain TiO2-based PSCs through a two-step sequential deposition method in ambient air, whose best efficiency increases by 45.8%.

In this work, we explored antisolvent-free additive engineering to fabricate compact CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI(3)) perovskite films combining the coordination effect of methylammonium chloride (MACl) and methylammonium acetate (MAAc). The MACl coordination with organic and metal halides in the precursor solution resulted in the perovskite film having a large grain size and a single crystal-like cross-section profile (monolayer-like). The introduction of MAAc into the precursor solution reduced the perovskite film shrinkage after the film deposition, presumably due to an increased nucleation rate. Consequently, we succeeded in fabricating high-quality monolayer-like perovskite films with a micro-scale grain size (approximate to 2 m), a smooth surface and enhanced crystallinity. The time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectra and space-charge limited current (SCLC) measurements have confirmed that there was a significantly reduced density of trap states, which has an imminent impact on the perovskite film quality.

Cyclic voltammetry measurement revealed the matched energy levels of the TPE- based interlayers with perovskite materials. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra, time-resolved PL decay results and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) indicate the enhanced electron extraction and electron-transporting ability after introducing the TPE-DPP4/TPE-ISO4-based interlayer in PSCs.

The double-layer structure of TiO2 compact layer (c-TiO2) and a-SnO2 ETL leads to modification of interface energetics, resulting in improved charge collection and decreased carrier recombination in PSCs. The optimized device based on a-SnO2/c-TiO2 ETL shows a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.4% as compared to 19.33% for c-TiO2 based device.

The stability results show that the device on c-TiO2/a-SnO2 retains about 91% of its initial PCE value after 500 h light illumination, which is higher than pure c-TiO2 (67%) based devices.

To successfully transition PSC technology from the laboratory to industry scale, substantial efforts need to focus on scalable fabrication of high-performance perovskite modules with minimum negative environmental impact. Here, we provide an overview of the current research and our perspective regarding PSC technology toward future large-scale manufacturing and deployment.

Although intensive investigations are being made on their technical feasibility, serious analysis on the cost of perovskite-based tandem modules is lacking. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of solar modules is often used to evaluate technoeconomic competitiveness. Here, we performed a detailed cost analysis on two perovskite-based tandem modules (the perovskite/ c-silicon and the perovskite/ perovskite tandem module) compared with standard multi-crystalline silicon and single-junction perovskite solar cells. We found that perovskite PVs (both single junction and multi-junction) are competitive in the context of LCOE if the module lifetime is comparable with that of c-silicon solar cells.

We provide atomistic insight into the structure-property relationship of this NiO/OHP interface. The bulk (e.g., electronic structure) and device (e.g., photocurrent) properties were investigated. The interfacial band alignment is found to be strongly dependent on the lattice plane and the termination of MAPbI(3) due to the interfacial interactions. The increasing strength of interfacial interactions could decrease the valence band offset and increase the conduction band offset between NiO and MAPbI(3), which is beneficial for hole transporting and electron blocking. The device calculations (photocurrent density (J) at different bias voltage (V)) further suggest that the device performance could be improved by selecting the (001) lattice plane of MAPbI(3) and PbI2 -termination. The NiO(100)/MAPbI(3) (001)-PbI2 interface shows the best short circuit current density (J(SC)) and open circuit voltage (V-OC) among the studied interfaces.

However, it has been reported recently that the instability of lead halide perovskites, which are promising materials for high efficiency and low cost solar cells, can be improved by reducing the dimensions of the perovskites from the three-dimensional (3D) bulk to that of two-dimensional (2D) films. So far, there is a lack of general understanding about this unusual behavior, i.e., why a 2D slab cut out of the 3D bulk material could be more stable than the 3D material. Here, we carry out a systematic and comparative study on the thermodynamic stability of 2D and 3D perovskites using the first-principles method based on density functional theory. Taking CsPbBr3 and MAPbI(3) as prototype examples, we show that the thermodynamic stability of the 2D perovskite originates from the asymmetric surface properties of this material: the AX-terminated 2D APbX(3) are more stable than the PbX2-terminated 2D counterpart due to fewer surface dangling bonds. The MAI-terminated 2D MAPbI(3) becomes even more stable than its 3D counterpart due to relaxation of the hydrogen bonds at the surface.

Nevertheless, the characterization of the band tailing in experimental semiconductor crystals is generally difficult. In this paper, to determine the tail state generation in various solar cell materials, we have developed a quite general theoretical scheme in which the experimental Urbach energy is compared with the absorption edge energy derived from density-functional theory (DFT) calculation. For this purpose, the absorption spectra of solar cell materials, including CdTe, CuInSe2 (CISe), CuGaSe2 (CGSe), Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe), Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS), and hybrid perovskites, have been calculated by DFT particularly using very-high-density k meshes. As a result, we find that the tail state formation is negligible in CdTe, CISe, CGSe, and hybrid perovskite polycrystals. However, coevaporated CZTSe and CZTS layers exhibit very large Urbach energies, which are far larger than the theoretical counterparts. Based on DFT analysis results, we conclude that the quite large tail state formation observed in the CZTSe and CZTS originates from extensive cation disordering. In particular, even a slight cation substitution is found to generate unusual band fluctuation in CZTS(Se). In contrast, CH3NH3PBI3 hybrid perovskite shows the sharpest absorption edge theoretically, which agrees with experiment.",,,,"; Tampo, Hitoshi/M-3440-2018","Fujiwara, Hiroyuki/0000-0002-7605-0018; Tampo, Hitoshi/0000-0002-6666-0285",,,,,,,,,,,,2475-9953,,,,,10-Aug,2018,2,8,,,,,,,85404,10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.2.085404,,,,,,,,WOS:000441341700002,,,,,

Gravimetric studies reveal that diffusion of water vapor through a glassy polymer membrane is arrested by loading a hydrophobic form of GO (H-GO) in the polymer matrix, even as such, water inhibition cannot be realized by substantially increasing the thickness of the bare polymer. As an application, the ability of the coating to impede the degradation of methyl ammonium lead iodide films under high humidity conditions is demonstrated. At the same time the H-GO film has a resistance over 10(7) times higher when compared to thermally reduced GO of similar sp(2) fraction. We attribute this unique behavior to the presence of a sub-micron matrix of GO with simultaneous presence of large (similar to 9.5 angstrom) and small (similar to 4.7 angstrom) interlayer spacing.

In this work, transient absorption spectroscopy is used to directly track the photocarrier population in Cs2AgBiBr6 by measuring the ground state bleach dynamics. A small initial drop is resolved in the ground state bleach on a picosecond timescale, after which the remaining photocarriers decay monoexponentially with a lifetime of 1.4 mu s. The majority of the early-time decay is attributed to hot-carrier thermalization from the direct transition to the indirect bandgap, and the 1.4 mu s lifetime represents the recombination of most photocarriers.

In CsPbI3/CsSnI3 heterostructure, there are four kinds of electrical contacts, i.e., PbI2-SnI2, CsI-CsI, PbI2-CsI, and CsI-SnI2 interfaces. Large-cation anion displacements along z-direction are observed for all interface compositions, which indicate a strong ferroelectric field effect in the CsPbI3/CsSnI3 heterostructure. The net polarization displacements of PbI2 SnI2 and CsI-CsI interfaces are smaller than the values of PbI2-CsI and CsI-SnI2 interfaces. The interfacial ferroelectricity drives electron extraction from the perovskite and hinders electron-hole recombination by keeping the electrons and holes separated.

Ambient pressure exposure to BF3 solutions probed the reactivity of interfacial halides. Reactions with p-trifluorome-thylanilinium chloride probed the exchange reactivity of the At-site cation. A complex-forming ligand, 4,4'-bis-(trifluoromethyl)-2,2'-bipyridine, probed for interfacial B2+ site cations. Fluorine features in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) quantified reaction outcomes for each solution-phase species. XPS revealed adsorption of BF3, indicating surface-available halide anions on both MAPbI(3)(100) and on CsSnBr3. Temperature-programmed desorption quantified a similar to 200 kJ mol(-1) desorption activation energy from MAPbI(3)(100) and a similar to 215 kJ mol(-1) desorption energy from CsSnBr3. Adsorption of the fluorinated anilinium cation included no concomitant adsorption of chlorine as revealed by the absence of Cl 2p features within the limits of XPS detection. We interpret the observation of the anilinium species as exchanging for interfacial methylammonium species on MAPbI(3)(100) surfaces and interfacial cesium on the polycrystalline CsSnBr3 surface. Within detection limits, the bipyridine ligand demonstrated no adsorption to MAPbI(3)(100), suggestive of a Pb2+ deficient surface, but adsorption to the polycrystalline CsSnBr3 that suggests surface-accessible Sn2+.

Using in situ differential charging and transient photovoltage measurements, charge density and charge carrier recombination lifetime are determined under operational conditions. Increased V-oc is correlated to improved active layer crystallinity and a reduction in the density of trap states in MAPI.

The industrial sector requires an inevitable possibility of contacts between the halide perovskite materials and a number of atmospheric gases and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which could strongly influence the stability and charge transfer properties of perovskite-based optoelectronic devices. Understanding the interactions between various gas molecules and the perovskite layer could thus be of utmost importance to further optimize perovskite solar cells from an industrial perspective. Surprisingly, a systematic study of the interactions between gas molecules highlighting atmospheric and VOCs and the prototypical CH3NH3PbI3 surfaces is unavailable at the moment. Aiming to bridge the gap, we perform first principles and molecular dynamic calculations to investigate the interactions between CH3NH3PbI3 surfaces and gas molecules, employing CO, CO2, H-2, H2S, NH3, NO, NO2, O-2, and SO2 gas molecules as the adsorbates. Our study suggests that the NH3 gas molecules exhibit detrimental effects on the structural and optical properties of the perovskite material; consequently, halide perovskite solar cells should be strongly protected against these gases. However, the influences of gas molecules on the perovskite layer is not always undesirable, since NH3 molecules can strongly adsorb onto the perovskite surface, increasing the conductivity and initiating optical bleaching in the perovskite underlayer, leading to the viability of the halide perovskite materials as an effective gas sensor.

A broad range of experimental characterizations, including steady-state and time-resolved luminescence spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectra, and magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, reveal that the low PLQY in undoped NCs is associated with short-range disorder of the lattice induced by intrinsic defects such as halide vacancies and that Ni doping can substantially eliminate these defects and result in increased short-range order of the lattice. Density functional theory calculations reveal that Ni doping of perovskites causes an increase of defect formation energy and does not introduce deep trap states in the band gap, which is suggested to be the main reason for the improved local structural order and near-unity PLQY.

Two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy was applied to study a recently reported Pb-I-SCN layered perovskite. The Pb-I-SCN perovskite was spin-coated on a SiO2 surface as a thin film, with a thickness of similar to 100 nm, where the (SCN-)-C-12 anions were isotopically diluted with the ratio of (SCN)-C-12:(SCN)-C-13 = 5:95 to avoid vibrational coupling and excitation transfer between adjacent SCN- anions. The (CN)-C-12 stretch mode of the minor (SCN-)-C-12 component was the principal vibrational probe that reported on the structural evolution through 2D IR spectroscopy. Spectral diffusion was observed with a time constant of 4.1 +/- 0.3 ps. Spectral diffusion arises from small structural changes that result in sampling of frequencies within the distribution of frequencies comprising the inhomogeneously broadened infrared absorption band. These transitions among discrete local structures are distinct from oscillatory phonon motions of the lattice. To accurately evaluate the structural dynamics through measurement of spectral diffusion, the vibrational coupling between adjacent SCN- anions had to be carefully treated. Although the inorganic layers of typical 2D perovskites are structurally isolated from each other, the 2D IR data demonstrated that the layers of the Pb-I-SCN perovskite are vibrationally coupled. When both (SCN-)-C-12 and (SCN-)-C-13 were pumped simultaneously, cross-peaks between (SCN)-C-12 and (SCN)-C-13 vibrations and an oscillating 2D band shape of the (SCN-)-C-12 vibration were observed. Both observables demonstrate vibrational coupling between the closest SCN- anions, which reside in different inorganic layers. The thin films and the isotopic dilution produced exceedingly small vibrational echo signal fields; measurements were made possible using the near-Brewster's angle reflection pump-probe geometry.",,,,"UMEYAMA, Daiki/E-1617-2018","Umeyama, Daiki/0000-0003-4773-4020",,,,,,,,,,,,0002-7863,,,,,8-Aug,2018,140,31,,,,,9882,9890,,10.1021/jacs.8b03787,,,,,,,,WOS:000441475800015,30024160,,,,

All current high performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs), including the most recent world records, were achieved using the so-called anti-solvent method. Here, an anti-solvent, typically chlorobenzene (CB), is used to induce rapid crystallisation of a liquid perovskite precursor resulting in highly homogenous, pinhole-free planar perovskite films. While this has yielded very impressive high-performance results, few efforts have been dedicated to the fundamental understanding of the anti-solvent method. In this work, a systematic study is employed to understand the influence of anti-solvent treatment on both morphological and optoelectronic characteristics of PSCs. Perovskite absorber films were treated using CB and isopropanol (IPA) for comparing anti-solvents with different polarities. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) show that IPA treated perovskite films have a more uniform morphology with larger grains in comparison to CB processed perovskite films. Despite the improved morphology and solar cell performance the devices with IPA treated perovskites suffer from higher hysteresis during current density-voltage (J-V) scans. We found that this enhanced hysteresis stems mainly from higher charge accumulation at the TiO2/perovskite interface under illumination that could also lead to formation of excess electrostatic potential contributing to an increased open circuit voltage (V-oc). Our study provides a way for in-depth spectroscopic analysis methods aiding a deeper understanding of the interfacial charge characteristics and the fundamental mechanisms of PSCs.",,,,"Prochowicz, Daniel/I-2666-2018; Saliba, Michael/L-6581-2019","Prochowicz, Daniel/0000-0002-5003-5637; Saliba, Michael/0000-0002-6818-9781; Solanki, Ankur/0000-0002-8305-8536; Tavakoli, Mohammad Mahdi/0000-0002-8503-8889; Lab, Steiner/0000-0002-9834-2716",,,,,,,,,,,,2050-7488,2050-7496,,,,7-Aug,2018,6,29,,,,,14307,14314,,10.1039/c8ta03782e,,,,,,,,WOS:000443116700033,,,,,

Elemental mapping using electron microscopy revealed the NBSs to be areas with higher concentration of lead. We have looked at the possible mechanisms to explain NBSs and found that they may arise due to two very different pathways. The first one is due to crystal growth initiated by excess reactants and the second is due to chemical degradation of the QD surface. Further we have invoked the well known geometrical stability criterion for perovskites, Goldschmidt's tolerance factor to predict the appearance of NBSs and the onset of optical instability of CsPbBr3-xIx QDs.

The formula is examined by QCM measurements of sublimation of pi-conjugated organic molecules and direct counting of the deposited molecules one by one onto metal substrates, using ultrahigh vacuum low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).

It is verified that the IPNCs of CsPbX3 can be uniformly encapsulated within the polymer fibers with finely tuned compositions, by rationally adjusting the ratios of PbX2 and CsX salts in the raw solutions. Consequently, the photoluminescence (PL) emissions of CsPbX3@polymer fibers can be readily tuned to cover the whole visible range.

The mechanism of BPE is different from the typical p-n junction-based photovoltaic mechanism in heterogeneous materials. We survey the history, development and recent progress in understanding the mechanisms of BPE, with a focus on the shift current mechanism, an intrinsic BPE that is universal to all materials lacking inversion symmetry.

However, the size effect and surface effect restrict the applications of traditional bulk ferroelectric materials on a nanometer scale. Therefore the ferroelectric properties of low-dimensional nanomaterials have become an extensively studying subject in the field of material science.

We first give a concise outline of the basic theory, which relates to the existence of ferroelectricity. And then, we introduce the intrinsic ferroelectricity into two-dimensional materials. Many samples have been predicted, and the origin of ferroelectricity can be attributed to the soft modes of phonon, which leads to the ion displacements. Further, we discuss the ferroelectricity in covalent-modified two-dimensional materials. In such structures, the modified groups produce spontaneous electric dipoles, and lead to the macroscopical ferroelectricity. Therefore, we focus on how to design such structures, and the consequent ferreoelectricity.

Solar cells are regarded as one of the most promising candidates for generating renewable clean energy. Recently, a new class of semiconducting material called organic-inorganic halide perovskite has received great attention of academia, and the record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cell (PSC) rapidly increased from 3.8% in 2009 to 22.7% in late 2017 through intensive research due to some advantages as follows. 1) Excellent optoelectronic property. Perovskite materials exhibit excellent properties, including long diffusion length, high carrier mobility, and high absorption coefficient. 2) Low cost. The ingredients of perovskite materials are cheap, and PSCs can be manufactured by a solution process. 3) Tunable bandgap. Perovskite materials have highly tunable bandgap (1.2-2.2 eV), contributing to the further improvement in PCE of single junction PSCs by realizing the ideal bandgap (1.3-1.4 eV) as demonstrated by the Shockley-Queisser detailed balanced calculation. The basic architectures of PSCs are divided mainly into mesoscopic and planar heterojunction structures. Compared with the former configuration, the later configuration combined with low-temperature processable interlayers provides a method of fabricating flexible PSCs and tandem PSCs. Furthermore, the nonuse of the mesoscopic structure simplifies the structure of PSCs and reduces the cost and time of fabrication. The key requirement to achieve an efficient and reproducible planar heterojunction PSCs is that the perovskite layer should be uniform, continuous, and ""pinhole free"" to minimize ""shunting"" pathways. So, significant research effort is being devoted to the quality management of perovskite films with the goal of achieving the controllable preparation, including the optimization of their morphology (uniformity, coverage, roughness) and microstructure (grain size/distribution, texture), and the elimination of defects (voids, pinholes, grain boundaries), which influence the PSC performance directly. Especially for the one-step solution coating method, the film quality of perovskite on different planar substrates under varied deposition conditions exhibits a large difference, due to the complex crystallization process and the heightened sensitivity to environmental conditions. In this paper, the characteristics of perovskite materials, the nucleation-growth mechanism of films in the one-step solution method, and the evolution of cell structures are described briefly.

This inadequacy stems from a lack of a superior electron transport material (ETM) for fPSCs.

Choice of the most suitable solar cell structure is crucial to improve the performance further. Here, we attempt to determine an optimum cell structure for methyl-ammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)) perovskite sandwiched by TiO2 and spiro-OMeTAD layers, among planar heterojunction, mesoporous structure, and extremely thin absorber structure, by identifying and comparing charge carrier diffusion coefficients of the perovskite layer, interfacial charge transfer, and recombination rates using transient emission and absorption spectroscopies. An interfacial electron transfer from MAPbI(3) to compact TiO2 occurs with a time constant of 160 ns, slower than the perovskite photoluminescence (PL) lifetime (34 ns). In contrast, fast non-exponential electron injection to mesoporous TiO2 was observed with at least two different electron injection processes over different time scales; one (60-70%) occurs within an instrument response time of 1.2 ns and the other (30-40%) on nanosecond time scale, while most of hole injection (85%) completes in 1.2 ns. Analysis of the slow charge injection data revealed an electron diffusion coefficient of 0.016 +/- 0.004 cm(2) s(-1) and a hole diffusion coefficient of 0.2 +/- 0.02 cm(2) s(-1) inside MAPbI(3). To achieve an incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency of >80%, a minimum charge carrier diffusion coefficient of 0.08 cm(2) s(-1) was evaluated. An interfacial charge recombination lifetime was increased from 0.5 to 40 ms by increasing a perovskite layer thickness, suggesting that the perovskite layer suppresses charge recombination reactions. Assessments of charge injection and interfacial charge recombination processes indicate that the optimum solar cell structure for the MAPbI(3) perovskite is a mesoporous TiO2 based structure.

So far, organic hole transport (HT) materials have been extensively used in mesoscopic perovskite (n-i-p) solar cells for achieving high efficiency. Generally, organic hole transporters are expensive and exhibit low chemical stability. This often results in rapid degradation in the photon to electron conversion efficiencies. In this report, copper antimony sulfide (CAS, Cu12Sb4S13) tetrahedrite crystal phase nanoparticles capped with organic ligands are synthesized using a simple hot injection method. The ternary semiconductor nanoparticles exhibit high carrier concentration (3.4 X 10(18) cm(-3)) and electrical conductivity (0.043 Omega cm) with respect to the conventionally used organic HT, e.g., Spiro-OMeTAD. Additionally, appropriate conduction band and valence band positions in the CAS nanoparticles assist in efficient separation of the photogenerated holes from the perovskite materials and block the electrons from moving transport toward the counter metal contact. Incorporation of CAS in the MAPbI(3) perovskite solar cell as an HTL, assembled using an ambient fabrication process, achieves a power conversion efficiency of approximately 6.5%.

The chemical stability and solar cell performance are attributed to the synergetic effect of crystal phase stability and hydrophobic nature of the organic ligand capped CAS HTL layer.

The most common type of J-V hysteresis in PSCs is normal hysteresis, in which the performance in the reverse scan is better than that in the forward scan. However, inverted hysteresis also exists, in which the reverse scan performance is worse than in the forward scan; this hysteresis, however, is significantly less well studied. In this work, we show that the hysteresis decreases when the sweep rate is decreased only in cases involving a small bias range, and it does not decrease with a large bias range. Under large forward bias and slowing sweep rate, we observe enhanced normal hysteresis or inverted hysteresis in PSCs. Moreover, the degree of normal and inverted hysteresis can be adjusted by varying the bias. Here, we hypothesize that the tunable hysteresis is derived from the different distribution of ionic defects (V-I and V-MA) at the electron (hole) transport layer/perovskite interface due to ionic movement in the perovskite layer under the different bias scanning conditions. This conclusion is confirmed using Kelvin probe force microscopy with different bias voltages and scanning rates, which shows surface potential hysteresis based on ionic-migration-related Fermi level shifting in perovskite films and agrees with the tunable J-V hysteresis hypothesis. Moreover, the increased time response in the milliseconds region in open-circuit voltage decay after J-V scanning further corroborates the mechanism of ionic migration under bias.

Furthermore, the band gap of HPbI3-processed alpha-CsPbI3 is advantageously reduced from 1.72 to 1.68 eV due to the existence of tensile lattice strain. By employing such an alpha-CsPbI3 film in carbon-based perovskite solar cells (C-PSCs), a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.5% is achieved, which is a record value for the alpha-CsPbI3 PSCs without hole transport material.

However, PSCs are facing issues on stability, current-voltage hysteresis, ion migration, and so on, which should be solved for commercialization.

Thus, toward an S-Q limit efficiency of similar to 30% for PSCs with a light absorber having a band gap of 1.6 eV, a strategy of reducing nonradiative recombination and interface recombination to achieve a theoretical V-oc and FF is more important than finding a method to improve J(sc).

A fascinating methodology, utilizing quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), which involves the adsorption of PbI2 on the carbon surface, was employed to unravel this difference. QCM monitored adsorbed mass in real time and revealed that the mass of PbI2 on carbon layer increased with the increase in concentration of PbI2 in dimethylformamide (DMF). It was noticed that PbI2 was still adsorbed on the carbon surface even after rinsing with DMF, suggesting strong bonding of PbI2 with carbon.

However, the inherent large bandgap has restrained its working wavelength within 280-800 nm, while light at other regions, e.g., near-infrared (NIR), may cause drastic thermal heating effect that goes against the duration of OHP devices, if not properly exploited. Herein, a solution processable and large-scale synthesis of multifunctional OHP composites containing lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) is reported. Upon NIR illumination, the upconverted photons from UCNPs at 520-550 nm can be efficiently absorbed by closely surrounded OHP nanowires (NWs) and photocurrent is subsequently generated. The narrow full width at half maximum of the absorption of rare earth ions (Yb3+ and Er3+) has ensured high-selective NIR response. Lifetime characterizations have suggested that Forster resonance energy transfer with an efficiency of 28.5% should be responsible for the direct energy transfer from UCNPs to OHP NWs.

Herein, a hydrophobic beta-NaYF4 :Yb,Er up-conversion ultrathin layer with particle size ca. 6 nm was first applied to modify the MAPbI(3) film for optimizing the surface of perovskite film. Thereby, the corresponding PSCs yield a significantly enhanced power conversion efficiency of 15.17% compared with that (13.32%) of the pristine PSCs. Furthermore, the PSCs also have a good stability in air atmosphere (relative humidity <= 45%) because of the introduction of this hydrophobic material. After a series of detailed investigations and comparison, it can be easily concluded that the filled pinholes and gaps in perovskite films via beta-NaYF4:Yb,Er nanoparticles is the main reason for the performance enhancement of the beta-NaYF4:Yb,Er based PSCs, which can result in an enhanced hole extraction efficiency and reduced interface charge recombination. As a conclusion, it is a feasible and effective approach for improving the photovoltaic performance of PSCs by filling up the pinholes and gaps in perovskite films with up-conversion ultrathin layers.

However, most of the reported CsPbX3 films are fabricated by the uncontrolled solution method, and it is challenging to generate pinhole-free Br-rich films due to the over-rapid liquid-phase reaction feature and the solubility limitation of bromide. Herein, we develop a sequential chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method to fabricate colorful, bandgap tunable, and stable CsPb(IxBr1-x)(3) films.

Strikingly, it is found that CsPb(IxBr1-x)(3) films become very stable in air ambient when x is less or equal to 0.5.

Such high energy species dissociate the precursor and superheat the solvent, quickly and efficiently curing the perovskite film.

Although strategies have been reported to solve this issue, these methods are introduced during core-device fabrication processes which will increase the risk of introducing unexpected impurities during the fabrication. Herein, we introduce the first kind of simple post-device ligand (PDL) treatment to significantly improve the PCE of completely fabricated PVSCs from 18.7% to 20.13%. Meanwhile, the stability of the treated devices without any encapsulation remarkably improves, with 70% PCE maintained under ambient conditions after a 500-hour maximum-power-point tracking test, while the control unencapsulated device will completely break down within 100 hours. Equally important is that this post-device treatment shows a special stitching effect', namely repairing the as-fabricated poor devices' by healing the defects of the perovskite active region, and can improve the PCE by over 900%. We also experimentally and theoretically study the fundamental mechanism of the improvement. Consequently, our approach greatly improves the production yield of high-quality PVSCs and their module performances as well as the reduction of lead-waste. Additionally, the treatment is an off-the-shelf post-device approach that can be integrated into any existing perovskite-device fabrication, offering a general strategy to improve the stability and performance of perovskite optoelectronic devices.",,,,"Mao, Jian/M-6771-2019; Zhang, Hong/I-7994-2016; Milic, Jovana V./K-2251-2019","Mao, Jian/0000-0001-8780-4252; Zhang, Hong/0000-0002-5321-0680; Milic, Jovana V./0000-0002-9965-3460",,,,,,,,,,,,1754-5692,1754-5706,,,,1-Aug,2018,11,8,,,,,2253,2262,,10.1039/c8ee00580j,,,,,,,,WOS:000442262900033,,,,,

However, such dopants not only induce deleterious effects on stability but also significantly affect the hysteresis of PSCs. Here, we demonstrate that a fluorine-containing hydrophobic Lewis acid dopant (LAD) can be employed as an effective dopant for PTAA to realize an exceptional fill factor of 0.81 and a record PCE as high as 19.01%, the highest value among the ever reported PSCs based on a novel dopant in the HTL, versus 17.77% for the control device with Li-TFSI/t-BP doped PTAA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case in which a PSC based on a novel dopant for the HTL shows higher efficiency than a PSC based on the state-of-the-art bi-dopants Li-TFSI/t-BP. Besides, the LAD-based PSC displays lower J-V hysteresis and much better long-term stability of up to 70 days under air exposure without encapsulation.

Herein, we demonstrate a carbon-based planar heterojunction PSC using high-crystallinity Ni-doped rutile TiO2 as electron transport layer (ETL) for the first time, while copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) is introduced as hole transport layer (HTL). It is found that Ni doping can shift the Fermi level of the ETL upward and increase the charge mobility of the TiO2 film, thus enhancing the charge transport and extraction. An optimized PCE of 17.46% was obtained after 0.01 M Ni doping, comparable to or even better than devices with state-of-the-art doped Spiro-OMeTAD as HTL and Au as CE.

Detailed superior capability of Ni-doped TiO2 in facilitating charge transfer and suppressing carrier recombination are revealed by Hall effect and photoluminescence (PL) as well as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. Furthermore, the use of highly stable CuPc and commercial carbon makes asprepared PSCs exhibit excellent stability with no obvious decline in PCE after being stored in ambient air for 1200 h.

Adding excess amounts of Pb to the precursor resulted in a presence of Pb in the perovskite (PVS) active layer.

Xray Diffraction and Time-resolved Photoluminescence analyses were used to evaluate the impact of excess Pb before and after illumination. The results indicate that changes in the crystallinity occur without any significant decrease in charge carrier lifetimes, and this is attributed to the formation of the degradation product, PbI2.

Photo-catalysis effect is a highly concerned issue for such TiO2 based devices because of its impact on device stability. To deal with the problem, a strategy was proposed to passivate the surface of TiO2 by a thin layer of in-situ formed SnO2, and then perovskite solar cells (PSCs) were prepared using such modified TiO2. It was observed that, after the surface passivation, photo-to-electric power conversion efficiency, hysteresis as well as stability of the TiO2 based PSCs were all improved. For example, efficiency increased from 14.92 (+/- 1.86)% (AM 1.5G, 100 mW/cm(2)) to 16.33 (+/- 0.26)%; hysteresis index decreased from 20.49 (+/- 11.85)% to 1.40 (+/- 0.01)%. As for stability, after being stored for 25 days (relative humidity of about 45%, no encapsulation), efficiency could preserve 73.99% of the original value, comparing to 47.55% for device based on bare TiO2. Moreover, the passivation was found to accelerate electron extraction, while retard charge recombination between perovskite and TiO2. The improvement was ascribed to the enhanced contact between perovskite and bottom electron-transport-material, passivated surface defects of TiO2 by SnO2, as well as the high mobility of SnO2. Finally, designated ultraviolet (UV) illumination experiment showed that SnO2 passivation could obviously retard the photocatalysis activity of TiO2, thus improve the UV stability of the devices.",,,,"Gao, Yongli/N-8392-2015","Gao, Yongli/0000-0001-9765-5246",,,,,,,,,,,,1566-1199,1878-5530,,,,AUG,2018,59,,,,,,184,189,,10.1016/j.orgel.2018.05.008,,,,,,,,WOS:000452862400028,,,,,

We model and optimize the impact of the thickness of the TCE and the dimensions of the grid elements to balance series resistance, parasitic absorption in the TCE layer, and shading losses to maximize efficiency. The results of the optimization suggest that the efficiency of the standard design can be significantly improved simply by selecting the optimum TCE thicknesses for the cell size. However, the poor scaling of the standard design prevents the fabrication of efficient large area cells. Adding a metal grid allows the efficiency of large area cells (156 mm x 156 mm) to approach that of small cells and exceed 20%. The maximum efficiency is limited by the minimum width of the metal grid elements and the sheet resistance of the metal grid material. In this context, the performances of fluorine-doped tin oxide and indium tin oxide as TCE materials were compared, with indium tin oxide found to be superior.

The PCBM layer is shown to function as an oxygen diffusion barrier and passivation layer against superoxide mediated degradation. The passivation properties of the PCBM layer are shown to depend on the electron affinity of the fullerene acceptor, attributed to the low LUMO level of PCBM energetically inhibiting superoxide generation. We also find that planar structure devices show slower lateral oxygen diffusion rates than mesoporous scaffold devices, with these slower diffusion rates (days per 100 mu m) also being a key factor in enhancing stability. Faster degradation is observed under voltage cycling, attributed to oxygen diffusion kinetics being ion motion dependent.

In this work, we investigate the operational environmental stability of methylammonium lead iodide perovskite solar cells that contain either an inorganic or organic HBL, with only the former effectively blocking ions from migrating to the metal electrode. This is confirmed by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy measured on the electrodes of degraded devices, where only electrodes of devices with an organic HBL show a significant iodine signal. Despite this, we show that when these devices are degraded under realistic operational conditions (i.e., constant illumination in a variety of atmospheric conditions), both types of devices exhibit nearly identical degradation behavior.

The inclination of the substrate led to phase transformation of the deposited films from rutile to either rutile/anatase or anatase, depending on the working pressure. Extreme shadowing at 87 degrees results in a remarkable increase of the films' porosity and surface roughness. The mechanism of the glancing-angle-induced crystalline phase formation is thoroughly discussed based on the thermodynamic, kinetic, and geometrical aspects of the nucleation and is related with the microstructural changes. Both crystalline phase and microstructure significantly affect the wetting properties of the TiO2 films.

The thermodynamic stability of a number of double-perovskite halides has been predicted based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations of compound formation energies. In this paper, we found that the stability prediction can be dependent on the approximations used for the exchange-correlation functionals, e.g., the DFT calculations using the widely used Perdew, Burke, Ernzerhof (PBE) functional predict that Cs2AgBiBr6 is thermodynamically unstable against phase-separation into the competing phases such as AgBr, Cs2AgBr3, Cs3Bi2Br9, etc., obviously inconsistent with the good stability observed experimentally. The incorrect prediction by the PBE calculation results from its failure to predict the correct ground-state structures of AgBr, AgCl, and CsCl. By contrast, the DFT calculations based on local density approximation, optB86b-vdW, and optB88-vdW functionals predict the ground-state structures of these binary halides correctly. Furthermore, the optB88-vdW functional is found to give the most accurate description of the lattice constants of the doubleperovskite halides and their competing phases. Given these two aspects, we suggest that the optB88-vdW functional should be used for predicting thermodynamic stability in the future high-throughput computational material design or the construction of the Materials Genome database for new double-perovskite halides. Using different exchange-correlation functionals has little influence on the dispersion of the conduction and the valence bands near the electronic bandgap; however, the calculated bandgap can be affected indirectly by the optimized lattice constant, which varies for different functionals.

Many experiments show that a slight excess of PbI2 significantly enhances the properties of the most studied CH3NH3PbI3 compound. We use real-time time-dependent density functional theory and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics to demonstrate that the effect arises due to decreased electron-phonon interactions responsible for nonradiative charge recombination. The fast organic CH3NH3+ (MA) cations, present on surfaces of stochiometric and MAI-rich perovskites, are particularly mobile and introduce high-frequency phonons and strong electric fields that couple to the charge carriers and create large nonadiabatic coupling. Excess PbI2 decreases MA surface coverage, reduces the nonadiabatic coupling by up to an order of magnitude, and extends the charge carrier lifetime. Generally, charges in perovskites are long-lived because the nonadiabatic coupling is very small, less than 1 meV, and quantum coherence formed during charge recombination is short, less than 10 fs.

The study results showed that reserves are sufficient to support the total level of solar power, wind power and electric motors. Insufficient reserves may very well constrain certain sub-technologies, but substitutes that take the role of 'back-stop' technologies can be used instead. The exception is batteries, since lithium battery chemistries and reserves were incompatible with the scenarios analysed. Batteries of moderate size, lithium-free chemistry or reserve expansion would make the transition feasible.

Thus, a very promising efficiency of 18.29% with negligible hysteresis and good device stability can be delivered by PASQ-IDT-based inverted PVSCs in the absence of dopants, outperforming the PEDOT: PSS-based control devices (16.14%) and most dopant-free HTMs reported so far.",,,,"Zhu, LN/J-5713-2019","Zhu, LN/0000-0003-0666-2462; Li, Zhongan/0000-0001-9294-8939",,,,,,,,,,,,2050-7488,2050-7496,,,,28-Jul,2018,6,28,,,,,13644,13651,,10.1039/c8ta05026k,,,,,,,,WOS:000439283200014,,,,,

The LiCoO2 film prepared by RF magnetron sputtering is composed of nano-sized particles and a superhydrophilic surface after treating it with UV-ozone, and therefore can be wetted evenly with a (MAI + PbI2)/(DMF + DMSO) precursor solution. By applying chlorobenzene as an anti-solvent, a very dense film with big perovskite grains was formed. After depositing the C-60 electron transporting layer, BCP hole blocking layer and Ag electrode, the best perovskite solar cell achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19% with negligible current hysteresis. The high-efficiency cell is stable up to 90 degrees C in the inert atmosphere without encapsulation, and the PCE only decreases by 2% when the cell was heated at 100 degrees C for 30 minutes. When the cell was heated at 100 degrees C for 5 days, the PCE decreases by only 40%; nevertheless, under the same heating conditions, the efficiency of the PSC based on the PEDOT:PSS HTL is lost totally. The superhydrophilic surface of LiCoO2 made the even wetting of the large surface area with the perovskite precursor solution possible. Therefore the perovskite solar sub-module with an active area of 25.2 cm(2) (on a 10 cm x 10 cm substrate) can be fabricated to achieve a power conversion efficiency of 16% which was further verified to be 15%. The high-efficiency sub-module based on the LiCoO2 HTL also shows good thermal stability, and ca. 10% of the efficiency was lost by heating at 100 degrees C for 30 minutes.

The formation of the graded ETLs can be due to the phase separation between hydrophobic PCBM and hydrophilic C-60-DPM-OE, which was confirmed by XPS depth-profile analysis and an electron energy-loss spectroscope. Comprehensive studies were carried out to explore the characteristics of the graded ETLs in MAPbI(3) solar cells, including the surface properties, electronic energy levels, molecular packing properties and energy transfer dynamics. The elimination of the s-shape in the current density-voltage curves results in an increase in the FF, which originates from the smooth contact between the C-60-DPM-OE and hydrophilic MAPbI(3) and the formation of the more ordered ETL. There was an improvement in device stability mainly due to the decrease in the photothermal induced morphology change of the graded ETLs fabricated from two fullerene derivatives with distinct hydrophilicity.

The work function and electrical conductivity of the carbon electrodes mainly affect the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and series resistance (R,) of the device. In this paper, we propose a hybrid carbon electrode based on a high-temperature mesoporous carbon (m-C) layer and a low-temperature highly conductive carbon (c-C) layer. The m-C layer has a high work function and large surface area and is mainly responsible for charge extraction. The c-C layer has a high conductivity and is responsible for charge transport. The work function of the m-C layer was tuned by adding different amounts of NiO, and at the same time, the conductivities of the hybrid carbon electrodes were maintained by the c-C layer. It was supposed that the increase of the work function of the carbon electrode can enhance the Voc of printable mesoscopic PSCs. Here, we found the Voc of the device based on hybrid carbon electrodes can be enhanced remarkably when the insulating layer has a relatively small thickness (500-1000 nm). An optimal improvement in Voc of up to 90 mV could be achieved when the work function of the m-C was increased from 4.94 to 5.04 eV.

Herein, the increase in grain size on hydrophilic surfaces in the presence of hydroxyl groups and the direct correlation between the perovskite grain formation and photovoltaic performance are investigated. The surface energy of the hole transport layer in planar p-i-n type perovskite solar cells is modulated by the introduction of polymer surfactant additive, poly(ethylene glycol) tridecyl ether (PTE). Perovskite films deposited on a hydrophilic surface by a two-step method contain small grain size, leading to a reduction in photovoltaic performance. In contrast, surface hydroxyl groups were found to induce the preferential (110) orientation and large grain size in the perovskite films deposited by means of a one-step method. Nucleation and growth mechanisms are proposed to explain those different behaviors of the dependence of grain size on surface energy. The enlarged perovskite grains on hydrophilic surfaces lead to an efficiency improvement owing to an increase in the short-circuit current and fill factor.

However, their unstableness under moist condition has retarded the commercial development. Recently, 2D perovskites have received a lot of attention due to their high moisture resistance. In this work, four quasi 2D quasi perovskites are prepared, then their stability under moist condition is investigated. The surface morphology, crystal structure, optical properties, and photovoltaic performance are measured. Among the four quasi-2D perovskites, (C6H5CH2NH3)(2)(FA)(8)Pb9I28 has the best performance: uniform and dense film, extremely well-oriented crystal structure, strong absorption, and a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.40%.

The (C6H5CH2NH3)(2)(FA)(8)Pb9I28 quasi-2D perovskite devices exhibit high humidity stability, maintaining 80% of the starting PCE after 500 h under 80% relative humidity.

In this work, we perform a systematic study to unravel the fundamental mechanisms for the generation of pinholes in solution-processed spiro-MeOTAD films. The formation of pinholes is closely related to the presence of small amounts of secondary solvents (e.g. H2O, 2-methyl-2-butene or amylene employed as a stabilizer, absorbed moisture from ambient, etc), which have low miscibility in the primary solvent generally used to dissolve spiro-MeOTAD (e.g. chlorobenzene). The above findings are not only applicable for spiro-MeOTAD (a small organic molecule), but also applicable to polystyrene (a polymer). The influence of secondary solvents in the primary solvents is the main cause for the generation of pinholes on film morphology.

In this work three hole transport layers are studied with well-defined highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels and interestingly the hysteretic behavior is markedly different. Here it is shown that an adequate energy level alignment between the HOMO level of the extraction layer and the valence band of the perovskite, not only suppresses the hysteresis, avoiding charge accumulation at the interfaces, but also degradation of the hole transport layer is reduced. Numerical simulation suggests that formation of an injection barrier at the organic/perovskite heterointerface could be one mechanism causing hysteresis.

Compared to the widely studied hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites, the all-inorganic derivatives are less well understood even as they promise high inherent stability. Currently, such materials are limited due to the fact that there is a very narrow choice of inorganic cations that can stabilize the desirable perovskite structure. Herein we report on the synthesis and characterization of novel all-inorganic tin-based perovskites and perovskitoids that can be stabilized by the heteroleptic coordination of chloride and iodide anions, Cs2SnCl2I2 (1) and Cs2.38Rb1.62Sn3Cl8I2 (2), consist of two-dimensional (2D) layers of [SnCl4I2](4-) octahedra with different connectivity modes.

The 2D perovskites show wide band gaps and relatively large resistivities, associated with their chemical stability against the oxidation of Sn2+. The chemical stability is coupled with remarkable electronic properties that derive from the perovskite structure. DFT calculations suggest that both compounds are direct band gap semiconductors with large bandwidths, consistently with the experimentally determined band gaps of E-g = 2.62 and 2.81 eV for 1 and 2, respectively.

Using CsPbX3 (X = Br, I) NCs, over 20 molecules were rapidly screened for their surface trap passivation efficacy. Our approach identified trinbutylphosphine (TBPh) as a superb charge trap passivating molecule on MHP surfaces. TBPh treatment brings the photoluminescence quantum yield of CsPbBr3 NCs to near unity and also results in superior surface trap passivation of MHP thin films, even when compared to a previously reported treatment with pyridine.

Some low-cost alternatives have been developed by combining conjugated electron-rich cores with arylamine end-caps, usually in a donor- spacer-donor (D--D) molecular configuration. However, incorporation of electron-rich cores can lead to undesirable up-shift in the HOMO energy level and low stability, and few of these new HTMs can outperform spiro-OMeTAD in terms of device efficiency. Given that electron-deficient units have shown many advantages in developing efficient and stable photovoltaic dyes and polymers, we herein present a couple of novel molecular quinoxaline-based HTMs (TQ1 and TQ2) with a donor-acceptor-donor (D-A-D) configuration, especially for rationally modulating the HOMO level, improving the stability and decreasing the cost.

Organic hole transporting materials (HTMs) can be essentially divided into two subclasses depending on their molecular weight: molecular and polymeric. In the present paper, we fully characterize and compare the electrical response of PSCs prepared with the benchmark molecular Spiro-OMeTAD HTM and the conducting polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) selected as a low-cost and efficient polymer HTM. For both compounds, cells have been prepared without and with doping. Doping the molecular HTM with bis(trifluoromethane)sulfoimide (LiTFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) gives rise to a dramatic power conversion efficiency increase from 5.1% to 17.7%. Impedance spectroscopy investigation of the cells shows that the performance of undoped Spiro-OMeTAD cells is limited by the HTM layer resistance and by the strong charge recombination occurring at the HTM/perovskite interface. In the case of P3HT-based devices, the cell performance is increased by doping to a much less extent. Using LiTFSI and tBP additives leads to the best performance. In impedance spectra, they eliminate the intermediate frequency inductive loop. The additives limit the charge recombination at the interface, reduce the interfacial defects and favor the hole transfer from the perovskite to the HTM layer. Importantly, we show that the P3HT conductivity is not the main limiting parameter of the cell efficiency because of the intrinsic conducting properties of the thiophene chain and that increasing the interchain order does not produce a significant enhancement of the PSC efficiency.",,,,,"GOUBARD, Fabrice/0000-0003-2413-7725",,,,,,,,,,,,2050-7488,2050-7496,,,,21-Jul,2018,6,27,,,,,13350,13358,,10.1039/c8ta03875a,,,,,,,,WOS:000438548800046,,,,,

Here, we present a new class of FPVs by demonstrating switchable ferroelectric photovoltaic effects and narrow band-gap properties using hexagonal ferrite (h-RFeO3) thin films, where R denotes rare-earth ions. FPVs with narrow band gaps suggest their potential applicability as photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices. The h-RFeO3 films further exhibit reasonably large ferroelectric polarizations (4.7-8.5 C cm(-2)), which possibly reduces a rapid recombination rate of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of h-RFeO3 thin-film devices is sensitive to the magnitude of polarization. In the case of the h-TmFeO3 (h-TFO) thin film, the measured PCE is twice as large as that of the BiFeO3 thin film, a prototypic FPV.

In this study, we propose a one-step fabrication of high-quality MAPbI(3) perovskite films in around 50% relative humidity (RH) humid ambient air by using diethyl ether as an antisolvent and methanol as an additive into this antisolvent. Because of the presence of methanol, the water molecules can be efficiently removed from the gaps of the perovskite precursors and the perovskite film formation can be slightly controlled, leading to pinhole-free and low roughness films. Concurrently, methanol can be used to tune the DMSO ratio in the intermediate perovskite phase to regulate perovskite formation. Planar solar cells fabricated by using this method exhibited the best efficiency of 16.4% with a reduced current density-voltage hysteresis. This efficiency value is approximately 160% higher than the devices fabrication by using only diethyl ether treatment. From the impedance measurement, it is also found that the recombination reaction is suppressed when the device is prepared with methanol additive in the antisolvent.

We present here all-inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by modifying TiO2/CsPbBr3 and CsPbBr3/carbon interfaces with carbon quantum dots (CQDs) and phosphorus quantum dots (PQDs), respectively. The electron and hole extractions are markedly enhanced by setting intermediate energy levels, and the optimized PSC achieves a power conversion efficiency of 7.93% in comparison with 6.05% for the device free of CQDs and PQDs. Moreover, the unsealed PSCs are highlighted by long-term stability in high humidity over 1400 h.

Different kinds of cations and anions were used as additives in a N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution containing CsI and PbI2 (1:1 molar ratio). These include HI, HBr, HCI, NH4I, NH4Br, and NH4CI. Additive cations (H+ and NH4+) as well as halide ions (I-, Br-, and Cl-) are important for the properties of PSCs. Especially, the addition of iodine ion showed good characteristics compared to Br- and Cl-. Among the CsPbI3 layers prepared with different kinds of additives and annealed at different temperatures, the X-ray diffraction peaks of CsPbI3 were clearly found at 14 degrees and 28 degrees for the sample annealed at 150 degrees C with 50 mu L of HI, suggesting the formation of a cubic structure at the low temperature of 150 degrees C. The field emission scanning electron microscopy images indicate that the surface of the perovskite layer with hydrogen halide additive (""H+""-based additive) is more uniform than that with ammonium additive. The roughness profiles determined by atomic force microscopy indicate that the CsPbI3 film with HI additive shows the least roughness among the samples with H+-based additives. Therefore, the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.72% is obtained for CsPbI3 PSCs annealed at 150 degrees C with HI (50 mu L). The H+-based additives seem to react with PbI2 in DMF solution, increasing the solubility of PbI2 and thus lowering the processing temperature. Furthermore, the PCE of CH3NH3PbI3-xClx PSCs decreased from 7.45 to 0.23%, whereas that of CsPbI3 PSCs with 50 mu L of HI only decreased from 3.55 to 2.78% after exposing the samples to air for 3 h.

Nonetheless, perovskites' fame extends further since extensive research on these novel semiconductors has also revealed their brightest side. Soon after their irruption in the photovoltaic scenario, demonstration of efficient color tunable-with high color purity-perovskite emitters has opened new avenues for light generation applications that are timely to discuss herein.",,,,"Lozano, Gabriel/K-8842-2013","Lozano, Gabriel/0000-0002-0235-4924",,,,,,,,,,,,1948-7185,,,,,19-Jul,2018,9,14,,,,,3987,3997,,10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b01417,,,,,,,,WOS:000448083300029,29952563,,,,

The perovskite films have been fabricated via lots of deposition methods, but these laboratory-based fabrication methods are not well-matched with large-area manufacture. Herein, spray coating as a deposition technique was explored to prepare perovskite films and break the bottleneck that plagued large-scale production. However, it is hard to reduce the notorious ""coffee-ring effect"" during the process of spraying perovskite films especially in a one-step spraying method. Thus, the vapor-assisted spraying method (VASM), namely, fabricating perovskite films through a vapor-solid in situ reaction between CH3NH3I vapor and sprayed PbI2 films, was creatively applied to the preparation of dense and uniform perovskite films. The surfaces of the sprayed PbI2 films were optimized by adjusting the wettability, viscosity, and contact quality via various methods such as the selection of solvent, solution concentration, and substrate temperature to inhibit the capillary flow and release the pinning contact line. The application of a component solvent could effectively crush the dense structure of the PbI2 film, optimizing the morphology of PbI2 films and reducing the influence of the coffee-ring effect. Integrating the above aspects, the optimized PbI2 films could form uniform perovskite films via an in situ reaction, and a best power conversion efficiency of 17.56% was achieved for planar structure PSCs, which is high among the PSCs fabricated by the spraying method. In addition, the VASM could be applied in the actual conditions for mass production, exhibiting excellent optical and electrical properties and paving the way of the commercialization of PSCs.",,,,"Ding, Xihong/M-4550-2019","Ding, Xihong/0000-0002-5630-202X",,,,,,,,,,,,1944-8244,1944-8252,,,,18-Jul,2018,10,28,,,,,23466,23475,,10.1021/acsami.8b07422,,,,,,,,WOS:000439528400006,29969014,,,,

Moisture sensitivity of perovskite materials is one of the major obstacles which limits the long-term durability of the perovskite solar cells, especially in outdoor operation where rainfall and water accumulation on the solar panels often occur. Micro/nanopinholes within the functional layers of the devices usually lead to water vapor penetration, thus subsequent decomposition of perovskites, and finally poor device performance and shortened operational lifetime. In this work, low-temperature atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique was utilized to incorporate pinhole-free metal oxide layers (TiO2 and Al2O3) into an inverted perovskite solar cell consisting of indium tin oxide/NiO/perovskite/PC61BM/TiO2/Ag. The interface properties between the inserted TiO2 layer and the perovskite layer were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results showed that TiO2 ALD fabrication process had made negligible degradation to the perovskite layer. The TiO2 layer can significantly reduce interfacial charge recombination loss, improve interfacial contact, and enhance water resistance. A maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.3% was achieved for devices with TiO2 interface layers. A stacked Al2O3 encapsulation layer was designed and deposited on top of the devices to further improve device stability under harsh environmental conditions. The encapsulated devices with the best performance retained 97% of the initial PCE after being stored in ambient condition for a thousand hours. They also showed great water resistance, and no significant degradation in terms of PCE and photocurrent of the devices was observed after they were immersed in deionized water for as long as 2 h.

In this work, we report perovskite solar cell integrated CdS-based photoanode for unbiased photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution. An integrated tandem device consisting of mesoporous CdS/TiO2 photoanode paired with a triple-cation perovskite (Cs-0.05(MA(0.1)7FA(0.83))(0.95)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)(3)) solar cell is developed via a facile fabrication route. The proposed photovoltaic integrated photoanode presents an efficient tandem configuration with high optical transparency to long-wavelength photons and strong photoelectrochemical conversions from short-wavelength photons. On the basis of this integrated tandem device, an unbiased photocurrent density of 7.8 mA/cm(2) is demonstrated under AM1.5G illumination.",,,,"Yew, Rowena/A-3130-2017; Wong-Leung, Jennifer/B-9007-2011; Jagadish, Chennupati/L-1957-2015","Yew, Rowena/0000-0001-6560-1753; Wong-Leung, Jennifer/0000-0002-5050-4202; Jagadish, Chennupati/0000-0003-1528-9479; Karuturi, Siva Krishna/0000-0003-2119-0256",,,,,,,,,,,,1944-8244,1944-8252,,,,18-Jul,2018,10,28,,,,,23766,23773,,10.1021/acsami.8b04855,,,,,,,,WOS:000439528400038,29939003,,,,

In this work, FA cation-based perovskite nanocrystals FA(0.8)Cs(0.2)Pb(x)Br(3) (x = 1.0, 0.8, 0.7, and 0.6) are fabricated with stoichiometric modification. The adoption of less-lead precursor is confirmed to be a feasible and effective approach in inhibiting nonradiative recombination by diminishing the presence of uncoordinated metallic Pb atoms. Note that the subsequent devices require the optimized lead ratio for an optimum behavior, a clear influence of Pb ratio on a perovskite LED has been established. No surprisingly, the less-lead perovskites exert positive roles on the perovskite LED performance, not only in terms of efficiency but also in stability. With an optimized composition FA(0.8)Cs(0.2)Pb(0.7)Br(3), the perovskite LED displays the prominent performance with a current efficiency of 28.61 cd A(-1), about-11-fold improvement than the previous best record of pure FA-based perovskite. Additionally, the perovskite device degradation can be mitigated under operating conditions by properly altering precursor stoichiometry, which can be attributed to the hydrogen reaction under moisture-induced ambient. The stoichiometric optimization of the metal Pb in the perovskite is an important strategy on the road to the further development of perovskite LEDs.",,,,"Wang, Kai/F-9944-2013; Chen, Shuming/G-3362-2011","Wang, Kai/0000-0003-0443-6955; Chen, Shuming/0000-0001-5218-3257; Zhang, Yixi/0000-0002-3715-8560",,,,,,,,,,,,1944-8244,,,,,18-Jul,2018,10,28,,,,,24242,24248,,10.1021/acsami.8b03590,,,,,,,,WOS:000439528400091,29956540,,,,
