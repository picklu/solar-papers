In order to achieve higher power conversion efficiencies, it is necessary to approach the radiative limit via suppression of non-radiative recombination losses. Herein, we performed a systematic voltage loss analysis for a typical low-temperature processed, flexible PSC in n-i-p configuration using vacuum deposited C-60 as electron transport layer (ETL) and two-step hybrid vacuum-solution deposition for CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite absorber. We identified the ETL/absorber interface as a bottleneck in relation to non-radiative recombination losses, the quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) decreases from similar to 1.23 eV for the bare absorber, just similar to 90 meV below the radiative limit, to similar to 1.10 eV when C-60 is used as ETL. To effectively mitigate these voltage losses, we investigated different interfacial modifications via vacuum deposited interlayers (BCP, B4PyMPM, 3TPYMB, and LiF). An improvement in QFLS of similar to 30-40 meV is observed after interlayer deposition and confirmed by comparable improvements in the open-circuit voltage after implementation of these interfacial modifications in flexible PSCs. Further investigations on absorber/hole transport layer (HTL) interface point out the detrimental role of dopants in Spiro-OMeTAD film (widely employed HTL in the community) as recombination centers upon oxidation and light exposure.

In this article, we report a generic surface modification strategy that enables the deposition of uniform and dense perovskite films on top of non-wetting interfaces. In contrast to the previous proposed chemical modifications which might alter the optoelectronic properties of the interfacial layers, we realized a nondestructive surface modification enabled by introducing a layer of insulating mesoporous aluminum oxide (Al2O3). The surface energies of the typical non-wetting hole-transport layers (PTAA, P3HT, and Poly-TPD) were significantly reduced by the Al2O3 modification.

However, these are limited to spin-coating processes in a glove box and are yet to be commercialized. Therefore, there is a need to develop a controllable and scalable deposition technique that can be carried out under ambient conditions. Even though the doctor-blade coating technique has been widely used to prepare PSCs, it is yet to be applied to high-efficiency PSCs under ambient conditions (RH similar to 45%, RT similar to 25 degrees C). In this study, we conducted blade-coating fabrication of modified high-efficiency PSCs under such conditions. We controlled the substrate temperature to ensure phase transition of perovskite and added dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to the perovskite precursor solution to delay crystallization, which can facilitate the formation of uniform perovskite films by doctor-blade coating.

High-temperature oxidative/reductive treatments of samples, together with spectral and kinetics measurements were performed in situ with the accessory. Results led to assigning color centers in yellow TiO2 to Ti3+ centers as deep electron traps, and to the establishment of several types of Ti3+-based color centers that include extra-negatively charged Ti delta+ centers (3 > delta > 2). Photochromic occurrences are also elucidated in the Bi-doped perovskite CsPbBr3 under illumination in the region of intrinsic absorption and annealing of photoinduced absorption at T = 200-400K. These phenomena are described in terms of the photogeneration of charge carriers followed by their trapping, which yielded Bi-related electron color centers responsible for the photoinduced absorption and for the thermostimulated detrapping of photoholes that ultimately recombine with the trapped electrons.

Here we demonstrate that surface activation of the mesoscopic titanium dioxide (TiO2) scaffold, utilized in the two-step perovskite synthesis process, significantly affects the final device performance. Irradiating the mesostructured substrate with ultraviolet (UV) light prior to lead iodide (PbI2) deposition has a positive effect on the short-circuit current density and on the overall device performance (leading to a> 20% increase in efficiency in our devices). As most of the UV light is absorbed in the topmost TiO2 layer, the interior of the scaffold remains less activated. This results in a sparsely packed PbI2 structure that facilitates an efficient conversion to the perovskite, while the activated topmost surface improves the perovskite capping layer. On the contrary, plasma treatment of the scaffold also activates the interior parts of the scaffold, which leads to a dense PbI2 structure that hampers the conversion and causing a > 25% efficiency drop.

In this report, an external bias precondition method is adopted to unveil the origin of the inverted hysteresis. The results indicate that the extents of inverted hysteresis are very much dependent on the bias direction of the precondition. To further unveil the effect of the precondition on inverted hysteresis, the microscopic J-V hysteresis was also observed by using conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) measurements. The results indicate that ion migration and accumulation slowly built up at the grain boundaries of the perovskite film when repeating the scan using c-AFM. Furthermore, the transient characteristics based on capacity-frequency plots and open-circuit voltage decay further identify the presence of difference for the different bias preconditions on the device, because the different bias precondition could induce different directions of ions migration and accumulation. These observations are surprising; it can be further identified that the inverted hysteresis originates from the ionic migration and accumulation, and the grain boundary is as the channel of ionic migration and accumulation.

Secondly, ILPF6 can improve the loading amount of perovskite crystals on the TiO2 film. Third, ILPF6 can promote the transport rate of the photogenerated carriers in the perovskite crystal layer.

Nitrogen and oxygen are mainly bound at the GQD edges, resulting in high crystallinity and good electrical properties. A simple solvothermal reaction using N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), whose surface energy is similar to that of graphite as a raw material, can simultaneously exfoliate, cut, and finally transform the graphite into the GQDs with heteroatoms derived from the decomposed NMP solution. The synthesized NO-GQDs have a less defective and more selectively edge-functionalized structure compared to other reported GQDs. The electrical properties of NO-GQDs are investigated using them as the additive of hole-transporting materials (HTMs) in an optoelectronic device such as perovskite solar cells (PeSCs). Compared with PEDOT:PSS, a mixture of NO-GQDs and PEDOT:PSS shows a 36.2% increase in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) (maximum PCE: 11.47%) and good device stability.

Up to now, the highest device efficiencies were recently achieved by employing n-type SnO2 on the transparent front electrode with conventional structure (n-i-p structure), while TiO2 remains the most used electron transport layer in PSCs. However, the comparably large J-V hysteresis in planar PSCs and the high temperature process required in mesoporous TiO2 structures severely limit the further commercial application. Therefore, inverted PSCs (p-i-n structure) employing p-type NiOx as the hole transport layer (HTL) on the front electrode have attracted massive attention in recent years. This is mainly due to their lower processing temperature for large scale and flexible devices, negligible J - V hysteresis effects, and furthermore, better stability as compared to organic HTLs. In spite of all these merits of NiOx based HTLs, the reported efficiencies of inverted PSCs are still lower than that of conventional PSCs. The main reasons can be assigned to limitations arising from the low conductivity and a mismatched band position of NiOx. Doping has been considered to be an effective way to adjust the electrical and optical properties of semiconductor oxides in a large extent and has already shown promising results in improving the photovoltaic performance of NiOx based inverted PSCs. In this review, recent investigations about the influence of doping on the structural, electrical, and optical properties of NiOx HTLs are summarized.

The synergistic strategy extends the carrier recombination lifetime and reduces the charge trap density. In addition, the current hysteresis of the inverted device was also effectively eliminated. As a result, the champion cell in small area shows 20.06% efficiency with no hysteresis, along with an efficiency 18.77% for inverted PSCs in an active area of 1 cm(2), both of which are the highest efficiency in the one-step PEDOT:PSS-based inverted PSCs so far.

However, the production of LaVO3 thin films still requires a complex process (MBE, PLD), and the growth window of LaVO3 structure in terms of La/V ratio, already defined in the literature using hybrid-MBE is not determined for elaboration based on magnetron co-sputtering of both vanadium and lanthanum targets followed by an external reducing annealing that we use here. La/V ratio has been varied from 0.52 to 1.68 by changing the power applied to the vanadium target in order to synthesize films with different La/V ratios. The off-stoichiometry growth window has been investigated by complementary methods (XRD, XPS, FTIR and TEM). X-ray diffraction highlights the LaVO3 structure for all the films. For La-rich samples (La/V ratio >1.2), the formation of lanthanum oxide La2O3 is observed at the top surface and interface with the substrate, according to XPS, FTIR and TEM investigations. On the other hand, for V-rich samples, only a slight modification of the structure is observed below the La/V ratio = 0.6; with the presence of a new IR vibration mode corresponding to a small contribution of vanadium oxide(s) present in volume.

To do this, one of the greatest challenges lies in the deposition of efficient and stable inorganic CTLs on top of perovskites. Here, a general strategy, i.e., depositing monodisperse nanocrystals followed by a special thermal treatment, has been proposed to fabricate high-quality carbide-metal oxide (C-MOX) CTLs on top of the inorganic perovskite of CsPbI2Br. Effects of the energy levels, conductivities and chemical stabilities of different CTLs on the efficiency and long-term stability of their corresponding PSCs have been systematically studied. It has been found that the inverted CsPbI2Br PSC based on C-TiO2 yields the highest power conversion efficiency of up to 14.0%, mainly attributed to its best interfacial band alignment and suitable conductivity, and except those based on C-ZnO with lower chemical resistance to halide perovskites, all-layer-inorganic PSCs present excellent stabilities, and could retain >90% of their initial PCEs after aging at 85 degrees C in the dark and under continuous light-soaking at 45 degrees C for 1000 hours.",,,,"wu, shaohang/D-8666-2014","wu, shaohang/0000-0003-2422-4650",,,,,,,,,,,,2050-7488,2050-7496,,,,21-Aug,2019,7,31,,,,,18603,18611,,10.1039/c9ta05802h,,,,,,,,WOS:000479056700040,,,,,

The energy level alignments, carrier transport and recombination dynamics were systematically studied in comparison with the benchmark PC61BM.

The carrier transport and recombination processes were further evaluated through steady state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, space-charge-limited current, and Mott-Schottky measurements. An accelerated carrier injection ability and a passivated interface defect density between the perovskite and Q10 ETL were observed. Charge density difference from DFT calculations also determined that the band alignment of Q10 promoted easier charge transport from the perovskite. Moreover, the long alkyl chain of the Q10 molecule endows it with excellent hydrophobic properties, which largely improves the water-resistance capability of the Q10 ETL.

Transient photoconductivity measurements reveal a surprising bipolar behavior with a fast positive response followed by exponential negative photocurrent decay, resulting in an equilibrium photocurrent even below the dark level. The NPC effect in Bi-doped CH3NH3PbBr3 is among the largest ones reported so far for semiconductors. It is proposed that the transition to negative photoconductance is related to the presence of DX-like centers in Bi-doped halide perovskites, similar to doped III-V and chalcopyrite semiconductors. Such photogenerated DX-like centers in the Bi-doped CH3NH3PbBr3 can trap mobile band electrons and enhance charge recombination, thus reducing the conductivity.

The electrical charge transport, measured under both dark and illuminated conditions, is analyzed in terms of the thermionic emission theory of metal-semiconductor junction. The observed decrease in the Schottky diode resistance (R-s) for all the materials can be correlated to the decrease in the potential barrier upon light illumination.

However, for a deposition method to become industrially scalable, reproducible process control and high device yields are essential. Unfortunately, to date, the control and reproducibility of evaporating organic precursors such as methylammonium iodide (MAI) have proved extremely challenging. We show that the established method of controlling the evaporation rate of MAI with quartz microbalances (QMBs) is critically sensitive to the concentration of the impurities MAH(2)PO(3) and MAH(2)PO(2) that are usually present in MAI after synthesis. Therefore, controlling the deposition rate of MAI with QMBs is unreliable since the concentration of such impurities typically varies from one batch of MAI to another and even during the course of a deposition. However once reliable control of MAI deposition is achieved, we find that the presence of precursor impurities during perovskite deposition does not degrade the solar cell performance.

As a consequence, power conversion efficiency is improved from 12.53 to 16.25 and 17.00% upon surface modifications of NiOx with PTZ-1 and PTZ-2, respectively.

Recently, OSCs based on nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) have achieved high PCEs at decreased E-loss values. Therefore, the present study investigates the relationship between E-loss, and the device performance of NFA-based OSCs. Here, we select two polymer donors (PBDB-T and its fluorinated derivative PBDB-TF) and blend each polymer donor with each of three NFAs (indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b']dithiophene and 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IEIC) and its respective fluorinated and chlorinated derivatives IE-4F and IE-4Cl), which provide varied energy-level alignments. The six blends exhibit similar morphologies and charge transport properties but varied E-loss values in OSCs. The results indicate that the charge generation and PCE of the OSCs increase with the increasing E-loss. Accordingly, the PBDB-T:IE-4Cl-based device yields the highest PCE of 11.1% with an E-loss, of 0.64 eV, while the PBDB-TF:IEIC-based device provides a significantly decreased PCE of 3.8% with a diminished E-loss of 0.52 eV.

How strongly performance of barrier/adhesive systems depends on barrier orientation, adhesion, manipulation, defects, and storage procedures is quantified via calcium tests.

Thus, this work demonstrates that the bottom-up, simultaneous interfacial and bulk trap passivation using NSE modifiers is a promising strategy to overcome outstanding issues impeding further PSC advances.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0935-9648,1521-4095,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1903239,10.1002/adma.201903239,,AUG,2019,,,,,WOS:000480449200001,31402528,,,,

H-2 is produced on the cathode, and soluble redox ions in a reduced form are oxidized on the anode. The ions are then transferred to a separate reactor to oxidize the sulfide ions via a homogeneous reaction, and the reduced redox ions are recirculated.

Confirmed by systematic electrochemical and photoelectrical techniques, the Bi2Te3 interlayer optimizes hole extraction and transport efficiency because of the matched band level structure and drastically reduces trap defect densities. Prolonged effective lifetime and shorter diffusion time induced by the Bi2Te3 interlayer reveal less electron-hole recombination and more efficient carrier transport, which lead to a larger photocurrent and less open circuit voltage loss of PSCs. The all-inorganic PSCs with the optimal Bi2Te3 interlayer exhibit a highly enhanced PCE of 11.96%. Moreover, Bi2Te3 also acts as a blocking layer for the migration of iodide ions, silver, and moisture, resulting in a considerable device stability of more than 70% of initial PCE after 50 days without extra encapsulation.

Here, we show improved moisture and thermal stability through the use of cesium oleate to modify the perovskite/hole transporting material interface. Passivation using cesium oleate does not induce the formation of any low-dimensional perovskites, suggesting that the organic species only passivate the perovskite's surface and grain boundaries. As a result, enhanced hydrophobic character of the perovskite film is realized upon passivation, evidenced by a large water contact angle of 107.4 degrees and improved stability at ambient conditions (a relative humidity of similar to 70%, room temperature). Concomitantly, the proposed passivation strategy leads to an increased amount of cesium concentration within the films, resulting in beneficial enhanced thermal stability of the film at 85 degrees C. By maintaining the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the solar absorber while concurrently passivating the interfacial defects and vacancies, improved open-circuit voltage (V-oc) and unsacrificed short-circuit current density (J(sc)) were obtained from the treated devices, leading to power conversion efficiencies of more than 18%.

Nonetheless, issues such as poor interface contact with an adjacent perovskite layer and obvious hysteresis phenomenon are bottlenecks that need to be overcome to make carbon-based PSCs (C-PSCs) more attractive in practice. Herein, we report an effective method to enhance the interfacial charge transport of C-PSCs by introducing the CuSCN material into the device. Two types of CuSCN-assisted devices were studied in this work. One was based on the deposition of an ultrathin CuSCN layer between the perovskite absorber layer and the carbon cathode (PSK/CuSCN/C), and the other was by infiltrating CuSCN solution into the carbon film (PSK/C-CuSCN) by taking advantage of the macroporous structure of the carbon. We have found that the CuSCN incorporation by both methods can effectively address the hysteretic feature in planar C-PSCs. The origin for the hysteresis evolution was unraveled by the investigation of the energy alignment and the kinetics of interfacial charge transfer and hole trap-state density. The results have shown that both types of CuSCN- containing devices showed improved interfacial charge carrier extraction, suppressed carrier recombination, reduced trap-state density, and enhanced charge transport, leading to negligible hysteresis. Furthermore, the CuSCN-incorporated C-PSCs demonstrated enhanced device stability. The power conversion efficiency remained 98 and 91% of the initial performance (13.6 and 13.4%) for PSK/CuSCN/C and PSK/C-CuSCN, respectively, after being stored under a high humidity (75-85%) environment for 10 days.

The results of microzone photoluminescence indicate that the evaporated CsBr gathered at the grain boundaries of CsPbI2Br layers and Br-enriched perovskites (CsPbIxBr3-x, x < 2) are formed, which can provide protection for CsPbI2Br.

However, low-bandgap perovskite solar cells based on mixed Pb and Sn generally suffer from inferior performance, hindering the further development of tandem perovskite solar cells. One of the main reasons is the relatively high open-circuit voltage loss in low-bandgap perovskite solar cells, which is generally attributed to the high trap density in perovskite films and energy-level mismatch between different functional layers in the device. In this study, we find another mechanism that can cause high open-circuit voltage loss and degrade device performance, which is silver diffusion towards the perovskite layer. Devices based on a typical inverted structure (indium tin oxide/PEDOT:PSS/FA(0.5)MA(0.5)Sn(0.5)Pb(0.5)I(3)/PCBM/Ag) suffered from severe silver diffusion that contaminated the whole perovskite layer during the thermal deposition process of the silver electrode.

Accordingly, we inserted a ZnO layer between the PCBM layer and silver electrode to significantly suppress silver diffusion, which dramatically improved the open-circuit voltage from 0.59 V to 0.79 V. Ultimately, a highly efficient low-bandgap Sn-Pb mixed perovskite solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of 18.1% and low open-circuit voltage loss of 0.40 V was achieved, which represents one of the state-of-the-art results in this field.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2050-7488,2050-7496,,,,7-Aug,2019,7,29,,,,,17324,17333,,10.1039/c9ta04366g,,,,,,,,WOS:000476913600014,,,,,

However, the use of plasmonic NPs in perovskite solar cells has been barely reported, and it is not known whether inserting plasmonic NPs into a perovskite active layer produces any performance advantage compared with a pure perovskite counterpart.

However, the research of efficiency improvement never stops. This work introduces an effective approach to remarkably reduce the device reflection loss by using light management (LM) cover layer. A specific model combined with ray and wave optics was built to numerically optimize the texture of the LM layers for light harvesting in photovoltaics cells and explore the optical principles in the light trapping. The LM layer texture is made of 2D periodic triangle structures. Both symmetric and asymmetric triangle structures were investigated. The results indicate that asymmetric structures possess the close performance compared with symmetric ones, and notably, on contrary to the symmetric structures, the light trapping abilities are much more insensitive to the bottom thicknesses of asymmetric structures. It will benefit the practical fabrication, since the precise bottom thickness control can be avoided. From the optimization results, 3 optimal structures are found. With the optimal LM layers, a thin active layer (165nm) device is able to produce the short circuit current intensities (Jsc) of around 21mA/cm(2), which is approximately equivalent to the Jsc of a thick active layer (800nm) device without LM layers. Meanwhile, about 23% power conversion efficiency (PCE) enhancement is achieved. On the other hand, active layer thickness also makes influence on the light trapping abilities. As the active layer thickness is increased from 165nm to 800nm, the Jsc only improves by about 2.4mA/cm(2), while the PCE enhancement is dropped from similar to 23% to similar to 11%. In consideration of the compromise between total device energy output and PCE enhancement. as well as material cost reduction, the active layer with around 165nm should be an optimal thickness.

The enhanced device performance can be attributed as follows: first, the strong dipole field induced by the 4-fluoro-phenethylammonium (4FPEA) organic spacer facilitates charge dissociation. Second, fluorinated RPP crystals preferentially grow along the vertical direction, and form a phase distribution with the increasing n number from bottom to the top surface, resulting in efficient charge transport. Third, 4FPEA-based RPP films exhibit higher film crystallinity, enlarged grain size, and reduced trap-state density.

To achieve better performance and stability, interface passivation is an effective method. So far, the most commonly used passivators are organic amines, which can tailor perovskite into a lower-dimensional structure (RuddlesdenPopper perovskite). Here, we select a biimizole (BIM) molecule as a new passivator for perovskite. The BIM based single layer perovskite has a more rigid structure. And multi-layered structure cannot be formed due to large lattice mismatching and structural rigidity. By inducing the excess MAI (methanaminium iodide) into the lattice, the layered structure is maintained, and half of the BIM molecules are replaced by MA (methylamine). The mixed layered structure is distorted, because of the difference in size between two kinds of cations. We then investigate passivation effect of BIM on perovskite solar cells. By carefully controlling the feed ratio in precursor solutions, we fabricate solar cells with different passivation structures. We find that the introduction of BIM can cause V-oc to increase generally, indicating that MAPbI(3) is well passivated. The peak at 7.5 degrees and 15 degrees in X-ray diffraction pattern are corresponding to a two-dimensional (2D) phase with a shorter layer distance. There are no peaks at lower degrees, so that no multi-layered structure is formed in the film either. We suppose that a dual-phase 2D-3D (where 3D represents three-dimensional) structure is formed in the perovskite film. To explain the passivation effect of the two 2D structures, we investigate their lattice matching towards MAPbI(3). The distorted 2D structure is well matched with (110) face of o-MAPbI(3), and the mismatching rate is lower 1% in the two directions. On the other hand, the BIM based 2D structure cannot well match with (-110) face of o-MAPbI(3), nor with (001) face of c-MAPbI(3). We also consider that the less rigidity of distorted structure contributes to better passivation. As a result, we achieve a BIM passivated perovskite solar cell with a power conversion efficiency up to 14%.

Recently, the power conversion efficiency of organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells has been enhanced to more than 23% in laboratory. In solution processed perovskite solar cells, perovskite and charge transport layer are stacked together, due to the different crystallization rates leading to lattice mismatch near the surface region of perovskite film, resulting in a lot of interface defects, especially at the interface between perovskite and charge transport layer. What is more, the photo-induced free carriers must transfer across the interfaces to be collected. But the defects near the interface can trap photogeneration electrons, thus reducing the carrier lifetime and causing the charges to be recombined, which greatly influence the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells. Therefore, reducing and passivating these defects is critical for obtaining the high performance perovskite solar cells. Now, there have been made tremendous efforts devoting to advancing passivation techniques, such as doping and surface modification, for high efficiency perovskite solar cell with improved stability and reduced hysteresis. These approaches also contribute to improving the energy band alignment between carrier transport layers and perovskite absorber improving device performance, or resistance moisture to enhance device stability.

In all-inorganic cesium lead halide perovskites, CsPbX3 (X = Br, I) exhibits excellent photoelectric properties, which are similar to those of organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites. The CsPbI3 faces a challenge of unideal tolerant factor for perovskite phase while CsPbI3-xBrx has better tolerant factor. Among them, CsPbI2Br is one of most popular candidates because of its good thermal stability. Nevertheless, CsPbI2Br shows instability due to the phase transition caused by moisture and lower efficiency because of defects. For all inorganic perovskite devices, the alkyl chain length of surface treatment agent should be taken into account when using organic cationic passivation method. In this paper, CsPbI2Br perovskite is treated with different organic ammonium salts to enhance its phase stability. The experimental results show that a-phase CsPbI2Br is more stable with the increase of the alkyl chain length. Butylamine iodine (BAI) among three kinds of surface treating agents is proved to have the best defect passivation and phase stabilization effect. With the increase of alkyl chain length, the hydrophobicity of the organic molecular layer increases, which plays a crucial role in protecting optically active CsPbI2Br. Meanwhile, it is found that the stability of perovskite is enhanced with the concentration of the BAI solution increasing. This should be related to the organic cation termination formed on the surface of CsPbI2Br film. Solar cell devices based on the CsPbI2Br thin films treated with different concentrations of BAI are assembled and then the effect of organic ion surface treatment on the photoelectric performance of batteries is further explored. The experimental results show that when the concentration of BAI is relatively high (4 mg/mL and 8 mg/mL), the device's photovoltaic performance decreases especially the photocurrent obviously decreases, while the post-treatment process using 2 mg/mL BAI will enhance not only the phase stability but also the photovoltaic parameters after defect passivation.

However, the poor stability and toxicity of organic lead halogen perovskites are still a major challenge for deploying the outdoor solar cells. Element substitution is a simple and effective strategy to solve these problems. For example, the substitution of the I ions with Cl and Br has been regarded as a reliable method to improve the device stability. A-site engineering, i.e., replacing organic ions with inorganic cations (such as Cs+, Rb+), has also been reported. The B-site alloying approach has been demonstrated with Zn, Sr, Sn, etc. Inorganic halide perovskites can be synthesized by the low-cost solution spin-coating method and have similar optoelectronic properties and improved stability to their organic counterparts. Here in this paper, we report a comprehensive study of the alloyed perovskite CsPb1-xBaxX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) by combining the disorder alloy structure search method with first-principles energy calculations. We find that it is not easy to dope barium into the perovskite lattice when Ba concentration is low and the stable disordered solid solution can exist in the high Ba concentration case. Carrier effective mass and bandgap increase with the increase of Ba concentration and the bandgap change range is wide, owing to the difference in both electronegativity and ionic radius between Pb and Ba. After inducing Ba into CsPb1-xBaxX3 (X = Cl, Br, I), the higher electron concentration on the I sites also enhances the Coulomb interaction of the Pb I bonds. Moreover, the electrons and holes tend to be located on Pb sites, and this may give rise to the formation of local potential wells, which would further induce the large lattice deformation to accommodate the self-trapped excitons. Especially, CsPbI3-Pnma perovskite is metastable in the ambient environment with a suitable photon absorption threshold. The CsPb1-x BaxI3 can be used as a capping layer on CsPbI3 in solar cells, thereby significantly improving the power conversion efficiency and long-term stability. Overall, the alloyed perovskite CsPb1-xBaxX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) with high Ba concentration can be stable and less-toxic, and they can be used in short wave light-emitting diodes, radiation detectors or other fields because of their large bandgaps (> 2.8 eV).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1000-3290,,,,,5-Aug,2019,68,15,,,,,,,157101,10.7498/aps.68.20190596,,,,,,,,WOS:000478690600014,,,,,

However, the photoelectric conversion process within the device is still not understood clearly. One of the major reasons is that it is difficult to directly observe the space potential inside the device and its effect on the photogenerated charge carriers. The direct measurement and analysis of the space potential inside the device and the clarification of the intrinsic relationship between the space potential and the charge carrier micro-process under illumination and different electric field conditions can reveal the photoelectric conversion mechanism in depth, and thus providing the scientific research basis for the further development. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), a testing technology that is non-contact, can detect the space potential distribution without any damage to the device, demonstrating the great potential to unveil the working mechanism of perovskite solar cells accurately. Such a characterization method can work under vacuum condition. The KPFM combines Kelvin method of measuring contact potential difference with the scan probe microscopy to characterize internal carrier dynamic behavior with high resolution on a nanometer scale. The study of the spatial potential distribution of semiconductor device plays an important role in understanding the working mechanism of new perovskite solar cells. For example, under an open-circuit condition, the intensity and width of the electric field and space charge region can be obtained from the spatial potential distribution, and the bending direction of the energy band can be judged according to the increase or decrease of the potential. While in a short-circuit case, the generation and transport of charge carriers can be obtained. In this review, we mainly introduce the research progress of the space potential distribution and optoelectronic conversion mechanism in perovskite solar cells. The key mechanism of charge carrier generation, separation, transport and recombination are revealed by using KPFM to directly observe the space potential variations caused by light or electric field.

Unfortunately, such dopants negatively impact the overall PSCs stability and add cost and complexity to the device fabrication. Hence, there is a need to investigate new strategies to boost the typically modest performance of dopant-free HTMs for efficient and stable PSCs. Thionation is a simple and single-step approach to enhance the carrier-transport capability of organic semiconductors, yet still completely unexplored in the context of HTMs for PSCs. In this work, a novel polymeric semiconductor, P1, based on a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) moiety, is proposed as a dopant-free HTM. Its modest performance in PSCs (power conversion efficiency (PCE) = 7.1%) is significantly enhanced upon thionation of the DPP moiety. The resulting dithioketopyrrolopyrrole-based HTM, P2, leads to PSCs with nearly 40% performance improvement (PCE = 9.7%) compared to devices based on the nonthionated HTM (P1). Furthermore, thionation also remarkably boosts the shelf-storage and thermal stability with respect to traditional 2,2 ',7,7 '-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9 '-spirobifluorene-based PSCs.

Here, we report a combined study of hot electron flux and the lifetime of hot carriers using a perovskite-modified plasmonic nanodiode. We found that perovskite deposition on a plasmonic nanodiode can considerably improve hot electron generation induced by photon absorption. The perovskite plasmonic nanodiode consists of MAPbI(3) layers covering a plasmonic-Au/TiO2 Schottky junction that is composed of randomly connected Au nanoislands deposited on a TiO2 layer. The measured incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency and the short-circuit photocurrent show a significantly improved solar-to-electrical conversion performance of this nanodiode. Such an improvement is ascribed to the improved hot electron flux in MAPbI(3) caused by effective light absorption from near-field enhancement of plasmonic Au and the efficient capture of hot electrons from Au nanoislands via the formation of a three-dimensional Schottky interface. The relation between the lifetime and flux of hot electrons was confirmed by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy that showed considerably longer hot electron lifetimes in MAPbI(3) combined with the plasmonic Au structure.

The reciprocity theorem is applied to determine the maximum open-circuit voltage (V-oc) the device can deliver under solar illumination. A V-oc of 1.295 V is found, analyzing the measured external quantum efficiency and assuming only radiative recombination. For comparison, the experimental open-circuit voltage found for the studied 2D|3D heterojunctions is 1.15 V. The contribution of nonradiative recombination is explored by measuring the electroluminescence quantum yield. A quantum yield of 0.4% is found at current densities equivalent to 1 sun illumination. This translates into a V-oc loss of approximate to 140 mV, which is in very good agreement with the experimental findings.

However, efficiency enhancements through plasmonic routes are limited to the short wavelength range corresponding to metal extinction wavelength. Thus, the exploration of novel plasmonic nanostructures with predesigned sizes and shapes is needed to advance this field.

This assignment is consistent with electromodulation spectroscopy under cathodic and anodic charge accumulation conditions, where we observed an absorption onset at a higher energy under electron accumulation (850 nm) compared to that of hole accumulation (1050 nm). Global target analysis of our time-resolved spectra suggests that the temporal evolution of photogenerated conduction band electrons and trap state bleaching dynamics are correlated. We modeled the kinetics of the species-associated spectra based on free charge extraction, bimolecular recombination, charge trapping, and Auger recombination processes and found that longer electron lifetimes correlate with decreased trap state density and improved device efficiency resulting from higher fill factors.

These remarkable properties make Yb3+:CsPb(Cl1-xBrx)(3) an extremely promising candidate for spectral shaping in high-efficiency photovoltaic devices. Previous theoretical assessments of such ""downconversion"" devices have predicted single-junction efficiencies up to 40%, but have been highly idealized. Real materials like Yb3+:CsPb(Cl1-xBrx)(3) have practical limitations such as constrained band-gap and PL energies, non-directional emission, and an excitation-power-dependent PLQY. Hence, it is unclear whether Yb3+:CsPb(Cl1-xBrx)(3), or any other non-ideal quantum-cutting material, can indeed boost the efficiencies of real high-performance PV. Here, we examine the thermodynamic, detailed-balance efficiency limit of Yb3+:CsPb(Cl1-xBrx)(3) on different existing PV under real-world conditions. Among these, we identify silicon heterojunction technology as very promising for achieving significant performance gains when paired with Yb3+:CsPb(Cl1-xBrx)(3), and we predict power-conversion efficiencies of up to 32% for this combination.

Predicted annual energy yields are comparable to those of tandem perovskite-on-silicon technologies, but without the need for current matching, tracking, or additional electrodes and inverters.

Such enhancement is attributed to the increased binding energy of self-trapped excitons (STEs) upon radiation pressure, which is consistent with its blue-shifted PL and other characterization results. Furthermore, we study ultrafast absorption spectroscopy and find that the dynamics of relaxation from free excitons to STEs in radiation pressure CsPbBr3 QDs is ascribed to stronger electron-phonon coupling in the contracted octahedral structure.

We show that by a careful choice of the permittivity of the alcoholic solvent in the conversion step the surface morphology can be finely modified, thereby yielding pinhole-free and compact absorber films comparable to that from vapour-assisted solution techniques. It is observed that the permittivity controls the intensity of the Ostwald ripening effect and that a low value of the former enables an in situ intercalation of precursor materials into the lead halide framework.

In this work, we show that lowering the bulk recombination does not necessarily result in enhanced performance metrics of electronic devices. From the perspective of charge carrier extraction and injection, the radiative limit of the open-circuit voltage of solar cells, noise current of photodetectors and lasing threshold of injection lasers cannot be improved if the contacts are not perfectly selective. A numerical drift-diffusion model is used to investigate the interplay between bulk recombination and surface recombination of minority carriers at the contacts in bipolar thin diode devices based on low-mobility semiconductors. The surface recombination becomes prominent in case of reduced bulk recombination strengths when non-selective contacts, i.e., contacts that are either metallic or have imperfect charge-selective interlayers, are employed. Finally, we derive analytical approximations for the case when diffusion-limited surface recombination of minority carriers at Ohmic contacts dominates the dark current. These results indicate that having perfectly selective contacts becomes crucial in systems with suppressed bulk recombination - a challenging requirement for the future state-of-the-art thin-film solar cells, light-emitting devices and photodetectors made of next generation semiconductors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0379-6779,,,,,AUG,2019,254,,,,,,114,121,,10.1016/j.synthmet.2019.06.008,,,,,,,,WOS:000476551000016,,,,,

In this paper, we report the results of a study on various lead iodide perovskite crystals, which were prepared with different organic cations, and their properties in relation to their electronic structures, particularly their valence bands. For this purpose, we have carried out the XRD and UV Photoemission Spectroscopy (UPS) measurements along with the electronic structure computations. Among the organic cations studied here, it is found that not all organic cations can favorably form a perovskite crystal, though it meets the Goldschmidt tolerance factor. The organic cation, which shows the favourability of the formation of perovskite crystal structure, exhibits a band-edge shifting in the UPS spectrum of its perovskite crystal structure toward to smaller binding energy in comparison to the UPS spectrum of its organic salt. Such band edge shifting is corresponding to the formation of the valence band in its perovskite crystal structure. The electronic structure calculations using Density Functional Theory (DFT) method, confirmed the formation of an energy gap that is in good agreement with the experimental results. However, the valence band is mainly constructed by the I- orbitals, while the conduction band is mainly constructed by the Pb2+ orbitals, as reported in some literatures. The present study results then suggests that the organic cations play only a minor role in their photovoltaic processes, though they substantially contribute to the valence band formation by transferring their valence electrons to the iodide elements.",,,,,"Hidayat, Rahmat/0000-0002-3081-4051",,,,,,,,,,,,2053-1591,,,,,AUG,2019,6,8,,,,,,,84009,10.1088/2053-1591/ab1d3f,,,,,,,,WOS:000470228400001,,,,,

To accelerate the degradation process, the PSCs are exposed to concentrated sunlight of 2 suns with different illumination duration under the short-circuited condition. Compared to under the open-circuited condition, the PSCs presented here show a slightly more obvious decrease of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and a more distinct hysteresis with the time of light exposure. We infer that, under the short-circuited condition, the more dramatic migration of ions induced by photocurrents should result in greater ohmic dissipation and more trap states. But the weak degradation effects indicate that the devices still exhibit an unexpected photochemical stability against light exposure. Most importantly, there is a self-healing behavior to partly recover the degradation with the light exposure time of more than 8 h, which can be ascribed to the modification from the Cu electrode and the charge transport layers of PTAA and Bphen.

We used a novel N-2 gas assisted fast crystallization method for the deposition of perovskite film in ambient condition to form uniform Pe layer as compared to the nonuniform film obtained in conventional deposition method. The Pe film on Ag NPs embedded PEDOT:PSS layer shows enhanced optical absorption in the UV-visible region due to the plasmonic absorption by the Ag NPs. At zero bias, the ETL-free Ag NPs-Pe hybrid device shows similar to 45% enhanced responsivity and similar to 3 times faster photoresponse compared to the pristine device. The enhancements in the performance of hybrid photodetector are attributed to plasmon-enhanced optical absorption and hot electron generation, as well as improvement in charge extraction and transport by Ag NPs, which are corroborated by steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements. Impedance analysis of the devices shows the reduced carrier transfer resistance of the hybrid device, which results in superior transport of photo-generated charge carriers. Direct evidence for the increase in the work function by similar to 47 meV for Ag NPs doped PEDOT:PSS film is provided from the Kelvin probe force microscopy analysis.

For the first time in perovskite solar cells, phenothiazine has been introduced, as a low cost substituent to replace commonly used dimethoxydiphenylamine, which constitutes almost 90% of the final cost of hole transporting materials (HTMs). The use of a more flexible central core than state of the art spirobifluorene (SBF) lowers the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level, increases solubility and decreases the glass transition temperature. The derivatives were employed as hole-transport materials for the fabrication of mesoporous ZnO-Mg-EA(NH3+)/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM/Au solar cells. The best cells obtained have an optimized PCE of 12.14% and 4.32% for cells based on 4,4'-dimethoxy-diphenylamine and phenothiazine substituents, respectively. Due to the extremely low cost of TPB(2-TPTZ) which is equal to 3.43 $ g(-1), in solar cells it delivers the lowest cost per peak Watt of 0.014 $ per W-p, which is 15 times lower than spiro-MeOTAD.

During the electrospray process, we observed that Cs2TeI6 microdroplets changed to a steady cone jet and then to an unstable multi-jet model as the electrical bias increased from 6 kV to 12 kV, resulting in variable film morphologies. Five representative solvent systems with different evaporation rates and contact angles on the FTO/double-TiO2 substrates were studied. We find a strong correlation of the contact angle with the speed of primary nucleation, growth mode and subsequent film morphology. Moreover, the crystalline quality has been improved with the rise of substrate temperature. Finally, a dense and uniform Cs2TeI6 film was obtained with an electrical bias of 10 kV using dimethyl formamide (DMF) as the solvent at a substrate temperature of 160 degrees C.

Unfortunately, the employed dopants/additives and the associated oxidation reactions have been shown to deteriorate the long-term device stability seriously. The exploitation of efficient and stable dopant-free HTMs is thus strongly desired for PVSCs. However, effective molecular design strategies for dopant-free HTMs are still lacking. Thus far, only a few of them yielded comparable performance to their doped counterparts, while their synthetic costs are still high. In this work, a new class of cost-effective small molecule dopant-free HTMs have been developed using readily available fluoranthene as the structural framework. The structure-property correlation of the fluoranthene-based HTMs was carefully investigated by tuning their structural geometry (linear vs. branched), connection between electron-donating and electron-withdrawing moieties (single bond vs. ethylene), and the substitution position of the methoxy side-groups (para- vs. meta-). As a result, the optimized molecule, FBA3, was demonstrated to serve as an efficient dopant-free HTM in a conventional PVSC to deliver an impressive power conversion efficiency of 19.27%, representing one of the best cost-effective dopant-free organic HTMs reported thus far.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2041-6520,2041-6539,,,,28-Jul,2019,10,28,,,,,6899,6907,,10.1039/c9sc01697j,,,,,,,,WOS:000476545100014,31402973,,,,

In addition, pulsed heating steps were employed under illumination/dark conditions to simulate a more realistic working temperature condition for photovoltaic devices. The identification of gas decomposition products was based on the quadrupole mass spectrometry technique. The released amounts of sym-triazine, formamidine, and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) were observed to highly depend on the temperature. For the experimental conditions used in this study, sym-triazine was obtained as the thermal product of degradation at temperatures above 95 degrees C. Below this temperature, only formamidine and HCN generation routes were observed. The energy pathways of formamidinium thermal degradation under photovoltaic working temperature conditions were further assessed by density functional theory calculations. The results indicated that formamidinium was more resilient to thermal degradation and the release of irreversible decomposition products compared to methylammonium because of a larger enthalpy and activation energy obtained for the decomposition reactions.

By determining the optical constants of the individual components and using effective-medium approximations, the internal quantum efficiencies (IQE) in both the titania and zirconia layers are determined to be approximate to 85%.

In this process, 1D K-2(Nb0.94Sb0.06)(8)O-21 has been first achieved, and the proportion of the ions in A-sites is affected by the radius and molar ratio of ions. The z axis direction of K-2(Nb0.94Sb0.06)(8)O-21 rod is transformed into the x axis direction of LNKNS2 rod. Furthermore, the output voltage of the 1D niobates-based flexible piezoelectric device (FPD) was nearly 600% compared with that of the isotropic niobates-based FPD. This work also allows convenient fabrication of other 1D multicomponent perovskites.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2589-0042,,,,,26-Jul,2019,17,,,,,,1,+,,10.1016/j.isci.2019.06.012,,,,,,,,WOS:000477767700001,31247446,,,,

Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the relevant recombination pathways is needed. Here, intensity-dependent measurements of the quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) and of the V-OC on the very same devices, including pin-type PSCs with efficiencies above 20%, are performed. It is found that the QFLS in the perovskite lies significantly below its radiative limit for all intensities but also that the V-OC is generally lower than the QFLS, violating one main assumption of the Shockley-Queisser theory. This has far-reaching implications for the applicability of some well-established techniques, which use the V-OC as a measure of the carrier densities in the absorber. By performing drift-diffusion simulations, the intensity dependence of the QFLS, the QFLS-V-OC offset and the ideality factor are consistently explained by trap-assisted recombination and energetic misalignment at the interfaces. Additionally, it is found that the saturation of the V-OC at high intensities is caused by insufficient contact selectivity while heating effects are of minor importance. It is concluded that the analysis of the V-OC does not provide reliable conclusions of the recombination pathways and that the knowledge of the QFLS-V-OC relation is of great importance.",,,,,"Neher, Dieter/0000-0001-6618-8403; Wolff, Christian Michael/0000-0002-7210-1869",,,,,,,,,,,,1614-6832,1614-6840,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1901631,10.1002/aenm.201901631,,JULY,2019,,,,,WOS:000478333300001,,,,,

The methodology proposed is simple and uses low-cost commercial precursors. The conventional method of hybrid perovskite preparation requires methylammonium halide precursors and highly polar solvents. Mandatory use of polar solvents and a particular perovskite precursor makes an intermediate compound which then requires a non-polar solvent to recover the NPs. In contrast here, a whole range of mixed halide perovskite NPs is fabricated without using a methylammonium halide precursor and a polar solvent. In this method, a non-polar solvent is used, which provides a better platform for the particle recovery. Organic cations on the nanoparticle surface prevent degradation from water, due to their hydrophobic nature, and hence offer a stable colloidal suspension in toluene for more than three months. Ab-initio calculations within density functional theory (DFT) predict lower formation energies compared to previously reported values, confirming better chemical stability for this synthesis pathway. Through the halide compositional tuning, these NPs exhibit a variety of emission and absorption starting from ultraviolet to near infrared (IR). The absorption spectra of various halide perovskite show a sharp band edge over the visible wavelength with high absorption coefficient. High oscillator strengths due to high excitonic binding energies combined with the simulated finite dipole transition probabilities point towards the observed high absorption. The emission spectra of mixed halide perovskites vary from 400 to 750 nm, which covers the whole range of visible spectra with sharp full-width at half maxima.

The degradation of perovskite films is usually triggered by the reaction of the perovskite active layer with the superoxide when exposed in ambient atmosphere, which is not prevented by simple encapsulation. Herein, an oxygen-stabilizing effect is found by utilizing a hydrophilic [6,6]-phenyl-C-61-butyric acid-(3,4,5-tris(2-(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)phenyl)methanol ester (PCBB-OEG) as a dopant of the perovskite film and electron-transporting layer (ETL). PCBB-OEG accelerates photoelectron transport in perovskite films and enhances the electron-extracting ability of ETL. This process is demonstrated to efficiently prevent the reaction between electrons and oxygen to form a superoxide. Hence, the presence of PCBB-OEG in the perovskite film improves its stability against oxygen. The stability and efficiency of pero-SCs are further improved by doping PCBB-OEG in [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) ETL. As a result, the p-i-n pero-SCs with PCBB-OEG as an additive in both the perovskite active layer and ETL show the best power conversion efficiency of 20.49%.

Layered halide perovskites (LHPs) suffer from a broad distribution of layer thicknesses and band gaps within thin films. Reducing polydispersity could substantially improve charge transport within LHP films and the performance of LHP-based solar cells. Herein, we focused on layering alpha-CsPbI3 ((C4H9NH3)(2)Csn-1,PbnI3n+1) thin films.

By reducing decomposition rates through combined use of solvent complexes and thermal processing methods, we fabricated (C4H9NH3)(2)CsPb2I7 films that had improved phase purity, crystallinity, and film morphology.

The quality of the ALD films relies much on the surface chemistry reactions involved in the ALD process. Aiming to achieve high-quality ALD films, a careful surface chemistry study is carried out in this work to investigate the surface thermolysis behavior of an amidinate-type nickel precursor, bis(N,N'-di-tert-butylacetamidinato)nickel(II) (Ni(amd)(2)). Using the in situ technique of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, this work reveals a number of implications which are important for the engineering of the ALD processes. The Ni(amd)(2) precursor is shown to be reactive to the SiOx surface even at room temperature, which suggests a good suitability for low-temperature ALD. The surface amidinate moiety is found to decompose at 250 degrees C, which suggests the limitation of Ni(amd)(2) for high-temperature ALD. On the other hand, the byproduct of the surface reaction, amidine, can be adsorbed on the surface at low temperature, which might be trapped in the deposited film, inducing carbon and nitrogen impurities. Therefore, if the goal is to achieve a low impurity, a relatively higher deposition temperature (e.g., at 150-200 degrees C) would be favored. To further demonstrate the important value of the above implications from the thermolysis study, an example of the ALD of NiO is investigated experimentally. Indeed, the NiO films can be successfully deposited at an ever-low temperature of 90 degrees C, and increasing the deposition temperature to 200 degrees C can eliminate the accumulation of carbon and nitrogen impurities at the film-substrate interface, whereas the deposition at 250 degrees C leads to drastic increase in impurities, likely owing to the thermal decomposition of the surface amidinate moiety. All these experimental findings are well consistent with the implications from the surface thermolysis study, which highlights the important value of this surface thermolysis approach for rational ALD process engineering. Given the similarity and broad use of the amidinate-type metal precursors, the results reported herein should also be of significant value for many other ALD processes.",,,,"Wang, Xinwei/I-2850-2012","Wang, Xinwei/0000-0002-1191-8162",,,,,,,,,,,,0897-4756,1520-5002,,,,23-Jul,2019,31,14,,,,,5172,5180,,10.1021/acs.chemmater.9b01267,,,,,,,,WOS:000477093000022,,,,,

Base-catalyzed activation of perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) preceded reaction with phenyl-aminosilane-terminated surfaces, yielding surface-bound perylene via an imide linkage. Transflection infrared (IR) spectroscopy of the carbonyl vibrational region elucidated the presence of anhydride, imide, and ester species following each reaction stage. The presence of both anhydride and imide IR features following reaction with PTCDA validates successful perylene attachment. Subsequent functionalization of the surface-attached perylenes yielded IR spectra with little or no detectable anhydride features that indicate successful conversion to ester or imide species based on respective reactions with alkyl bromides or aryl amines. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy quantified fractional coverages of surface-attached perylene species following a post-deposition derivatization with fluorine-containing alkyl bromides and with anilines. Overlayer model interpretation of the photoelectron results determined a perylene surface coverage of similar to 15% relative to the surface density of Si(111) atop sites and a similar to 10% surface coverage of imideterminated perylene species. The interpreted coverage data yield an approximate conversion efficiency for the anhydride-toimide derivatization at surface-attached perylenes of similar to 66%.

Their complex transient photophysics, in time scales ranging from femtoseconds to seconds, have been widely investigated. However, in most of the reported works the spectral window of ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy of perovskite films is limited to the visible region, hence missing crucial information coming from the near-infrared (NIR). Furthermore, the measured TA responses are affected by light interference in a thin perovskite layer making data interpretation a challenge even in the visible part of the spectrum. Here, we demonstrate a method that allows us to separately obtain the changes in absorption and refractive index from conventional transmission and reflection pump-probe measurements. We show that the contribution of the absorption change to the response of metal halide perovskite thin films in the NIR is much smaller than that of the refractive index change. Furthermore, the spectral shape of TA responses in the NIR range is predominantly determined by perovskite layer thickness and its refractive index.

The interfaces within PSCs, especially the two key interfaces related to the perovskite (electron transport layer/perovskite and perovskite/hole transport layer), play a vital role in their overall performance and stability since they are especially susceptible to external stimuli. Herein, high efficiency planar PSCs were fabricated, and the property evolution of the above-mentioned two key interfaces was real-time dynamically traced via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results indicate that the two interfaces under a small bias are variable, and even last for hours due to ion migration within the PSCs. Specifically, the charge transfer resistance of the two interfaces and the bulk charge transport resistance of the perovskite layer continually increased, while their capacitances (interfacial and dielectric) displayed non-linear changes. Subsequently, ion accumulation occurred at the two interfaces due to electromigration, and a gradual variation in the dielectric property of the perovskite layer was observed at a definite stage and reached a steady state finally. Interestingly, the impedance characteristics could recover within hours after the bias was removed, indicating that ion migration is reversible within PSCs. Therefore, the ""soft interface"" mechanism was proposed to well elucidate the unique attributes of PSCs.

The bandgap of these alloys significantly deviates from the linear interpolation between the bandgaps of APbI(3) and ASnI(3) for all A-site cations examined thus far. This non-linearity of the bandgap with composition is referred to as bandgap bowing. Here, we explore a wide-range of A-site compositions to understand bandgap bowing and identify the optimal Pb-Sn alloy composition. Optical and structural investigations of different APb(1-x)Sn(x)I(3) alloys reveal that the bandgap bowing is correlated with the extent of microstrain in their respective APbI(3) compounds. We discover that bandgap bowing in APb(1-x)Sn(x)I(3) alloys is primarily due to local structural relaxation effects (changes in bond angles and lengths) that result from the size, shape, and charge distribution of the cations on the A-site, and that these effects are intimately coupled with chemical effects (intermixing of atomic orbitals) that result from changes in the M-site. The choice of X-site also impacts bandgap bowing because of the X-site anions' influence on local structural relaxation and chemical effects. Further, we extend these results to provide a general rationale for the origin and modulation of bandgap bowing in HP alloys. Subsequently, using high-throughput combinational spray coating and photoluminescence analysis, we find that ternary combinations of methylammonium (MA), formamidinium (FA), and cesium (Cs) are beneficial to improve the optoelectronic quality of APb(1-x)Sn(x)I(3) alloys.

A surprising revelation in 2014 about the beneficial effects of controlled humidity in enhancing device efficiencies overthrew established paradigms on perovskite solar cell fabrication. Despite the extensive studies on water additives in perovskite solar cell processing that followed, detailed understanding of the role of water from the photophysical perspective remains lacking; specifically, the interplay between the induced morphological effects and the intrinsic recombination pathways. Through ultrafast optical spectroscopy, we show that both the monomolecular and bimolecular recombination rate constants decrease by approximately 1 order with the addition of an optimal 1% H2O by volume in CH3NH3PbI3 as compared to the reference (without the H2O additive). Correspondingly, the trap density reduces from 4.8 x 10(17) cm(-3) (reference) to 3.2 X 10(17) cm(-3) with 1% H2O. We obtained an efficiency of 12.3% for the champion inverted CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cell (1% H2O additive) as compared to the 10% efficiency for the reference cell. Increasing the H2O content further is deleterious for the device. Trace amounts of H2O afford the benefits of surface trap passivation and suppression of trap-mediated recombination, whereas higher concentrations result in a preferential dissolution of methylammonium iodide during fabrication that increases the trap density (MA vacancies).

The optical band-gap values were considerably decreased gradually from 4.43 to 2.16 eV with Pb doping content while maintaining high optical transmittance in the visible wavelength range. Density functional theory calculations showed that the narrowing of band gap was attributed to a finite overlap between Pb 6s and Sn 5s orbitals around the bottom of the conduction band. As doping with 5% La in SSPO films, the electrical conductivity was improved greatly, and transport properties were investigated through temperature-dependent resistivity and Hall measurements. A lowest room-temperature resistivity of 0.5 m Omega cm and a maximum mobility of 39.9 cm(2)/Vs were observed in 5% La in the SSPO film at x = 1.

Adding either Cs+ or Rb+ is shown to alter the solidification process of the perovskite films.

However, halide perovskites also exhibit large nuclear anharmonic effects and disorder, which is unusual for efficient optoelectronic materials and difficult to rationalize in view of the small Urbach energies that indicate a low amount of disorder. To address this important issue, the disorder potential induced for electronic states by the nuclear dynamics in various paradigmatic halide perovskites is studied with molecular dynamics and density functional theory. We find that the disorder potential is dynamically shortened due to the nuclear motions in the perovskite, such that it is short-range correlated, which is shown to lead to favorable distributions of band edge energies.

This work reports the substrate effects on the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in perovskite films through thermal expansion under thermal annealing. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements show that using a flexible polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) substrate introduces a smaller mechanical strain in perovskite MAPbI(3-x)Cl(x) films, as compared to conventional glass substrates. Interestingly, the linear/circular photoexcitation-modulated photocurrent studies find that decreasing mechanical strain gives rise to a weaker orbit-orbit interaction toward decreasing the SOC in the MAPbI(3-x)Cl(x) films prepared on flexible PEN substrates relative to rigid glass substrates. Simultaneously, decreasing the mechanical strain causes a reduction in the internal magnetic parameter inside the MAPbI(3-x)Cl(x) films, providing further evidence to show that introducing mechanical strain can affect the SOC in hybrid perovskite films upon using flexible substrates toward developing flexible perovskite thin-film devices.

In addition, it is often unclear as to whether the incorporation of such cation sources is inducing ""doping"" or simply transformed into cationic oxides on the surface of the photoelectrodes. In this study, TiO2 nanofibers were produced through a simple electrospinning technique and modified by introducing lithium and lanthanum precursors in one step. Our results show that the addition of both cations caused minimal substitutional or interstitial doping of TiO2. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller measurements showed that lanthanum-treated TiO2 nanofibers had an increase in surface area, which even exceeded that of TiO2 P25 nanoparticles. Finally, treated and untreated TiO2 nanofibers were used in n-i-p solar cells. Photovoltaic characteristics revealed that lanthanum treatment was beneficial, whereas lithium treatment was found to be detrimental to the device performance for both dye-sensitized and perovskite solar cells.

Using our simulation model, we investigated the effect of interface and bulk traps, mobility, doping of the charge transport layers and contact workfunctions to the power conversion efficiency.

We found that the traps at the interfaces and in the bulk perovskite films are the most important factor hampering the tandem cell efficiency. We predicted up to 29.8% efficiency for a device with recombination losses. By changing the mobility in the active material of the bottom cell we found that, the mobility plays an important role in determining the optimum thicknesses of the top and the bottom cells.

It is placed near the largest Astronomical Observatory of Argentina: Complejo AStrondmico El LEOncito (CASLEO). Its advantages are: a good altitude to detect the maximum development of cosmic ray showers, high spectral transmittance to UV and visible ranges, very low aerosol content (mean particle concentration measured at ground with an optical particle counter PM2.5 = 1.52 mu g m(-3) and PM>2 5 = 6.83 mu g m(-3), mean Aerosol Optical Depth at 550 nm = 0.027 (measured from space using the SeaWiFS instrument on board of the SeaStar NASA satellite). A local meteorological analysis was done, using data measured in situ, which shows a typical desertic site with the following mean annual (std. dev.) values:mean annual temperature 18.93 (7.66) degrees C, mean annual relative humidity 28.76 (20.55)%, low/moderate mean annual average wind speed 11.63 (8.78) km/h, low mean water content (0.73 cm) and rather low mean cloud coverage fraction (cloud coverage fraction): 0.29 (0.02) (for the period 2003-2016 from Aqua/NASA satellite MODIS device) and 0.25 (0.01) (for the period 2000-2016, Terra/NASA satellite MODIS device). Concerning the conditions for the placement of photovoltaic solar power plants, some positive aspects that can be remarked are a large rather flat available surface (336 km(2)) with very good levels of annual mean horizontal solar irradiation: Global (2334 kWh m(-2) per year), Direct (3127 kWh m(-2) per year) and Diffuse (394 kWh m(-2) per year). Optimum angle to place solar panels at this site is determined and the global tilted solar irradiation is calculated (2689 kWh m(-2) per year). In comparison with an African (Ouarzazate, Morocco) and Asian (Dubai) sites, the analysed site present better annual irradiation levels being the Global horizontal irradiation at the Argentinean site 8.1% and 10.3% higher than those calculated for the African and Asian site respectively. Also, a comparison is made of different solar cells (monocrystalline Si, polycrystalline Si and perovskite), through the calculation of the generated photocurrent (mean produced solar photovoltaic current per unit cell surface), considering the atmospheric and solar radiation parameters found for the studied site. We thus conclude that the proposed site in the Andes range is well suited for the placement of Astrophysical facilities, as well as Photovoltaic solar power plants.

In this review, we summarize recent mechanical studies of the known HOIPs. Firstly, we present a comprehensive account of the relationship between crystal structures and properties, where the influence of different chemical and bonding factors on the load response of HOIPs are extensively discussed. The functional abnormalities of HOIP materials under the stress stimuli are also reviewed, addressing the effects of negative linear compressibility, negative Poisson's ratio and barocaloric effect. Finally, we briefly summarize the significant effect of strain and stress in thin-film halide perovskite materials, which have been widely employed in solar cells and Light-emitting diodes.

A major challenge for 21st century scientists is finding novel strategies, concepts and materials for replacing silicon-based CMOS semiconductor technologies and guaranteeing a continued and steady technological progress in next decades. Among the materials classes candidate to contribute to this momentous challenge, oxide films and heterostructures are a particularly appealing hunting ground. The vastity, intended in pure chemical terms, of this class of compounds, the complexity of their correlated behaviour, and the wealth of functional properties they display, has already made these systems the subject of choice, worldwide, of a strongly networked, dynamic and interdisciplinary research community. Oxide science and technology has been the target of a wide four-year project, named Towards Oxide-Based Electronics (TO-BE), that has been recently running in Europe and has involved as participants several hundred scientists from 29 EU countries. In this review and perspective paper, published as a final deliverable of the TO-BE Action, the opportunities of oxides as future electronic materials for Information and Communication Technologies ICT and Energy are discussed. The paper is organized as a set of contributions, all selected and ordered as individual building blocks of a wider general scheme. After a brief preface by the editors and an introductory contribution, two sections follow. The first is mainly devoted to providing a perspective on the latest theoretical and experimental methods that are employed to investigate oxides and to produce oxide-based films, heterostructures and devices.

It can act as a promising alternative; however, there are still some serious concerns regarding its suitability. This presents a major challenge; viable metal cations have to be identified. A good number of elements, originating from a large range of d-block metal ions, with adequate oxidation states, moderate toxicity, and relative abundance, seem ideal for this purpose. In this review, we present the most characteristic perovskites (conventional perovskites, layered, or double perovskites) that can be formed with the help of these metals. We focus on d-block metal ions with stable oxidation states, such as Ag+ or Ti4+, which have exhibited satisfactory photovoltaic properties until now.

Besides, in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on organic hole transport layers, the low conduction band minimum (CBM) of FAMA perovskites would lead to small open circuit voltage (V-oc) (similar to 1.0 V), and thus additional surface passivation/modification layers are normally employed, indicating that it is essential to improve the basic precursors for high quality perovskite films. Herein, the proposed method is realized via ternary precursor alloying which endows the perovskite with increased grain size, enhanced crystallinity, reduced trap states, and a pure photoactive phase without the assistance of CsI. Without passivation/modification layers, the device V-oc is enhanced markedly from 1.0 V to 1.1 V on average, and a champion power conversion efficiency of 20.7% with negligible hysteresis is achieved. Moreover, as they are free of hydrophilic CsI, both the photoactive perovskite films and devices exhibit excellent stability in ambient air.

Here we investigate the nature of the excited state and its relation to pathways for electronic and lattice relaxations by performing time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT). Charge density response upon photoexcitation close to the band edge and deeper into the absorption spectra are investigated for three lead perovskite compounds with different A-site monovalent cations CsPbI3, CH2(NH2)(2)PbI3 (FAPbI(3)), and CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI(3)). The carrier cooling mechanism is analyzed and shows that the initial force acting on the nuclei follows the symmetry of the ground-state electronic structure upon photoexcitation with a force parallel to the polarization of the incoming light. This effect is investigated for the three different compounds and shows an initial force for induced ionic movement that depends on both the underlying symmetry of the inorganic lattice as well as on the type and orientation of the organic cation. The excess energy after thermalization under blue-light illumination is large enough for overcoming the activation energy for iodide migration and can thus trigger vacancy formation. Iodide vacancies are seen to be dipole-field compensated by the organic cation, with a shielding of the local field, and thus form an explanation for the defect tolerance found in these systems under photovoltaic operation. A partial charge transfer from the inorganic cage to the monovalent organic cation is predicted with TDDFT calculations for blue- and UV-light illumination with a population of antibinding orbitals in the N-H bond in both CH3NH3 (MA) and CH2(NH2)(2 )(FA), where the implication for this is discussed in terms of the intrinsic photo stability of organic cation containing lead perovskites. The results show the importance of a fundamental understanding of the excited-state properties of perovskite material to reveal the underlying mechanism for the defect tolerance and thus high photovoltaic performance when using organic dipolar cations as well as a rationale for using mixed halide perovskites to decrease the halide migration, effect of vacancy formation, and stability issues under blueand UV-light illumination.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2469-9950,2469-9969,,,,12-Jul,2019,100,4,,,,,,,45203,10.1103/PhysRevB.100.045203,,,,,,,,WOS:000475499700006,,,,,

Due to their potential to achieve high carrier mobilities, organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite materials can enable high-performance, solution-processed field-effect transistors (FETs) for next-generation, low-cost, flexible electronic circuits and displays. However, the performance of perovskite FETs is hampered predominantly by device instabilities, whose origin remains poorly understood. Here, perovskite single-crystal FETs based on methylammonium lead bromide are studied and device instabilities due to electrochemical reactions at the interface between the perovskite and gold source-drain top contacts are investigated. Despite forming the contacts by a gentle, soft lamination method, evidence is found that even at such ""ideal"" interfaces, a defective, intermixed layer is formed at the interface upon biasing of the device. Using a bottom-contact, bottom-gate architecture, it is shown that it is possible to minimize such a reaction through a chemical modification of the electrodes, and this enables fabrication of perovskite single-crystal FETs with high mobility of up to approximate to 15 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) at 80 K.

Selective injection of holes through electrochemical anodic bias has allowed us to probe the effect of hole trapping at iodide (0.9 V) and bromide (1.15 V) in mixed halide perovskite (CH3NH3PbB1.5I1.5) films. Upon trapping holes at the iodide site, the iodide gradually gets expelled from the mixed halide film (as iodine and/or triiodide ion), leaving behind re-formed CH3NH3PbBr3 domains. The weakening of the Pb-I bond following the hole trapping (oxidation of the iodide site) and its expulsion from the lattice in the form of iodine provided further insight into the photoinduced segregation of halide ions in mixed halide perovskite films. Transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that the iodide expulsion process leaves a defect-rich perovskite lattice behind as charge carrier recombination in the re-formed lattice is greatly accelerated.

In this paper, we demonstrate the direct formed tri-iodide ions stabilizing colloidal precursor solution for efficient halide perovskite solar cells. The added I-2 molecules dissolved in perovskite precursor sustain the dynamic balance between I- ions and I-3(-) ions by the reversible reaction: I- + I-2 (sic) I-3(-), which effectively stabilizes the whole I- ion concentration in perovskite solution and prevents the colloidal particles from aggregation.

The adverse shell ligands and unstable core lattices are known as the fundamental problems. In order to address this issue, here proposed is a rational core-shell design: 1) with respect to ligands, a new one, 4-fluorophenethylammonium iodide, is used to enhance bonding force and charge coupling between ligands and nanocrystals; 2) with respect to lattices, a novel compound H2PbI4 is employed to assist divalent ion (Mn2+) doping into perovskite lattices. By low temperature in situ processing CsPbI3 quasi-nanocrystal film, the highest power conversion efficiency of 13.4% for p-i-n solar cells is achieved, which retains 92% after 500 h in ambient air.

Here, interfacial structure and transport properties of CH3NH3PbI3/SnO2 interfaces are investigated comprehensively by density functional theory and experiment. Forming CH3NH3PbI3/SnO2 interfaces weakens the gap states induced by CH3NH3PbI3 surfaces. The interfacial transport properties are strongly dependent on the interface atomic configurations. The CH3NH3PbI3/SnO2 interface with PbI and O terminations is more beneficial for hole blocking and electron transporting due to the largest valence band offset compared to the CH3NH3PbI3/SnO2 interface with other terminations. Moreover, it exhibits a larger electrostatic potential difference compared with CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 interface, leading to the higher electron transfer efficiency. Hence, higher power conversion efficiency is achieved based on CH3NH3PbI3/SnO2 compared to CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 structure in experiments. In addition, CH3NH3PbI3/SnO2 interfaces with PbI terminations are more stable than those with CH3NH3I terminations, suggesting PbI2 layer may be preferentially formed on SnO2 substrate during CH3NH3PbI3 fabrication process.

For third-generation solar cells of organolead halide perovskites, the monofacial power conversion efficiency (PCE) has exceeded 23%. Therefore, the development of efficient bifacial cells is expected, but the top transparent electrode is a crucial obstacle that must be overcome. In this work, ultrathin silver (Ag) film was selected as the top transparent electrode and, particularly, a tellurium oxide (TeO2) optical coupling layer was adopted to enhance the transmittance of the Ag film in the visible light region, which markedly increased the light absorption of devices. Compared with PSCs with a pure Ag electrode, the device with a TeO2 (40 nm)/Ag (11 nm) top electrode showed significantly enhanced bifacial short-circuit current-density and bifacial PCEs of 18.86% (illuminated from the ITO electrode) and 15.12% (illuminated from the Ag electrode). Consequently, in addition to its role as a transmittance enhancement layer, TeO2 acted as a back reflector when the device was illuminated from the ITO side. Furthermore, a previously proposed phenylethylammonium iodide treatment method was adopted to improve charge transport at the perovskite/fullerene interface. Remarkably, the device achieved champion bifacial PCEs of 20.96% (ITO side) and 17.36% (Ag side), a bifaciality factor of 82.82%, and a steady PCE output and good reproducibility. The large-area device (1 cm(2)) achieved bifacial PCEs of 12.42% (ITO side) and 10.55% (Ag side), with better performance predicted by simulations.

The most critical hindrance to the photovoltaic performance of LC-PSCs is the inferior contact between the perovskite and carbon layers.

Micro- Raman spectroscopy is used to identify the various modes of metal-oxide bonds in the system.

Because of these additional interactions, the penetration depth of the organic layer into the perovskite sheet is reduced with direct consequences for its crystalline phase. The possibility of forming strong interlinker hydrogen bonds may lead to an enhanced thermal stability.",,,,,"Rothlisberger, Ursula/0000-0002-1704-8591; Jahanbakhshi, Farzaneh/0000-0001-7113-2746",,,,,,,,,,,,1948-7185,,,,,4-Jul,2019,10,13,,,,,3543,3549,,10.1021/acs.jpclett.9b01111,,,,,,,,WOS:000474812600006,31194558,,,,

In addition, defect states within the semiconductor band gap respond to such stimuli. Although extensively used, capacitive methods have found difficulties when applied to elucidating bulk defect bands in photovoltaic perovskites. This is because perovskite solar cells (PSCs) actually exhibit some intriguing capacitive features hardly connected to electronic defect dynamics. The commonly reported excess capacitance observed at low frequencies is originated by outer interface mechanisms and has a direct repercussion on the evaluation of band gap defect levels. Starting by updating previous observations on Mott-Schottky analysis in PSCs, it is discussed how the thermal admittance spectroscopy and the deep level transient spectroscopy characterization techniques present spectra with overlapping or even ""fake"" peaks caused by the mobile ion-related, interfacial excess capacitance.

The versatile structures of 2D perovskites enable fine-tuning of their optoelectronic properties. Newly reported Dion Jacobson (DJ) perovskites have shown superior out-of-plane charge transport properties and better stability than the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP)-type perovskites because of their freedom from weak van der Waals interactions between adjacent layers. Tunable band gaps of 2D AMX(4) can be achieved by alternatively substituting the corresponding compositions at A, M, and X sites, and significantly enhanced stability is observed because of the two hydrogen bonds formed at both ends of the divalent organic cation. Enhanced interlayer charge transport properties are found in DJ perovskites because of the short apical I-I distance in AMX(4) perovskites, especially for PDAPbI(4) and PDASnI(4) perovskites.

By rapidly transferring single charge carriers instead of bound triplet states, perovskites enable a high triplet population in rubrene, yielding low I-th values. In this contribution, we investigate the role of the triplet population on the upconverted emission. Interestingly, two independent rates of TTA can be observed, as well as a sharp drop in the visible emission intensity over several seconds. This effect can be attributed to the triplet-density-based diffusion length: (i) at low triplet populations slow diffusion-mediated TTA yields singlets far from the interface and (ii) higher triplet populations lead to rapid TTA close to the perovskite/rubrene interface. Because of the proximity of the strongly absorbing perovskite, the singlet states created closer to the interface undergo stronger back-transfer to the perovskite film and therefore appear to exhibit a lower photoluminescence quantum yield.",,,,,"VanOrman, Zachary/0000-0002-7773-012X; Nienhaus, Lea/0000-0003-1412-412X",,,,,,,,,,,,1948-7185,,,,,4-Jul,2019,10,13,,,,,3806,3811,,10.1021/acs.jpclett.9b01526,,,,,,,,WOS:000474812600043,31244265,,,,

Through analyses of time-resolved crystal formation kinetics obtained from synchrotron X-rays with a fast subsecond probing time resolution, an important ""catalytic"" role of the seed-like PbS NCs is clearly elucidated. The perovskite precursor-capped PbS NCs are found to not only accelerate the nucleation of a highly oriented intermediate phase, but also catalyze the conversion of the intermediate phase into perovskite crystals with a reduced activation energy E-a = 47 (+/- 5) kJ mol(-1), compared to 145 (+/- 38) kJ mol(-1) for the pristine perovskite thin film. The reduced E-a is attributed to a designated crystal lattice alignment of the perovskite nanocrystals with perovskite cubic crystals; the pivotal heterointerface alignment of the perovskite crystals coordinated by the Pb NCs leads to an improved film surface morphology with less pinholes and enhanced crystal texture and thermal stability.
