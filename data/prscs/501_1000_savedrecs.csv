All these experimental data sets are successfully reproduced by a charge drift-diffusion simulation model incorporating mobile ions and charge traps using a single set of parameters. While previous modeling studies focused on a single experimental technique, we combine steady-state, transient, and frequency-domain simulations and measurements. Our study is an important step toward quantitative simulation of perovskite solar cells, leading to a deeper understanding of the physical effects in these materials. The analysis of the transient current upon voltage turn-on in the dark reveals that the charge injection properties of the interfaces are triggered by the accumulation of mobile ionic defects. We show that the current rise of voltage step experiments allow for conclusions about the recombination at the interface. Whether one or two mobile ionic species are used in the model has only a minor influence on the observed effects. A delayed current rise observed upon reversing the bias from +3 to -3 V in the dark cannot be reproduced yet by our drift-diffusion model. We speculate that a reversible chemical reaction of mobile ions with the contact material may be the cause of this effect, thus requiring a future model extension.

However, the lagging quantum yields of blue-emitting perovskite NCs have resulted in low efficiency compared to green or red perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs); moreover, the long insulating ligands (such as oleylamine and oleic acid) inhibit charge carrier injection. In this study, we demonstrated a facile ligand-mediated post-treatment (LMPT) method for high-quality perovskite NCs with changing optical properties to allow fine-tuning of the target emission wavelength. This method involves the use of a mixed halide ion-pair ligand, di-dodecyl dimethyl ammonium bromide, and chloride, which can induce a reconstruction through a self-anion exchange. Using the LMPT method, the PLQY of the surface-passivated blue-emitting NCs was dramatically enhanced to over 70% within the 485 nm blue emission region and 50% within the 467 nm deep-blue emission region.

One-step coaxial perovskite/TPU nanofibers had a high photoluminescence quantum yield value exceeding 23.3%, surpassing that of its uniaxial counterpart, due to the homogeneous distribution of perovskite nanoparticles (NPs) by the confinement of the TPU shell. The fabricated core shell nanofibers exhibited a high mechanical endurance owing to the well elastic properties of TPU and maintained the luminescence intensity even under a 100% stretched state after 1000 stretching relaxing cycles. By taking advantage of the hydrophobic nature of TPU, the ambient and moisture stability of the fabricated fibers were enhanced up to 1 month. Besides, large-area stretchable nanofibers with a dimension of 15 cm x 30 cm exhibiting various visible-light emission peaks were fabricated by changing the composition of perovskite NPs.

This partially dissolves the small crystals in the perovskite intermediate and reduces nucleation density. The small crystals recrystallize into larger sizes via a dissolution-crystallization mechanism, leading to a reduction in the grain boundaries and interfacial defects. Preannealing is also crucial in solubility control and for tuning the crystallization. Crystal-size-dependent optical band gaps may be attributed to a weak quantum confinement effect. Excess PbI2 residue is induced at the perovskite surface thanks to the selective solubility of IBA, which improves the passivation of the perovskite surface.

Its photovoltaic performance and stability are comparable to the reference PSC based on the ITO electrodes (PCE = 15.70%), which demonstrates that the Ni/Au mesh transparent electrodes are a promising ITO alternative to fabricate efficient PSCs. The relatively lower performance of Ni/Au based PSC results from the relatively slower charge extraction and stronger charge recombination than the ITO based PSC. Further, we tried to fabricate the large area (1 cm(2)) device and achieve a PCE over 6% with negligible hysteresis and steady current density and PCE outputs.

Additionally, it usually undergoes phase transition to the nonperovskite structure phase (beta-CsPbI3), which results in poor photoelectric performance in devices. In this study, it is first found that the tortuous 3D CsPbI3 phase (gamma-CsPbI3) can be prepared and used for PSCs by solution process without any additive at low temperature (60 degrees C). The gamma-CsPbI3 exhibits suitable bandgap of 1.75 eV and favorable photoelectric properties. However, gamma-CsPbI3 is a metastable phase and easily transforms into beta-CsPbI3 in ambient moisture.

The resulting changes were analyzed in detail. Unlike what occurs when CH3NH3PbI3 is deposited onto bare ITO or PEDOT:PSS, the long-lived (from micro-millisecond) charge separations are observed when the NiOx is used as the HTL.

Recent studies have pointed out the extraordinary luminescence quantum yield in perovskite materials. The concept of photon recycling investigated in this work promises a route to reharvest the radiatively emitted photons and, thus, lead to an increase in the open-circuit voltage in perovskite solar cells. In this light, this work investigates the role of nanostructured perovskite absorber layers. While the change of the open-circuit voltage due to photon recycling is understood at a conceptional level, the actual impact of a nanostructured interface on the photon recycling has not yet been studied quantitatively. Here, we rely on full-wave optical simulations to quantify the impact of photon recycling on the open-circuit voltage in a nanotextured biperiodic perovskite thin-film layer and additionally with the perovskite layer integrated into a complete solar cell multilayer stack. The validity of the optical simulations is confirmed by far-field measurements of the emission characteristics from fabricated devices. We find that the considered nanostructure provides around 2% increase to a typically achievable open-circuit voltage in perovskite solar cells. We thereby show that, while the main focus for the design of nanostructures is the optimization of light harvesting, photon recycling might be of interest in future designs of solar cell devices.

Nevertheless, the unsatisfactory device stability and current-voltage hysteresis normally observed with most PSCs under operational conditions are the bottlenecks that restrict the application of this photovoltaic technology in practice. It is known that interface properties are at the heart of an electronic device's performance. Understanding the interactions occurring at the interfaces is important to design and develop effective strategies to address these issues associated with PSCs. In this review, we summarize the most recent advancement in understanding the interfaces in PSCs, in particular the interfaces of perovskite/electron transport layer (ETL) and perovskite/hole transport layer (HTL). Our main interest is to provide guidance on the immense complexity of dynamic behaviours of PSCs, particularly concerning the slowest time scale measurements that have a maximum impact on the actual operation of the solar cell. Therefore we address the separation of phenomena such as ion migration, interfacial charge accumulation, and surface electrochemical reactions. We provide an analysis of electrooptical small perturbation methods, including impedance spectroscopy (IS), and a description of negative capacitance, as well as spatially resolved techniques. The impact of different contacts with variable morphology and composition on the perovskite/ETL and perovskite/HTL interface properties reflected by the kinetics of charge transport and chemical reactions is discussed to provide deep insights into the operational mechanism of PSCs.

However, due to the highly ionic nature of perovskite crystals, even phase stabilized polycrystalline perovskites can undergo undesirable phase transitions when exposed to a destabilizing environment. While various surface passivating agents have been developed to improve the device performance of perovskite solar cells, conventional deposition methods using a protic polar solvent, mainly isopropyl alcohol (IPA), results in a destabilization of the underlying perovskite layer and an undesirable degradation of device properties. We demonstrate the hidden role of IPA in surface treatments and develop a strategy in which the passivating agent is deposited without destabilizing the high quality perovskite underlayer. This strategy maximizes and stabilizes device performance by suppressing the formation of the perovskite delta-phase and amorphous phase during surface treatment, which is observed using conventional methods. Our strategy also effectively passivates surface and grain boundary defects, minimizing non-radiative recombination sites, and preventing carrier quenching at the perovskite interface. This results in an open-circuit-voltage loss of only similar to 340 mV, a champion device with a power conversion efficiency of 23.4% from a reverse current-voltage scan, a device with a record certified stabilized PCE of 22.6%, and enhanced operational stability.

To analyze the photovoltaic characteristics and transmittance of the TiO2 layer of the PSCs according to the GO content, solar simulator and ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared spectroscopy were used, respectively. Atomic force microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscope were used to analyze the microstructures of both the TiO2 layer and the perovskite layer.

The highest ECE was observed at a GO content of 0.5 wt%, and a decrease in the ECE was confirmed at higher levels. The increase in ECE was confirmed by measuring short circuit current density (J(sc)) and shunt resistance which increased with the GO addition. However, when an excessive amount of GO content was added, a decrease in the ECE was observed, due to the decrease in J(sc) by the reduction in transmittance. In particular, an increase in the perovskite crystal size caused an increase in the ECE, due to the increased rms of TiO2 at 0.5 wt% GO. With the 0.7 wt% GO TiO2 layer, the perovskite grain size was decreased by the reduction in rms, and this resulted in a decrease in J(sc) and ECE. These results suggest that we might improve the efficiency of perovskite solar cells by adding the proper amount of GO to the TiO2 layer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1738-8228,,,,,JUL,2019,57,7,,,,,456,461,,10.3365/KJMM.2019.57.7.456,,,,,,,,WOS:000477929600007,,,,,

In this work, instead of the solution-processed NiOx, metal Ni is first deposited on the FTO/glass substrate by an e-beam evaporator and then converted to the NiOx by exposing it in the air with the help of annealing, which avoids the usage of a toxic solvent in the solution method.

It is revealed that pinholes in one-step solution-processed CsPbIBr2 film will not form detrimental shutting paths in the ultimate cell when the film is relatively thick (similar to 700 nm).

Consequently, the cells based on CsPbIBr2 films containing benign pinholes yield the outstanding efficiency of 9.06%, which is much higher than that of the ones based on the films without pinholes (6.19%).

TiO2 film treated by CO2 plasma demonstrates a more low-density of defect state in both of surface and bulk than the as-fabricated one. Consequently, the efficiency of PSC is significantly improved from 16.47% of the PSC with the as-fabricated ETL to 18.10% of the PSC with the treated ETL.

However, the lifetime and instability of device characteristics are real issues to understand and solve before scaling up and commercialisation of these devices. Researchers have attempted to understand the hysteresis behaviour of current-voltage (I-V) curves in terms of mechanisms such as migration of several ions across the device and the effects of electronic defects during measurements. This review contributes to this scientific debate by presenting similar behaviour observed and reported for devices based on inorganic semiconductors. In established inorganic semiconductor thin film solar cells, both short lifetime and hysteresis have been observed, described and understood in terms of effects of numerous electronic defect levels. Therefore, the situation may be very similar and it is important to identify and reduce defects to remove this un-desirable behaviour from perovskite solar cells. After considering the wealth of experimental results reported in the literature, the conclusion made is the dominating mechanism of I-V hysteresis is due to electronic defects available within the device structure. Suggestions have been made for potential researchers to experimentally investigate the phenomenon in order to finally put an end to this debate.

Of note, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on these materials have attained efficiencies exceeding 20% with emission in either red or green colour. However, the toxicity of lead ions would raise potential risks to users and the environment. Herein, it is desirable to replace lead with sustainable and non-toxic elements. In this work, we show that the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and electroluminescence (EL) efficiencies in CsPbBr3 perovskite can be dramatically improved upon partial replacement of lead ions with magnesium ones. The perovskite films with magnesium incorporation display improved film morphology and better crystallinity. Simulation results indicate a higher defect formation energy upon incorporating magnesium. As a result, an enhanced PLQY and a longer photoluminescence lifetime are obtained in the magnesium incorporated halide perovskite film. Time-resolved spectroscopy and transient absorption are used to conduct a detailed analysis of the recombination pathways, and a reduction in non-radiative loss is observed, in conjunction with a significant decrease in the drop of carrier density in the first few picoseconds-from 60% to 10%-that is often associated with trap filling. In addition, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy measurement indicates that the hole injection barrier is dramatically reduced with magnesium. Under optimized conditions, perovskite LEDs based on CsPb0.9Mg0.1Br3 achieved a high luminance of 25 450 cd m(-2) and a current efficiency of 13.13 cd A(-1), which is enhanced by approximately 100-fold compared to the device without substitution.

We demonstrate that the encapsulation method based on an epoxy resin reduces the Pb leakage rate by a factor of 375 compared with the encapsulation method based on a glass cover with an ultraviolet-cured resin at the module edges.

Therefore, the analysis of thermal cycling effects on structural and electronic properties is of significant importance.

To verify this overlooked possibility, herein, an oxidized monolayer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiphene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hole transfer layer (HTL) is constructed by water rinsing followed by H2O2 oxidation. The oxidized PEDOT:PSS monolayer ensures a high charge transfer ability from perovskite to electrode, but at the same time limits in-plane charge transport. An inverted planar PSC fabricated on the oxidized PEDOT:PSS monolayer yields a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.8%, higher than 17.0% of the control device based on a pristine PEDOT:PSS monolayer. The main contribution comes from the fill factor (FF), which is as high as 82%. Characterizations indicate that the conjugation length of PEDOT chains is decreased after H2O2 oxidation, which lowers the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS HTL in the in-plane direction.

This arrangement might be induced by weak hydrogen bonds and C-H center dot center dot center dot pi (Ph) interactions in the extended structure. The emission maxima of TAPC-OMe showed a significant bathochomic shift compared to that of TAPC. A strong dependency of the oxidation potentials on the nature of the electron-donating ability of substituents was confirmed by comparing oxidation potentials with known Hammett parameters (sigma).",,,,"Wang, Dong Hwan/J-1574-2014","Wang, Dong Hwan/0000-0003-3736-3721",,,,,,,,,,,,2053-2296,,,,,JUL,2019,75,,7,,,,919,+,,10.1107/S2053229619007101,,,,,,,,WOS:000474222100012,31271380,,,,

However, the efficiency of BPSCs is still much lower than their theoretical efficiency. In general, interface band alignment is regarded as the vital factor of the BPSCs whereas only few reports on enhancing perovskite film quality. In this work, highly efficient BPSCs were fabricated by improving the crystallization process of CH3NH3PbBr3 with the assistance of anti-solvents. A new anti-solvent of diphenyl ether (DPE) was developed for its strong interaction with the solvents in the perovskite precursor solution. By using the anti-solvent of DPE, trap-state density of the CH3NH3PbBr3 film is reduced and the electron lifetime is enhanced along with the large-grain crystals compared with the samples from conventional anti-solvent of chlorobenzene. Upon preliminary optimization, the efficiencies of typical and semitransparent BPSCs are improved to as high as 9.54% and 7.51%, respectively. Optical absorption measurement demonstrates that the cell without metal electrode shows 80% transparency in the wavelength range of 550-1000 nm that is perfect for greenhouse vegetation. Considering that the cell absorbs light in the blue spectrum before 550 nm, it offers very high solar cell efficiency with only 17.8% of total photons, while over 60% of total photons can transmit through for photosynthesis if a transparent electrode can be obtained such as indium doped SnO2.

Measured complex index of refraction data were used for the materials comprising the devices, and hourly irradiance data were extracted from Version 3 of the National Solar Radiation Database. Simulations were performed for Toledo OH, Golden CO, Phoenix AZ, and New Orleans LA, and the effect of local temperature variation was also considered. The combination of irradiance and temperature variations throughout the year cause different devices to be optimal at different times of the year. Interestingly, devices constructed to maximize AM1.5 photoconversion efficiency do not necessarily maximize the annual energy yield. A detailed analysis of the monthly energy yields at the different locations reveals the interplay between the changing light and temperature conditions. Over the course of the year these effects average to some degree so that annual energy yields that are close to the maximum possible value can be achieved by several different tandem device designs. The conclusions are valid for devices made with relatively thin perovskite layers, such as those used in champion efficiency devices. When the perovskite layers are thicker, however, the device is less tolerant to variation.

In spite of stunning progress, full understanding of the operation mechanism of a PSC is still necessary to further improve device performance. In this study, due to surface roughness, interfaces between the active layers with electron and hole transfer layers were added to the study model as new d(1) and d(2) layers, respectively. The new layers were introduced as a structure, whose dielectric function is a random combination of adjacent layers. This way, by the finite-difference time-domain method, parasitic absorptions of d(1) and d(2) layers were calculated and compared with the partial absorption of the active layer. The results of this study show that the parasitic absorption due to surface roughness between TiO2 and CH3NH3PbI3 (d(1) layer) greatly affects the partial absorption of the active layer of the cell. The parasitic absorption in this region occurs especially at the UV wavelength and near it and increases with increasing roughness in other parts of the spectrum. In contrast, the layer formed due to surface roughness between CH3NH3PbI3 and Spiro-OMeTAD (d(2) layer) is not very effective in terms of optics. The optical results of this model, along with predetermined electrical assumptions, lead to the proper description of cell behavior. This can be considered as the correctness of the simulation procedure. Therefore, this method can explain how the presence of such a d(1) layer, which is formed in the manufacturing process and is inevitable, can lead to better cell performance.",,,,,"Haidari, Gholamhosain/0000-0003-2400-9280",,,,,,,,,,,,2156-3381,,,,,JUL,2019,9,4,,,,,1046,1050,,10.1109/JPHOTOV.2019.2914919,,,,,,,,WOS:000472579000015,,,,,

A simple solution method is adopted to synthesize Fe-doped NiOx NPs and their corresponding films are deposited by spin coating using Fe-NiOx inks at room temperature without any post treatment. As the obtained Fe-doped NiOx films exhibited an improvement in conductivity and work function, they resulted in an improvement in hole extraction and charge collection, while suppressing the charge recombination.

Remarkably, the deteriorating performance of the normal structure with Li-TFSI at mpp is successfully avoided by replacing Li-TFSI with Zn-TFSI2, leading even to an increased power output with stable performance at mpp.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2211-2855,2211-3282,,,,JUL,2019,61,,,,,,126,131,,10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.04.051,,,,,,,,WOS:000471201800016,,,,,

However, wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells usually suffer from large open circuit voltage (V-oc) deficits caused by small grain sizes and photoinduced phase segregation. Here, we demonstrate that in addition to large grain sizes and passivated grain boundaries, controlling interface properties is critical for achieving high V-oc's in the inverted wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells. We adopt guanidinium bromide solution to tune the effective doping and electronic properties of the surface layer of perovskite thin films, leading to the formation of a graded perovskite homojunction. The enhanced electric field at the perovskite homojunction is revealed by Kelvin probe force microscopy measurements. This advance enables an increase in the V-oc of the inverted perovskite solar cells from an initial 1.12 V to 1.24 V. With the optimization of the device fabrication process, the champion inverted wide-bandgap cell delivers a power conversion efficiency of 18.19% and sustains more than 72% of its initial efficiency after continuous illumination for 70 h without encapsulation.

However, the substitution is limited by the Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t, 0.8 < t < 1.0), leading to the situation that the alternative deviating from the Goldschmidt rule is always overlooked, let alone utilized to enhance performance. Given this, Ba(II) is partially substituted for Pb(II) in CsPbIBr2 to investigate how the dopants-induced deviation from the Goldschmidt rule would affect perovskite property. Intriguingly, the result verifies that Ba(II) enables increased the grain size and enhances the crystallinity of CsPbIBr2. As such, the trap state density is reduced and the non-radiative recombination in the perovskite is suppressed. These advantages bring about an increase of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of Ba(II)-doped devices to 10.51%, outperforming that (8.4%) of the pristine counterpart.

The reported power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the s-NiOx based PVSCs span a wide range from 8% to over 20% even with a similar recipe. Here, we report that one of the causes for the performance discrepancy might be the large surface dipole on the s-NiOx surface. We find that the perovskite deposited on the as-prepared sol-gel derived s-NiOx has large number of defects at the s-NiOx/perovskite interface. Based on the in-depth mechanism study with various spectroscopy techniques, we propose that the strong surface dipole of the s-NiOx composite film induces adhesion of perovskite precursor ions on the surface of s-NiOx during the perovskite film formation and creates defects in the perovskite crystals at the interface. Such interfacial dipole-ion attachment has been demonstrated can be dissociated by ultraviolet (UV) light soaking experiment. The high energy of the UV light helps to dissociate the physical dipole-ion attachment and mobilize the ions to accommodate the perovskite defect sites. The defect density of the perovskite film on s-NiOx has been significantly reduced by an amount of 4.1 x 10(17) cm(-3) after the UV light soaking as evidenced by photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS) measurement. By treating the s-NiOx surface with a dipolar molecule n-Butylamine, the surface dipole of the s-NiOx film is efficiently reduced and it significantly reduces the defect density in the perovskite film. As a result, the PVSCs based on the n-Butylamine treated s-NiOx layer have achieved a dramatical enhancement in PCE to 18.9% with decent stability at the maximum power point tracking.

The formamidine-based Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites were direct bandgap materials, with the experimental bandgaps of over 1.7eV, and whose average photoluminescence lifetimes were affected by their chemical components and crystal structures. In addition, planar perovskite solar cells were fabricated by employing these films as absorbing layers. The initial devices from the (BA)(2)(FA)(3)Pb4I13 precursors exhibited an efficiency of 2.88% and an open voltage of 0.93V. These results indicated that the formation and stability of 2D-structured perovskites were strongly related to the A-site cations, thus offering new insights into the structures of 2D perovskites and their applications for 2D-3D-structured perovskite solar cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-7820,1551-2916,,,,JUL,2019,102,7,,,,,4152,4160,,10.1111/jace.16284,,,,,,,,WOS:000469290900038,,,,,

Conventionally, ZnO nanostructures used for gas-sensing have been usually prepared via chemical route, where the 3D/2D nanostructures are chemically synthesized and subsequently plated on an appropriate substrate. However, using pulsed laser ablation technique, the ZnO nanostructures are structurally designed and grown directly on a substrate using a two-step temperature-pressure seeding approach. This approach has been optimized to design various ZnO nanostructures by understanding the effect of substrate temperature in the 300-750 degrees C range under O-2 gas pressure from 10-mTorr to 10 Torr. Using a thin ZnO seed layer as template that is deposited first at substrate temperature of 300 degrees C at background oxygen pressure of 10 mTorr on Si(100), ZnO nanostructures, such as nanoworms, nanowalls, and nanorods (with secondary flower-like growth) were grown at substrate temperatures and oxygen background pressures of (550 degrees C and 2 Torr), (550 degrees C and 0.5 Torr), and (650 degrees C and 2 Torr), respectively. The morphology and the optical properties of ZnO nanostructures were examined by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM-EDX), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), and photoluminescence (PL). The PLD-grown ZnO nanostructures are single-crystals and are highly oriented in the c-axis. The vapor-solid (VS) model is proposed to be responsible for the growth of ZnO nanostructures by PLD process. Furthermore, the ZnO nanowall structure is a very promising nanostructure due to its very high surface-to-volume ratio. Although ZnO nanowalls have been grown by other methods for sensor application, to this date, only a very few ZnO nanowalls have been grown by PLD for this purpose. In this regard, ZnO nanowall structures are deposited by PLD on an Al2O3 test sensor and assessed for their responses to CO and ethanol gases at 50 ppm, where good responses were observed at 350 and 400 degrees C, respectively. The PLD-grown ZnO nanostructures are very excellent materials for potential applications such as in dye-sensitized solar cells, perovskite solar cells and biological and gas sensors.",,,,"Khan, Aslam/B-4537-2010; Labis, Joselito/W-6215-2019","Khan, Aslam/0000-0002-7906-5653; ",,,,,,,,,,,,0002-7820,1551-2916,,,,JUL,2019,102,7,,,,,4367,4375,,10.1111/jace.16270,,,,,,,,WOS:000469290900058,,,,,

Droplet-based coating route, comprising inkjet printing, aerosol jet, and spray coating, is a viable deposition approach for high volume manufacturing of such devices.

We also analyzed the prediction power of existing scaling laws, theoretical and semi-empirical models for maximum spreading diameter with respect to droplet initial diameter, beta(max), against perovskite solution droplets. We found that for the common coated substrates used here, and also in photovoltaic devices, the relative roughness with respect to droplet size was small, and the coated substrates were quite wetting with small contact angles. Thus, the perovskite solution droplet spreading was found to be a function of the We number, according to an existing scaling law and correlation for common liquids, where the coefficient of the correlation was tuned for methylammonium perovskite solution droplets by curve fitting, yielding a modified empirical correlation in the form of beta(max) = 0.8We(0.25).",,,,"Brian, Dominikus/X-3248-2018","Brian, Dominikus/0000-0001-6165-0355; Eslamian, Morteza/0000-0002-8096-1447",,,,,,,,,,,,0894-1777,1879-2286,,,,JUL,2019,105,,,,,,181,190,,10.1016/j.expthermflusci.2019.03.021,,,,,,,,WOS:000468721000017,,,,,

In addition, the conductive atomic force microscopy spectroscopy verified that the surface current of the perovskite-MoOx is larger than that of the pure perovskite film. The relationship between capacitance and frequency was tested and indirectly proved that bulk heterojunctions can rapidly separate the carriers. The ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy measurements provided a reasonable explanation for the MoOx-induced rapidly separating of the carriers.

A little moisture, harsh ultraviolet-light, and slightly higher thermal stress demolish it quickly into its constituents. A solution to these instability issues is a prerequisite to commercialize this next-generation solar-cell technology. To understand the degradation mechanism in perovskites, different models have been proposed. Similarly, to prevent them from environmental hazards, various strategies have been adopted. For instance, 2D-perovskites are introduced as a stable alternative to their 3D-counterparts. However, due to their wider bandgaps, 2D-perovskites failed to compete with 3D-perovskites in the race of power conversion efficiency. Therefore, a hybrid 2D/3D-perovskites are introduced which brought together, the high power conversion efficiency of 3D-perovskites and extended environmental stability of their 2D counterparts. The first section of this review discusses in detail about the proposed mechanisms behind the perovskites decompositions due to environmental factors including; humidity, radiation, and thermal stress.

The substrates where the perovskite film covered are expected to direct the growth of perovskite crystal and possess suitable energy level to accept the photoelecctrons effectively. Here we firstly modify the substrate via interface engineering by using W72V30-polyethyleneimine (PEI) multifunctional interlayer. With the incorporation of W72V30, the optimized morphology perovskite films are formed by controlling the crystallization kinetics of perovskite with fewer trap states. Simultaneously, the transfer of photoelectrons become more efficient due to the better energy level alignment between W72V30 and perovskite. Besides, rich animo group of the exposed PEI provide the interlayer with wetting property, resulting in a better interfacial contact between substrate and perovskite films. As a result, the photodetectors possess high-quality perovskite film and fewer electron recombinations at the surfaces and interfaces. The photodetectors reveal that the photocurrent increase from 4.5 mu A to 9.1 mu A, the on/off ratio is 3.99 x 10(3) and the photoresponsivity is 6.02 mA W-1 under simulated AM 1.5 illumination.

The paper deals with the comparison of the proposed design performance with the Lambertian values, bare cell and reference planar HIL free structure of same active layer thickness. The study predicts that the optical performance of the proposed structure based on periodic nanostructures greatly surpasses that of reference structure. There is a comparative enhancement of around 44% in the proposed design as compared to planar reference structure.

Both optical and electrical transient methods have previously been employed to strive for this warranted goal. However, electrical techniques can be strongly influenced by the capacitive response of the device which hides the carrier recombination dynamics that are relevant under steady state conditions. To ascertain the identification of steady state relevant charge carrier dynamics, it is beneficial to evaluate thicker films to minimize the impact of device capacitance. Herein, the electrical transient response in very efficient planar co-evaporated n-i-p solar cells is studied by varying the active layer thickness from 500 nm to 820 nm and is compared to a solution-processed perovskite device with an active layer of 350 nm thickness. In the case of the n-i-p devices, the capacitance of the 500 nm solar cell leads to longer perceived decay times in the lower voltage regime, while in the higher voltage regime quite similar kinetics independent of the active layer thickness are observed, allowing us to identify the transition from capacitance-affected to the sought-after bulk charge carrier dynamics. We show that increasing the perovskite thickness by more than 50% does not affect the recombination dynamics significantly, confirming the high quality of the vacuum-processed perovskite solar cells. Finally, it is demonstrated for the first time for perovskite solar cells that the recombination order in both thicker devices ranges between 1.6 and 2, pointing towards trap-assisted and free-carrier recombination under operating conditions.

Herein, we report two novel indolo[3,2-b]carbazole (ICZ) based small molecules obtained via a three-step reaction in a high yield without using expensive catalysts, namely C201 and C202, and further apply them as dopant-free HTMs in PSCs. Compared with C201, C202 contains two additional biphenylamino groups to improve its spatial configuration. It is found that the interplay between the molecular geometry and the aggregation behavior can exert a great influence on the film formation property and thus on the device performance. Strikingly, the champion devices employing C202 as the HTM deliver a much higher PCE of up to 17.7%, which is substantially higher than that of devices containing C201 (8.7%) under 100 mW cm(-2) illumination (AM 1.5G). It is revealed that the C202 capping layer exhibits a more homogeneous and uniform surface morphology as compared to that of C201, which effectively reduces the charge recombination losses and facilitates charge extraction, leading to a much-enhanced photovoltaic performance. This is the first example of ICZ core-based small molecules as dopant-free HTMs in PSCs. Moreover, the PSCs containing C202 as the HTM also exhibited good long-term stability under ambient conditions (40% RH) as compared to devices with doped spiro-OMeTAD, due largely to the hydrophobic nature of C202 which prevented moisture from destroying the perovskite film.

We have tested and utilized the HOMO-LUMO energy gap factor (beta) on 403 ABX(3) combinations. The factor beta successfully predicts and differentiate the perovskite and non-perovskite materials. Further, we also observed that for the formation of HOIPs structure, volume of the organic cation should also be in the range of 20 to 46 cm(3)/mol.

While surface passivation techniques have somewhat mitigated this instability, investigations as to whether all metal halide perovskites exhibit this instability with ZnO are yet to be undertaken. Experimental methods to elucidate the degradation mechanisms at ZnO-MAPbI(3) interfaces are developed. By substituting MA with formamidinium (FA) and cesium (Cs), the stability of the perovskite-ZnO interface is greatly enhanced and it is found that stability compares favorably with SnO2-based devices after high-intensity UV irradiation and 85 degrees C thermal stressing.

However, there are issues to be addressed in the design of PV ST-SCs, such as the stability of small grain crystals forming in thin films and reducing the number of layers in the device to increase AVT. We report herein that doping PV with a 0.03 wt % hybrid organic p-type semiconductor, fluorinated tetraarylbenzo [1,2-b:4,5-b'] dipyrrol-1,5-yl alkanediylsulfonate salt (BDPSO), affords a device with a 280 nm active layer directly fabricated on an indium tin oxide/glass substrate, without fabricating a hole transporting layer. Such a device exhibited a 30% higher PCE of 16.9% than the device made without doping. This device exhibited a stable photocurrent output at the maximum power point (MPP) for >1000 s under air and an operational stability of retaining 93% of the initial PCE after 1000 h continuous light soaking at the MPP. The ST-SC devices made of BDPSO-doped 140 nm and 90 nm thick PV films and a 6 nm thick Au electrode achieved PCEs of 10.3 and 8.0% and whole device semitransparency values of 22 and 30% AVT, respectively. The origins of the observed doping effect of BDPSO are ascribed to the bissulfonate structure that can effectively passivate defects at the interface and grain boundaries and to the HOMO level matching with PV to facilitate charge transfer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1944-8244,1944-8252,,,,26-Jun,2019,11,25,,,,,22603,22611,,10.1021/acsami.9b06513,,,,,,,,WOS:000473251100059,31144797,,,,

However, the quality of the film is degraded owing to the addition of additives. Holes and defects can be observed, and the dispersion of the additives are uneven inside. Here, a copper coordination polymer, Cu-bix, with matching energy level and fluorescent properties was screened for use as an additional additive to dope Spiro-OMeTAD. The doping of Cu-bix effectively improved the dispersion state of the additives in the hole transport layers and alleviated the aggregation of LiTFSI (lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide) or/and lithium salt complexes in the film. Owing to better dispersion of the additives, Spiro-OMeTAD was more fully and uniformly oxidized whereas the possibility of charge recombination was reduced in the devices. Furthermore, the flat and tightly bonded film layer obtained by optimization of the doping amount can efficiently transfer holes from the perovskite layers to the hole transport layers. Possible interaction mechanisms between additives and the copper coordination polymer are proposed and discussed. The resulting power conversion efficiency (PCE) for Cu-bix-doped PSCs was improved from 16.52 % to 18.47 % compared to the pristine devices, and this type of PSCs also showed a long stability in air owing to the increased hydrophobicity of the Cu-bix-based hole transport layers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1864-5631,1864-564X,,,,21-Jun,2019,12,12,,,,,2763,2772,,10.1002/cssc.201900509,,,,,,,,WOS:000478761200034,31168943,,,,

The number of extracted photogenerated carriers per square centimeter is increased by almost 11 times, from 1.34 mC cm(-2) for pure CuSCN to 14.69 mC cm(-2) for CuSCN/Cu2O at 0 s decay time. Finally, in situ growth of CuSCN/Cu2O successfully achieves a high charge transport rate and low charge recombination compared with pure CuSCN. The superior performance for in situ growth of CuSCN/Cu2O bilayered films will open new opportunities for a broad range of applications, including photoelectrochemical water splitting, dye-sensitized solar cells, and perovskite solar cells.",,,,,"Liang, Junhui/0000-0002-0508-8297",,,,,,,,,,,,2050-7526,2050-7534,,,,21-Jun,2019,7,23,,,,,6872,6878,,10.1039/c9tc02147g,,,,,,,,WOS:000471714400004,,,,,

Among them, phenyl-C-x-butyric acid methyl ester (PCxBM; x = 61 or 71) is the most frequently used because of its high solubility and solution processability. However, chemical modification of the original fullerenes (C-60 or C-70) will decrease the charge mobility, which is detrimental to the performance of PSCs. Moreover, the high cost of fullerene derivatives (such as PCBMs) is an obstacle hindering the commercialization of PSCs. In this study, we developed a pristine fullerene mixture (FM) composed of C-60 and C-70 as an electron-transport layer (ETL). Because of the increased configurational entropy, the solubility of the C-60 and C-70 mixture was significantly improved to 52.9 g L-1 (in dichlorobenzene), which may reduce the speed of crystallization of the FM during the spin-coating process, in which the organic solvent is evaporated. With this FM-based ETL, the PSCs exhibited an average power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.9%, which was higher than that (15.2%) of PC61BM-based ones. Additionally, the FM-based ETL exhibited greater hydrophobicity than PC61BM, which led to better moisture tolerance. As a result, the long-term stability of the FM-based PSCs was improved significantly, with reduced PCE degradation (from 26% to 15%) after 150 h under ambient conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2050-7526,2050-7534,,,,21-Jun,2019,7,23,,,,,6956,6963,,10.1039/c9tc01741k,,,,,,,,WOS:000471714400012,,,,,

Why and how perovskites break down under light irradiation and what happens at the atomistic level of these materials during the degradation process still remain unanswered. In this paper, we found the culprit and verified the mechanism for the irreversible degradation of hybrid perovskite materials from our experimental investigation and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation. We initially found that the electrostatic charges generated by light irradiation and trapped along the grain boundaries of the perovskite crystal result in oxygen-induced irreversible degradation in dry air. This result, together with our previous experimental finding on the same critical role of trapped charges in the perovskite degradation under moisture, suggests that the trapped charges are the main culprit in both the oxygen- and moisture-induced degradation of perovskite materials. Detailed roles of oxygen and water molecules were investigated using AIMD simulation by tracking the atomic motions in the outermost layers of the oxygen- or water-covered methylammonium lead triiodide (denoted MAPbI(3) for CH3NH3PbI3) perovskite crystal with trapped charges. In the first few picoseconds of our simulation, trapped charges start disrupting the crystal structure, leading to a short-range interaction between oxygen or water molecules and the compositional ions of MAPbI(3). We found that there exist different degradation pathways depending on both the polarity of the trapped charge and the kind of gas molecule. We also verified that a more structurally stable, multi-component perovskite material (with the composition of MA(0.6)FA(0.4)PbI(2.9)Br(0.1)) showed much stronger resistance against light-induced degradation than MAPbI(3) even in 100%-oxygen ambience or humid air.",,,,,"Heo, Jiyoung/0000-0001-9953-6400; Kim, Seong Keun/0000-0001-9891-0931",,,,,,,,,,,,2040-3364,2040-3372,,,,21-Jun,2019,11,23,,,,,11369,11378,,10.1039/c9nr02193k,,,,,,,,WOS:000471722100034,31166352,,,,

Electron injection layer is an important component of perovskite light-emitting device, which determines the growth of perovskite film directly. In this paper, the perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) based on n-type nanocrystalline silicon oxide (n-nc-SiOx:H) electron injection layer are designed and realized. This novel electron injecting material is prepared by the plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), and its smooth surface and matched energy band result in superior perovskite crystallinity and low electron injection barrier from the electron injecting layer to the emissive layer, respectively. However, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of PeLED is as low as 0.43%, which relates to defects and leakage current due to the incomplete surface coverage of perovskite film. The fast exciton emission decay (< 10 ns) stems from strong non-radiative energy transfer to the trap states, and represents a big challenge in fabricating high-efficiency PeLEDs. In order to obtain desirable perovskite film morphology, an excessive proportion of methylammonium bromide (MABr) is incorporated into the perovskite solution, and a volume of benzylamine (PMA) is added into the chlorobenzene antisolvent. The perovskite films suffer low PLQY and short PL lifetime if only MABr or PMA is introduced. When the molar ratio of MABr is higher than 60%, the luminescence quenching arising from Joule heating is depressed by employing PMA, contributing to a higher PLQY (> 30%) and a longer carrier lifetime. The synergistic effect of MABr and PMA increase the coverage and reduce the trap density of perovskite film, inhibit the luminescence quenching in the annealing process, and thus facilitating the perovskite film with higher quality. Finally, the n-i-p PeLED exhibits green-light emission with a maximum current efficiency of 7.93 cd.A(-1) and a maximum EQE up to 2.13% is obtained. These facts provide a novel electron injecting material and a feasible process for implementing the PeLEDs. With further optimizing the perovskite layer and device configuration, the performance of n-i-p type PeLEDs will be improved significantly on the basis of this electron injection material.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1000-3290,,,,,20-Jun,2019,68,12,,,,,,,128103,10.7498/aps.68.20190258,,,,,,,,WOS:000472505500028,,,,,

In conventional perovskite solar cells, the presence of a UV-active oxygen vacancy in compact TiO2 prohibits current generation by heavily trapping electrons after UV degradation. Conversely, the dominant vacancy type in the 2D Ti1-delta O2 ASTL is a titanium vacancy, which is a shallow acceptor and is not UV-sensitive. Therefore, it significantly suppresses carrier recombination and extends UV stability in perovskite solar cells with a 2D Ti1-delta O2 ASTL. Other carrier dynamics, such as electron diffusion, electron injection, and hot hole transfer processes, were found to be less affected by UV irradiation.

Here, we map the contact potential difference and photocurrent distribution of MAPbI(3) at different temperatures in situ by Kelvin probe force microscopy and conductive atomic force microscopy, emphasizing the different influences of variable temperature and phase transition on the photoelectric properties of grains and grain boundaries (GBs). It is discovered that both the Fermi level and photocurrent decrease as the sample is heated from 30 to 80 degrees C gradually because of the variation of effective carrier concentration and the degradation of carrier mobility implicated by lattice vibration scattering. The difference between the Fermi level at GBs and that on the grains ascends first and then descends, peaking at 50 degrees C, near which MAPbI(3) transforms from a tetragonal phase to a cubic phase. This peak is speculated as a comprehensive consequence of the increasing difference of the Fermi level of semiconductors with different doping concentrations and the converging properties of grains and GBs with the temperature rising because the lower ion activation energy of the cubic phase at higher temperatures facilitates greatly the ions' movement between grains and GB. The variation trend of the difference of the photocurrent is the same.

The double HEL film is fabricated by thermal evaporation of MoO3 and spin-coating of poly(3,4-ethylene dioxy-thiophene)-poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). The double EEL is formed by spin-coating of phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM) and bathocuproine (BCP). We investigate the effect of each additional second HEL and/or EEL interlayer on the photovoltaic parameters of the perovskite solar cells. We observed that the underneath MoO3 layer provides an improved morphology for perovskite film and reduces the shunt path. However, the BCP buffer interlayer passivates the defects at the perovskite-EEL interface and helps to planarize the thin-films for better contact with Ag. Thus, double EEL and HEL facilitate better charge collection at the interfaces and shows improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of similar to 15%. Besides the improved PCE, double EEL and HEL based structures also provide an approach to have better reproducibility and high thermal stability of perovskite solar cells. We also address the issue of area dependent efficiency and explore the reasons behind the increased efficiency of smaller area devices. We believe reproducibility, stability and area dependence are the most important aspects for current perovskite PV research and thus this study will provide an important insight for further development.

This work reports an efficient ETM, named PDI-C-60, by the combination of perylene diimide (PDI) and fullerene. Compared to the traditional PCBM, this strategy endows PDI-C-60 with slightly shallower energy level and higher electron mobility. As a result, the device based on PDI-C-60 as electron transport layer (ETL) achieves high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.6%, which is significantly higher than those of the control devices of PCBM (16.6%) and PDI (13.8%). The high PCE of the PDI-C-60-based device can be attributed to the more matching energy level with the perovskite, more efficient charge extraction, transport, and reduced recombination rate. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 18.6% is the highest value in the PSCs using PDI derivatives as ETLs.

They also improved device performance and stability. For this purpose, cellulose nanofibers (CNF), TEMPO-oxidized CNF (TOCNF), bacterial cellulose (BC), and chitin nanofibers (ChNF) were investigated. The proposed materials and protocols for incorporating the electrolyte, via simple casting, avoided the typical problems associated with injection of the electrolyte through filling holes, a major difficulty especially in manufacturing large area cells. Owing to the fact that cryogel membranes did not require any orifice for injection, they were effective in minimizing leakage and in retaining liquid electrolyte. The results indicated the reduction of performance losses compared to conventional electrolyte filling, likely due to the better spatial distribution of electrolyte. DSCs based on BC cryogels had an initially higher performance and similar stability compared to those of the reference cells. When compared to reference cells, CNF and ChNF cryogels produced higher initial performance, but they underwent a faster degradation. The difference in stability was attributed to the effect of residual components, including lignin in CNF and proteins in ChNF, as demonstrated in bleaching experiments. TOCNF indicated a relatively poor performance, most likely because of residual aldehydes. Overall, we offer a comprehensive evaluation based on current-voltage (IV) profiles under simulated sunlight, incident photon-to-charge carrier efficiency (IPCE), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and color image processing, together with accelerated DSC stability tests, to unveil the effects of new membrane-based assembly.

They showed instability, however, under 1 sun illumination at similar to 30 degrees C. Here, we demonstrate that the combination of the NiOx HTL and the ITO for both top and bottom electrodes of the perovskite solar cells can solve this instability problem. This approach resulted in highly stable semitransparent devices with the average visible light transmittance (AVT) above 11% and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.5%, showing steady power output nearly 4000 h of continuous operation at MPPT under 1 sun illumination. While the use of poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl) (PTAA) HTL resulted in the semitransparent devices with higher PCE of 13.6%, their device stabilities were much inferior to the NiOx HTL based devices. These results indicated that a rather classical MA based perovskite, MAPbI(3), is indeed a stable photovoltaic material with the proper choice of the interface layers and electrode materials, and the use of the sputter-deposited NiOx HTL together with the ITO back contact is one of the key elements to overcome the stability problem in the lead halide perovskite solar cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0927-0248,1879-3398,,,,15-Jun,2019,195,,,,,,323,329,,10.1016/j.solmat.2019.03.004,,,,,,,,WOS:000466454600039,,,,,

However, the interfacial contact between perovskite film and TNRAs is one of the main factors that restricts the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of TNRAs based PSCs at present. In this paper, by employing a two-step spin-coating method, the influence of PbI2 solvent such as PbI2/DMSO + ACN and PbI2/DMSO + DMF + HAc solutions, on the preparation and performance of TNRAs based PSCs was intensively investigated. More importantly, the relationship between the micro-characteristics of perovskite film, especially the interfacial contact between perovskite film and TNRAs, and macro-properties of PSCs was elucidated. Experimental results indicate that two compact perovskite films with similar large grain size were synthesized on TNRAs from the two different PbI2 solvents, which leads to similar short circuit current densities (J(sc)). However, the PSC from PbI2/DMSO + DMF + HAc solution shows a larger V-oc of 1.10 V compared with that from PbI2/DMSO + ACN solution, and thus a higher PCE of 16.57% was achieved under natural ambient conditions.

Moreover, BaCoF4 exhibits both an antiferromagnetic spin structure and ferroelectric polarization along the (001) direction. These combined electronic and optical features render BaCoF4 a promising bifunctional material for application in spintronic or photovoltaic devices. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the dominant point defects in BaCoF4 are mostly shallow-level donor defects, leading to fascinating n-type self-doping. As such, a BaCoF4 layer may be exploited for electron transport and light absorption altogether, which may enhance the photovoltaic performance in solar cells.

Compared with the fresh CsPbBr3 NCs, a better color purity and a higher photoluminescence quantum yield were achieved, accompanied with a gradual blue shift of the emission peak with an increasing Na+ doping ratio. On the one hand, the passivation effect with Na+ doping substantially reduces the nonradiative trap centers in NCs. On the other hand, the density functional theory calculations indicate that the doping of Na+ ions forms the energetically preferred substitution Na-Pb, which increases the optical band gap of CsPbBr3 and the diffusion barrier of Br vacancy in CsPbBr3 structures. Experimentally, the as-synthesized Na+-doped CsPbBr3 NCs present obvious enhancements in stability against ultraviolet light, heat, and moisture. The above advantages allow us to use such CsPbBr3:Na NCs as solid-state phosphors for white light-emitting device (WLED) applications.

In this report, the impacts of substituted Cs+ cations on the inherent properties such as microstructures, morphology, and photophysics of pure methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) perovskites have been investigated. Successful formation of mixed MA1-xCsxPbBr3 phases (with 0 = x = 1.0) was predicted from the theoretically calculated tolerance factor, which was further supported by the appearance of sharp diffraction peaks in X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns without any additional peaks in the whole composition range. Substitution of Cs+ ions brings significant lattice contraction in the parent MAPbBr3 crystal due to the ion size disparity in the ionic radii between MA+ and Cs+ ions. We examine the vibrational signatures of the Raman bands related to the organic MA+ and infer the nature of interactions between the organic moiety and the surrounding inorganic cage as a function of Cs concentration. Raman spectroscopic analysis reveals structural distortion due to the altered H-bonding interaction of the N+-H. Br-type between MA+ and the PbBr3 -octahedral framework as a function of Cs content, which is responsible for the octahedral tilting in Cs substituted MAPbBr3. We also found hindered rotational motions of MA+ in the octahedral cage of mixed cationic systems, resulting in the orientational ordering of MA in the presence of Cs. These results certainly offer highly ordered mixed phase structures and promote superior thermal stability, as evident from the thermogravimetric analysis. The photoluminescence intensity becomes considerably enhanced at increased substitution levels, which highlights the capability of incorporated Cs+ cations in suppressing non-radiative recombination in a pure MA-based crystal, possibly related to the mitigation of trapping.

Here, we have used phase-modulated two-photon photoluminescence microspectroscopy to separately quantify the emissions from excitons and free charges in a MAPbBr(3) crystal. Our results show that while most of the emission at room temperature is from the recombination of free charges, there are also localized spots where the emissions from excitons dominate. By analyzing the enhancement of the emissions at low temperatures, we show that the trap-mediated nonradiative recombinations are suppressed by local deformations in the band structure.

Inorganic caesium lead halide perovskites have a bandgap well suited to tandem solar cells(1) but suffer from an undesired phase transition near room temperature(2). Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are structurally robust materials prized for their size-tunable bandgap(3); however, they also require further advances in stability because they are prone to aggregation and surface oxidization at high temperatures as a consequence of incomplete surface passivation(4,5). Here we report 'lattice-anchored' hybrid materials that combine caesium lead halide perovskites with lead chalcogenide CQDs, in which lattice matching between the two materials contributes to a stability exceeding that of the constituents. We find that CQDs keep the perovskite in its desired cubic phase, suppressing the transition to the undesired lattice-mismatched phases. The stability of the CQD-anchored perovskite in air is enhanced by an order of magnitude compared with pristine perovskite, and the material remains stable for more than six months at ambient conditions (25 degrees Celsius and about 30 per cent humidity) and more than five hours at 200 degrees Celsius. The perovskite prevents oxidation of the CQD surfaces and reduces the agglomeration of the nanoparticles at 100 degrees Celsius by a factor of five compared with CQD controls. The matrix-protected CQDs show a photoluminescence quantum efficiency of 30 per cent for a CQD solid emitting at infrared wavelengths.

The high performance of the devices was ascribed to the combination of the higher carrier mobility of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as a channel and the volumetric nature of the OECTs' response, and the charge density of the volumetric channel was efficiently modulated by incident light compared to FETs. Moreover, OECT-based OPTs with quantum dots (CdSe/ZnS) as a light sensitizer were characterized under ultraviolet light, and they exhibited excellent photosensitivity, which further verified the superiority of OECT for phototransistors. Furthermore, a flexible image sensor was fabricated for the first time by integrating flexible OECTs-OPTs into a 10 X 10 array, which can clearly identify the target image under a bending state, indicating the great potential of OECTs-OPTs in the application of low-power, ultrasensitive flexible photodetectors and imaging technology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1944-8244,1944-8252,,,,5-Jun,2019,11,22,,,,,20214,20224,,10.1021/acsami.9b04486,,,,,,,,WOS:000470938500061,31074275,,,,

As the density of the memory devices continues to increase, the size of the devices approaches that of the individual grains of the polycrystalline films. Thus, the effects of the grain boundary and the grain size will become important to investigate the influence on the switching behaviors. Here, we report the effects of grain sizes on the resistive switching property of (C4H9NH3)(2)PbBr4 (BA(2)PbBr(4)) films. The BA(2)PbBr(4) films were formed by using sequential vapor deposition. First, a lead bromide (PbBr2) film was deposited by thermal evaporation, and then the film was exposed to organic vapor to form BA(2)PbBr(4) films. The grain sizes were controlled by changing the transformation temperatures (T-T = 100, 150, and 200 degrees C). When the TT values were 100, 150, and 200 degrees C, the grain sizes of BA(2)PbBr(4) were similar to 180 nm, similar to 1, and similar to 30 mu m, respectively. In the memory device based on BA(2)PbBr(4), the off current decreased from similar to 10(-4) to similar to 10(-8) A as the grain size increased from similar to 180 nm to similar to 30 mu m. This method to synthesize BA(2)PbBr(4) films provides a simple way to control the grain sizes, and understanding of the effects of grain sizes on memory characteristics will provide an insight to improve the reliability of the OIHP-based memory as the electronic devices are scaled down to the sizes of grains.",,,,"Lee, Jang-Sik/A-6629-2008","Lee, Jang-Sik/0000-0002-1096-1783",,,,,,,,,,,,1944-8244,1944-8252,,,,5-Jun,2019,11,22,,,,,20225,20231,,10.1021/acsami.9b05038,,,,,,,,WOS:000470938500062,31117475,,,,

Encouragingly, a gradient energy band is created at the interface with an outstanding hole blocking effect. As a result, both the charge recombination occurring at the interface and the nonradiative recombination inside the perovskite are suppressed, and, simultaneously, the charge extraction is improved successfully. Therefore, the power conversion efficiency of the CsPbIBr2 PSCs is increased to as high as 10.88% under one sun illumination, which is 30% higher than its counterparts without the modification.

To enhance the performance of DSSCs, the basic structure of an electron donor, pi-electron linker, and electron acceptor, i.e., D-pi-A, is suggested. In addition, special organic dyes containing coumarin, carbazole, and triphenylamine electron donor groups are synthesized to find an effective dye structure that avoids charge recombination at electrode surfaces. Meanwhile, PSCs are manufactured using both a coating method and a laser deposition technique. The results of interfacial studies demonstrate that the level of the conduction band edge (CBE) of a compact TiO2 layer is shifted after TiCl4 treatment, which strongly affects the solar cell performance.

To reduce such losses and maximize light coupling, the broadband transparency of such electrodes should be improved, especially at the front of the device. Here, the excellent properties of Zr-doped indium oxide (IZRO) transparent electrodes for such applications, with improved near-infrared (NIR) response, compared to conventional tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) electrodes, are shown. Optimized IZRO films feature a very high electron mobility (up to approximate to 77 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)), enabling highly infrared transparent films with a very low sheet resistance (approximate to 18 omega (-1) for annealed 100 nm films). For devices, this translates in a parasitic absorption of only approximate to 5% for IZRO within the solar spectrum (250-2500 nm range), to be compared with approximate to 10% for commercial ITO. Fundamentally, it is found that the high conductivity of annealed IZRO films is directly linked to promoted crystallinity of the indium oxide (In2O3) films due to Zr-doping. Overall, on a four-terminal perovskite/silicon tandem device level, an absolute 3.5 mA cm(-2) short-circuit current improvement in silicon bottom cells is obtained by replacing commercial ITO electrodes with IZRO, resulting in improving the PCE from 23.3% to 26.2%.",,,,"; Morales-Masis, Monica/M-9805-2018","Hedhili, Mohamed Nejib/0000-0002-3624-036X; Morales-Masis, Monica/0000-0003-0390-6839",,,,,,,,,,,,1616-301X,1616-3028,,,,JUN,2019,29,25,,,,,,,1901741,10.1002/adfm.201901741,,,,,,,,WOS:000472552900002,,,,,

It is observed that both larger and more hydrophobic cations can improve perovskite stability against moisture, while larger size can adversely influence the device performance. Interestingly, with F-PEA or MeO-PEA, distribution of n value can be shifted toward high 3D content in quasi-2D perovskite layers, which enables lower bandgaps and possibly lower exciton binding energy.

The correlation between photoluminescence, photocurrent, electroluminescence, and Raman maps gives a detailed understanding of the different infiltration mechanisms, electronic contact at interfaces, and effect on local photocurrent for the cells.

Based on this, significant progress has been made on transferring material engineering strategies to processes capable of scale-up, such as blade coating, spray coating, inkjet printing, screen printing, relief printing, and gravure printing. Here, an overview is provided of the strategies that led to devices deposited by these scalable techniques with PCEs as high as 21%.

High efficiency, pollution-free and low cost have always been the goals pursued in the solar cell field. However, traditional perovskite solar cells have a greater impact on the environment due to the heavy metal element lead in their light absorbing materials, which limits the further commercial application of such perovskite solar cells. Based on this consideration, many scientists are working hard to find novel lead-free perovskite materials. Among numerous lead-free perovskite materials, Sn-based perovskite materials have become the most promising alternatives due to their relatively low toxicity, suitable band gap, and high power conversion efficiency of corresponding devices. Sn-based perovskite solar cells also have some weak points, however. Their energy conversion efficiency and the device stability are much lower compared with Pb-based perovskite solar cells. The device is very sensitive to air during the preparation process. In order to solve these problems, it is imperative to study the factors affecting the performances of Sn-based perovskite materials and devices. The paper introduces various kinds of Sn-based perovskite materials and their application in perovskite solar cells, including organic-inorganic hybrid Sn-based perovskite materials, mixed Sn-Pb perovskite materials and all-inorganic Sn-based perovskite materials.

Anodic breakdown (at ca. 0.5 V) causes restructuring into submicrometer particles and denuding of the substrate. The natural p-doping is demonstrated by both the Hall effect and Mott-Schottky plots from electrochemical impedance. The corresponding flatband potentials (in V vs Ag/AgCl) varied with the substrate type as follows: 0.12 V (CuSCN@FTO), 0.08 V (CuSCN@Au), -0.02 V (CuSCN@GC), and 0.00 V (CuSCN@rGO).

We find that their electronic properties depend strongly on the mixed atoms (Cs, Rb, Ge and Pb) and the formation energy is related to the HOIP's composition, where the atoms are more easily mixed in SnI-2D-HOIPs due to low formation energy at the same composition ratio. We further show that optimal solar energy harvesting can be achieved on the solar cells composed of mixed SnI-2D-HOIPs because of reduced bandgaps, enhanced mobility and improved stability. Importantly, we find that the mixed atoms (Cs, Rb, Ge and Pb) with the appropriate composition ratios can effectively enhance the solar-to-power efficiency and show greatly improved resistance to moisture.

In the best case, the protection layer would also serve as the heterojunction partner, minimizing complexity and thereby cost. However, the bands of most high performance semiconductors are poorly aligned with TiO2, limiting the photovoltage. Here, we describe a method to overcome this limitation through the placement of a tunable dipole layer at the interface of the p- and n- type materials, shifting the relative band positions to enable an increased photovoltage. The introduction of a phosphonic acid (PA, H3PO3) layer increases the photovoltage of TiO2-protected Si, Sb2Se3, and Cu2O photocathodes. The dipole effect scales with PA surface coverage, and gives even larger shifts when multilayers are employed.

Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals a quasi-equilibrium distribution of hot carriers forming upon excess-energy excitation of the perovskite-a distribution largely unaffected by the presence of TiO2. In contrast, the quasi-equilibrium distribution of hot carriers is virtually nonexistent when spiro-OMeTAD is present, which is indicative of efficient hot hole extraction at the interface of MAPbI(3). Density functional theory calculations predict that deep energy-levels of MAPbI(3) exhibit electronically delocalized character, with significant overlap with the localized valence band charge of the spiro-OMeTAD molecules lying on the surface of MAPbI(3). Consequently, hot holes are easily extracted from the deep energy-levels of MAPbI(3) by spiro-OMeTAD.

The device modeling of PSCs is based on the device structure of FTO/TiO2/MAPbI(3)/CuSCN/Au. Two interface defect layers, IDL1 as electron transport material (ETM)/absorber interface and IDL2 as absorber/HTM interface, are introduced into the device model in order to study the impact of interface quality on the performance of PSCs. Among all of the parameters, defect density and conduction band offset (CBO) at ETM/ absorber interface together with the defect density of absorber influence the device performance appreciably. Upon optimization of all of the parameters, PCE of the device approaches to 25.02%, which is very encouraging.

The stability of perovskite solar cells is currently one of the major challenges for perovskite/silicon tandem devices and is improving rapidly. However, different degradation rates of perovskite cells and silicon cells in a tandem solar module can affect the overall module degradation. The lifetime energy yield and economic viability of perovskite/ silicon tandem modules strongly depend on the degradation rates of perovskite cells. In this paper we present a simulation study of the long term power and energy yield of perovskite/silicon tandem modules under different perovskite cell degradation scenarios. We also estimate the efficiency and cost requirements for the economic feasibility of two-and four-terminal tandem modules. We determine that to maintain 80% of the initial power in a tandem module after 25 years, the maximum permissible perovskite top cell degradation rates are 0.9% per year in a two-terminal configuration and 1.3% per year in a four-terminal configuration for a realistic perovskite cell degradation scenario. We project that a future perovskite/silicon tandem module can produce over 10% more lifetime energy than a single-junction silicon module in 2025 assuming a tandem cell efficiency reaches of 28% and a modest perovskite cell degradation rate of 2% per year. Finally, we estimate the levelized cost of energy for both two-and four-terminal tandem modules. In the case of a degradation rate of 2% per year of the perovskite cell and 50% additional cost for the tandem structure compared to single-junction modules, we find that power conversion efficiencies of 28.7% and 27.6% enable the economic viability of two-and four-terminal perovskite/silicon tandem modules.

The facile formation of tin vacancies and oxidation of the divalent tin cation during the thin film fabrication process are among the causes of these problems, because the tin perovskite layer then becomes p-doped, resulting in significant trap-assisted recombination losses in devices. In this paper, we demonstrate that increasing the crystallinity of the tin perovskite film is an effective way to address the open issues with Sn-based perovskites. We succeed in improving the crystallinity of the 3D formamidinium tin iodide (FASnI(3)) grains, increasing their size, and perfecting their orientation in the out-of-plane direction by incorporating ethylammonium iodide (EAI) into a 2D/3D tin perovskite film (where 2D is PEA(2)FASn(2)I(7), PEA = phenylethylammonium). This leads to a decrease of traps and background charge carrier density, and therefore to decreased charge recombination losses in EA(x)2D/3D based devices, as compared not only to devices based on FASnI(3) but also to those based on 2D/3D mixtures. As a consequence, devices using a perovskite layer with composition EA(0.08)2D/3D exhibit much higher PCE (8.4%) and better reproducibility compared to devices based on mixed 2D/3D perovskites (7.7%) and 3D perovskite (4.7%).",,,,,"Duim, Herman/0000-0002-5126-0000",,,,,,,,,,,,2211-2855,2211-3282,,,,JUN,2019,60,,,,,,810,816,,10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.04.040,,,,,,,,WOS:000467774100090,,,,,

The PL intensity of the perovskite film deposited on TiO2/TiO2:AgInS2 QDs was quenched by the addition of AgInS2 QDs into TiO2. A rectification ratio (RR) of the planar PSCs was improved by using TiO2/TiO2:AgInS2 QDs as dual electron transport layers.

In this study, a facile and effective approach was developed to improve perovskite conversion rate and film quality via in situ solvent assisted crystallization (ISAC) and compositional adjustment.

Devices were pressed from chemically synthesized powders. Pressed perovskite powders were found to exhibit properties favorable for use in supercapacitors. Furthermore, physical properties of the pellets are controllable through the sintering process, allowing for broad device tunability. It is demonstrated that the electrical performance of characterized 1 mm pellets are temperature, frequency, and cell potential difference dependent. The device under study exhibited an energy density of 34.2 Wh/kg at 100 Hz at room temperature. The high performance of the device is attributed to perovskite's ability to operate at potential differences of up to 10V. A mean areal capacitance of 432 mF/cm(2) was recorded for a broad range of frequencies at 300K. A significant drop in performance is observed at operating frequencies above 10(5) Hz. This is caused by the operating frequency exceeding the lead-iodide stretching mode.

One of the major obstacles is that the hole transport materials developed for state-of-the-art Au-based PSCs are not suitable for carbon-based PSCs. Here, we develop a low-temperature, solution-processed Poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT)/graphene composite hole transport layer(HTL), that is compatible with paintable carbon-electrodes to produce state-of-the-art perovskitedevices. Space-charge-limited-current measurements reveal that the as-prepared P3HT/graphene composite exhibits outstanding charge mobility and thermal tolerance, with hole mobility increasing from 8.3 x 10(-3) cm(2)V(-1)s(-1) (as-deposited) to 1.2 x 10(-2)cm(2)V(-1)s(-1) (after annealing at 100 degrees C)-two orders of magnitude larger than pure P3HT. The improved charge transport and extraction provided by the composite HTL provides a significant efficiency improvement compared to cells with a pure P3HT HTL. As aresult, we report carbon-based solar cells with a record efficiency of 17.8% (certified by Newport); and the first perovskite cells to be certified under the stabilized testing protocol.

Large disparities between (I) the width of the Debye layers and that of the perovskite layer (similar to 600 nm) and (II) the ion vacancy density and the charge carrier densities motivate an asymptotic approach to solving the model, while the stiffness of the equations renders standard solution methods unreliable.

In addition, the applications of MHP solar cells are restricted by the instability of perovskite materials and devices. In this article, the most urgent stability problems faced by perovskite solar cells are identified, and recent progresses in MHPs are enumerated. The factors affecting the stability of perovskite materials and devices are also discussed.

In this study, we use an electrospray deposition technique to prepare perovskite films at room temperature, oriented in (002) and (110) directions, with (002) as the preferred orientation. The results of a detailed study on the emergence of the two orientations during perovskite formation are reported. The effect of process parameters, such as substrate temperature during deposition and annealing temperature, on the grain orientation was established using XRD and grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). The study suggests that an irreversible crystal reorientation from (002) to (110) occurs at high temperature during rapid annealing, whereas a reversible crystal thermal expansion is seen during slow annealing. Finally, the results of the grain reorientation are correlated with the film properties, and it is shown that the film with the dominant (110) orientation has improved morphology and optoelectronic properties.

However, it is difficult to achieve a high film quality for an NMP-processed perovskite film in a short time. In this communication, we developed a two-step green anti-solvent engineering technique to rapidly tune the morphology of the NMP-processed perovskite film. The first step was to deposit ethyl acetate (EA) on top of the precursor film to induce fast nucleation. Second, a methylammonium chloride (MACl) solution dissolved in isopropanol (IPA) was added to affect the crystal growth process and subsequently form a two-layer structured perovskite film including MAPbI(3) as a bottom layer and mixed MAPbI(3)/MAPbI(x)Cl(3-x) as an upper layer. The upper layer showed a significantly enhanced degree of crystallinity and reduced trap states. It has been recognized that MAPbI(x)Cl(3-x) has a higher LUMO level than that of MAPbI(3). Thus, the enrichment of a Cl-based perovskite near/at the surface can promote the efficient charge transfer. Furthermore, the limited content of MAPbI(x)Cl(3-x) in MAPbI(3) barely affects the entire absorption of the perovskite and thus the J(SC) of the device.

While impurities could create harmful trap states that lead to nonradiative recombination of charge carriers and adversely affect PV efficiency, they could also potentially increase absorption via midgap energy levels that act as stepping stones for subgap photons or introduce charge carriers via doping. To unearth trends in impurity energy states, we use first principles density functional theory calculations to extensively study partial substitution of Pb in methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr(3)), a representative lead-halide perovskite. Investigation of the density of states and energy levels related to the transition of the substitutional defect from one charge state to another reveals that several elements create midgap energy states in MAPbBr(3). We machine learned trends and design rules from the computational data and discovered that a few easily computed properties of the bromide compounds of any element can be used to predict the energetics and energy levels of the substitutional defect related to that element. The calculated Fermi level-dependent defect formation energies lead to the observation that substitution by transition metals, Zr, Hf, Nb, and Sc, and group V element Sb can shift the equilibrium Fermi level and change the perovskite conductivity, as determined by the dominant intrinsic point defects. Finally, metal-substituted MAPbBr(3) compounds of Bi, Sc, Ni, and Zr were experimentally investigated, and while there was an improvement in the thin-film morphology and an enhancement in charge carrier lifetimes, no clear evidence of subgap absorption features owing to the substituent being incorporated in the MAPbBr(3) lattice could be seen.",,,,"Kanakkithodi, Arun Kumar Mannodi/I-8528-2019; Park, Ji-Sang/F-9944-2010; Gosztola, David/V-3741-2019","Kanakkithodi, Arun Kumar Mannodi/0000-0003-0780-1583; Park, Ji-Sang/0000-0002-1374-8793; Gosztola, David/0000-0003-2674-1379; Martinson, Alex/0000-0003-3916-1672",,,,,,,,,,,,0897-4756,1520-5002,,,,28-May,2019,31,10,,,,,3599,3612,,10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b04017,,,,,,,,WOS:000470035000002,,,,,

To fabricate a continuous methylammonium lead tribromide (MAPbBr(3)) film, a hydrophilic polymer, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), was added to the MAPbBr(3) precursor solution. Due to the increased wettability of the precursor solution, a full surface coverage of MAPbBr(3)-PVP composite film without pinholes was produced. Moreover, zinc oxide (ZnO) quantum dot (QD) was synthesized by hydrothermal process in order to use as an electron transporting layer (ETL), and surface modification of QD was performed by oleic acid (OA) molecules in order to increase spatial distribution in the anti-solvent of perovskite. It was found that, due to the reduced agglomeration of QDs during a spin-coating process, a smooth and highly transparent OA-modified ZnO (OA-ZnO) QD layer was obtained. Thus, the PeLED prepared by using MAPbBr(3)-PVP composite film and OA-ZnO QD layer exhibited an excellent device performance of a maximum luminance of 11095.1 cd m(-2) at 6 V and a maximum current efficiency of 6.79 cd A(-1) at 4 V.

J,"Mesquita, I; Andrade, L; Mendes, A",,,,"Mesquita, Isabel; Andrade, Luisa; Mendes, Adelio",,,Temperature Impact on Perovskite Solar Cells Under Operation,CHEMSUSCHEM,,,,,,,,,,,,"Perovskite solar cells (PSC) have emerged as a promising substitute for conventional silicon panels, showing the fastest power conversion efficiency evolution within the photovoltaic field, going from 3.8% to 23.7% in a few years. However, PSC thermal stability is still an obstacle to their commercialization. In this study, the temperature effect on mesoporous triple-cation perovskite solar cells with two different hole extraction materials2,2,7,7-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) and poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA)is assessed. The cells are exposed to thermal stress between -5 degrees C and 80 degrees C and their photovoltaic performance is monitored in situ to reproduce real operating conditions. At low temperatures, the devices present very stable values (average loss <5%), but as the temperature increases significant decreases in the open circuit potential and short-circuit current are observed. X-ray diffraction shows no change in the perovskite crystal structure with temperature. However, electron scanning microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicate that temperature has a great impact on the hole extraction layer. The cell performance loss is attributed to the evaporation of additives added to the hole extraction layer to enhance its conductivity. Although the decrease in power conversion efficiency at 80 degrees C is slightly higher for PTAA cells, spiro-OMeTAD cells present a higher irreversible loss of (21.6 +/- 2.3)% after thermal stress tests, whereas PTAA devices showed only a loss of (8.2 +/- 1.6)%.",,,,,"Mesquita, Isabel/0000-0002-0785-0476; Andrade Silva, Luisa Manuela Madureira/0000-0001-5750-1285",,,,,,,,,,,,1864-5631,1864-564X,,,,21-May,2019,12,10,,,,,2186,2194,,10.1002/cssc.201802899,,,,,,,,WOS:000472806800014,30802368,,,,

However, significant interfacial recombination of charge carriers in solar cells fabricated with this active layer, which is intrinsically associated with the unwanted conduction band misalignment between CsPbIBr2 and the commonly used TiO2 electron transport layer, has limited power conversion efficiency (PCE) values. Herein, we demonstrate successful conduction band alignment engineering at the TiO2/CsPbIBr2 heterojunction by modifying TiO2 with CsBr clusters. Such modification triggers a beneficial increase in the conduction band minimum (CBM) of TiO2 from -4.00 to -3.81eV and decreases the work function from 4.11 to 3.86eV, thus promoting favorable band alignment at the heterojunction, suppressing recombination, and improving extraction and transport of charge carriers. As a result, the carbon-based, all-inorganic CsPbIBr2 solar cells exhibit over 20% enhancement in average PCE. The champion device achieves a PCE of 10.71%, a record among pure CsPbIBr2-based cells, open-circuit voltage of 1.261V, and excellent stability.",,,,"Zhu, Weidong/H-2072-2018; Chang, Jingjing/N-9263-2013","Zhu, Weidong/0000-0002-3872-7323; Chang, Jingjing/0000-0003-3773-182X",,,,,,,,,,,,1864-5631,1864-564X,,,,21-May,2019,12,10,,,,,2318,2325,,10.1002/cssc.201900611,,,,,,,,WOS:000472806800029,30912615,,,,

The pyrrole ring is hydrophobic, and its nitrogen atom (N) can combine with the lead-iodine (Pb-I) framework by coordinating with Pb ions or pyrrole forms hydrogen bonds with organic cations. XRD patterns and AFM images prove that pyrrole significantly affects the crystallinity and roughness of perovskite films.

However, defects and a high moisture sensitivity limit the further development of perovskite device performance. This study shows that cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), a multifunctional ammonium salt, plays dual roles in passivating the perovskite defects and improving the moisture stability. Attaching a long carbon chain to the perovskite surface improves the humidity stability. The ammonium group in the CTA(+) cation can anchor to the surface of the MAPbI(3) film to passivate defects without the formation of a secondary phase, and Br- is uniformly distributed on the surface and has a gradient distribution in the vertical direction. Furthermore, by optimizing the CTAB solution concentration, the MAPbI(3) device with CTAB demonstrated an optimum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.95% with a steady-state output PCE of 18.11%. Finally, the MAPbI(3) device treated with CTAB exhibited better moisture resistance, with no obvious decline observed during the storage stability test for 1600 h under dry conditions in the dark.
