TiO2 is widely used as an ETL material due to its excellent transport properties, however, the presence of defects in the TiO2 layer diminishes the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices. Herein, we introduce a method of low-temperature TiCl4 treatment to deposit a TiOx layer on the surface of TiO2 film, which can effectively passivate trap states at the TiO2 surface. Moreover, the treating process is optimized to be 30 min using a 40mM TiCl4 aqueous solution. Benefiting from this, we obtain the champion device with the highest PCE of 18.47%, which is mainly due to the reduction of surface defects and the deposition of the well-crystallized perovskite films. Besides, the modified PSCs exhibit an average PCE of 17.59%, which is much better than the control devices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2010-135X,2010-1368,,,,APR,2018,8,2,,,,,,,UNSP 1850009,10.1142/S2010135X18500091,,,,,,,,WOS:000432041900004,,,,,

We report the outdoor stability measurements of two types of devices showing either reversible photo-degradation or reversible efficiency improvement under sunlight. Instead of the initial (or stabilized) efficiency and T-80 as the figures of merit for the performance and stability of such devices, we propose using the value of the energy output generated during the first day of exposure and the time needed to reach its 20% drop, respectively.

The solution processability of these materials is one of their major advantages on the route toward fabrication of low-cost solar cells and optoelectronic devices. However, the precise control of crystallization and morphology of organometallic perovskites deposited from solutions, considered crucial for enhancing the final photovoltaic performance, still remains challenging. In this context, here, we report on growing microcrystalline deposits of methylammonium lead triiodide perovskite, CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI(3)), by one-step solution casting on cylinder-shaped quartz substrates (rods) having diameters in the range of 80 to 1800 mu m. We show that the substrate curvature has a strong influence on morphology of the obtained polycrystalline deposits of MAPbI(3). Specifically, a marked size reduction of MAPbI(3) microcrystallites concomitant with an increased crystal packing density was observed with increasing the substrate curvatures. In contrast, although the crystallite width and length markedly decreased for substrates with higher curvatures, the photoluminescence (PL) spectral peak positions did not significantly evolve for MAPbI(3) deposits on substrates with different diameters. The crystallite size reduction and a denser coverage of microcrystalline MAPbI(3) deposits on cylinder-shaped substrates with higher curvatures were attributed to two major contributions, both related to the annealing step of the MAPbI(3) deposits. In particular, the diameter-dependent variability of the heat capacities and the substrate curvature-enhanced solvent evaporation rate seemed to contribute the most to the crystallization process and the resulting morphology changes of MAPbI(3) deposits on cylinder-shaped quartz substrates with various diameters. The longitudinal geometry of cylinder-shaped substrates provided also a facile solution for checking the PL response of the deposits of MAPbI(3) exposed to the flow of various gaseous media, such as oxygen (O-2), nitrogen (N-2), and argon (Ar). Specifically, under excitation with lambda(exc) = 546 nm, the rapid and pronounced decreases and increases of PL signals were observed under intermittent subsequent exposures to O-2 and N-2, respectively. Overall, the approach reported herein inspires novel, cylinder-shaped geometries of MAPbI(3) deposits, which can find applications in low-cost photo-optical devices, including gas sensors.",,,,"Matus, Peter/B-6582-2008","Matus, Peter/0000-0002-6076-3881; Sienkiewicz, Andrzej/0000-0003-3527-7379",,,,,,,,,,,,2330-4022,,,,,APR,2018,5,4,,,,,1476,1485,,10.1021/acsphotonics.7b01496,,,,,,,,WOS:000430642500042,,,,,

Recently, lead-halide two-dimensional (2D) OIHP were found to present bright broadband visible emission, thus, highlighting their potential as single component white-light (WL) emitters. This contribution deals with the preparation of a new Cd-based 2D hybrid perovskite, of the chemical formula (C6H11NH3)(2)CdBr4 (abbreviated as compound 1), of which structural and optical properties have been studied and analyzed. Room temperature optical absorption (OA) measurements, performed on spin-coated film of compound 1, revealed a sharp excitonic absorption peak at 3.24 eV, and a large exciton binding energy of 377 meV, estimated from low temperature OA spectrum. Upon 325 nm irradiation, compound 1 showed a very broadband WL emission consisting of one peak at 2.94 eV, attributed to exciton confined in the [CdBr4](2-) inorganic layers, and a second peak at 2.53 eV resulting from the cydohexylammonium cations emission. Temperature dependence of PL spectra evidenced anomalous behavior accompanied by singularities around 50 and 150 K in the integrated intensity, the full width at half-maximum and the PL peaks positions. These singularities have been traced back to structural phase transitions, from temperature dependence powder and single crystal X-ray diffraction investigations, from which strong correlations had emerged between the structural distortion of the CdBr6 pseudo-octahedron and the broadening characteristics of the WL emission band.

Such rapid progress has triggered research into approaches that can boost efficiencies beyond the Shockley-Queisser limit stipulated for a single-junction cell under normal solar illumination conditions. The tandem solar cell architecture is one concept here that has recently been successfully implemented. However, the approach of solar concentration has not been sufficiently explored so far for perovskite photovoltaics, despite its frequent use in the area of inorganic semiconductor solar cells. Here, the prospects of hybrid perovskites are assessed for use in concentrator solar cells. Solar cell performance parameters are theoretically predicted as a function of solar concentration levels, based on representative assumptions of charge-carrier recombination and extraction rates in the device. It is demonstrated that perovskite solar cells can fundamentally exhibit appreciably higher energy-conversion efficiencies under solar concentration, where they are able to exceed the Shockley-Queisser limit and exhibit strongly elevated open-circuit voltages.

Recently, two-dimensional (2D) perovskites are synthesized by isolating metal halide perovskite layers using aliphatic or aromatic alkylammonium spacer cation, which can retain their performance under ambient humidity levels due to the hydrophobic property of the spacer cation. However, the best 2D perovskite thus far, using aliphatic short butylammonium (BA) cation as spacer cation, shows only a modest tolerance against moisture and heat due to the inferior hydrophobicity as well as the relatively smaller size of the BA cation. Here, a bulkier aromatic phenylethylammonium (PEA) used as a spacer cation to synthesis 2D perovksite in order to achieve highly stable solar cells. By modifying the crystallization process, an average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.50% is achieved, which is the highest reported PCE for aromatic alkylammonium-based lower dimensional perovskite solar cells. Importantly, unencapsulated (PEA)(2)(MA)(3)Pb4I13 devices show enhanced moisture stability compared to other reported perovskite solar cells in harsh moisture environment (72 +/- 2% relative humidity).

In comparison, the pore size of mesoporous TiO2 first increased greatly before quickly decreasing, and a similar trend was also observed for electrical conductivity.

However, the large-scale commercialization of these technologies will depend on the ability of the active material to be stable under environmental and operating conditions.

Micro-Raman and photoluminescence show that the degradation starts from the edge of the cell due to moisture ingress. By using novel local Raman-transient photocurrent measurements, we were able to probe local ion migration in the degraded region and non-degraded region and found that the formation of PbI2 can passivate the perovskite by reducing ion migration. The degradation is far from uniform across different grains as revealed by secondary electron hyperspectral imaging, an advanced scanning electron microscopy technique which allows probing the composition of individual grains from the cross section. By using potential step chronoamperometry, we also found that the bias degradation is closely related to the density of mobile ions.

In a typical perovskite solar cell (PSC), the interface between electron transport layer (ETL) and perovskites is found to significantly influence the power conversion efficiency (PCE). Herein, Ultraviolet-ozone (UVO) treatment, a technique commonly used to clean a device substrate, is applied on ETL, specially, mesoporous/compact TiO2 layer. This treatment increases the conductivity of ETL and removes the residual organics at the surface. Consequently, an improved interface between mesoporous TiO2 and perovskite is achieved to enhance the performance of PSC. For example, the fill factor (FF) increases by similar to 13%, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) increase by similar to 2%, and the PCE finally enhances by similar to 20% with 15 min of UVO treatment. With this method, the PCE of the best cell reaches to 20.43% under the illumination of AM 1.5 (100 mW cm(-2)) simulated sunlight. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Another reason is that the phase structure changes from the tetragonal phase to the cubic phase when the temperature over 57 degrees C, which distorted the octahedron structure of PbI6. The structural distortion restricted the carrier's transport, leading to decreasing of the carrier's mobility. And the Seebeck coefficient was also rapidly dropped with the temperature increasing. In this article, we used photoexcitation-generated excited states could effectively restrain the decrease of electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient of CH3NH3PbI3 polycrystalline thin film, because the photoexcitation could greatly enhance the density of excited state, which increased charge carrier concentration and electrical conductivity. Moreover, thanks to the photoexcitation, the surface charge accumulation was increased significantly, enhancing the surface polarization at metal/Perovskite interface, simultaneously, enhancing the polarization effect of CH3NH3PbI3. The enhanced surface polarization functions as an additional driving force to diffuse the charge carriers from hot side to cold side, thus the carrier mobility was increased effectively, restraining the Seebeck coefficient's decrease caused by the crystal phase transition. Our experimental results showed that photoexcitation increased the electrical conductivity from 7.8x10(-6) S/m in the dark to 4x10(-5) S/m in illumination condition, the mobility increased from the 0.141 cm(2)/v. s in the dark to 13.122 cm(2)/v. s in illumination condition. Simultaneously, the Seebeck coefficient was also increased from 26 mu V/K to -17 mV/K with increasing light intensity from 0 to 100%. The Power Factor (PF) value of 11.51 nW/mK(2) in the illumination condition was further bigger than the PF of 5.27x10(-6) nW/mK(2) in the dark condition. As a result, our experiment further demonstrated that photoexcitation can be used as an effective way to simultaneously develop high Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity through excited states in an organic-inorganic semi-conducting material with multilayer electrode/perovskite/electrode thin-film device.",,,,,"sun, lin/0000-0003-0059-2854",,,,,,,,,,,,1566-1199,1878-5530,,,,APR,2018,55,,,,,,90,96,,10.1016/j.orgel.2018.01.014,,,,,,,,WOS:000425979000013,,,,,

The diverse dipolar interface materials (e.g., self-assembled monolayers, conjugated or nonconjugated polymer, neutral molecules or electrolytes, zwitterion based molecules, electrolyte grafted copolymer) are introduced and classified according to their working mechanisms of decoupled dipole moments at the interface. We conclude that an efficient interface material and its particular treatment can be designed and developed by exploring the underlying mechanisms of the decoupled dipole moments. Therefore, device characteristics may be advanced by the insights provided in this review.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2050-7526,2050-7534,,,,28-Mar,2018,6,12,,,,,2915,2924,,10.1039/c8tc00166a,,,,,,,,WOS:000428987500002,,,,,

Results on translucent perovskite modules with selectively tuned levels of transparency are reported by applying the industrially established fabrication process of partial area ablation to high efficiency opaque devices. After process completion, the final devices consist of opaque areas that absorb the light, and transparent areas that permit neutral light transmission. We compare the effectiveness of using two active area removal techniques: mechanical scribing and laser ablation, and determine the factors that limit the maximum transparency and power conversion efficiency. Moreover, we show how the choice of the ablation method and design of the active area removal pattern affect and limit the maximum light utilization efficiency ratio that can be achieved with this fabrication process.

However, the electrical conductivity of NiOx and the interface contact properties of the NiOx/perovskite layer are always limited for the NiOx layer fabricated at a relatively low annealing temperature. Ferrocenedicarboxylic acid (FDA) was firstly introduced to modify a p-type NiOx hole transport layer in PSCs, which obviously improves the crystallization of the perovskite layer and hole transport and collection abilities and reduces carrier recombination. PSCs with a FDA modified NiOx layer reached a PCE of 18.20%, which is much higher than the PCE (15.13%) of reference PSCs. Furthermore, PSCs with a FDA interfacial modification layer show better UV durability and a hysteresis-free effect and still maintain the original PCE value of 49.8% after being exposed to UV for 24 h. The enhanced performance of the PSCs is attributed to better crystallization of the perovskite layer, the passivation effect of FDA, superior interface contact at the NiOx/perovskite layers and enhancement of the electrical conductivity of the FDA modified NiOx layer. In addition, PSCs with FDA inserted at the interface of the perovskite/PCBM layers can also improve the PCE to 16.62%, indicating that FDA have dual functions to modify p-type and n-type carrier transporting layers.",,,,"Ou-Yang, Wei/A-5903-2009","Ou-Yang, Wei/0000-0002-0511-9225; Huang, Sumei/0000-0001-5283-3918; Zhang, Jiankai/0000-0003-1256-1449",,,,,,,,,,,,2040-3364,2040-3372,,,,28-Mar,2018,10,12,,,,,5617,5625,,10.1039/c7nr08750k,,,,,,,,WOS:000428787600026,29528068,,,,

Here, we explore a supramolecular approach based on the use of cyclodextrins (CDs) to modify the underlying solution chemistry. The peculiar phenomenon demonstrated is a tunable complexation between different CDs and MA(+) cations concurrent to an out of cage PbI2 intercalation, representing the first report of a connection between the solvation equilibria of the two perovskite precursors. The optimal conditions in terms of CD cavity size and polarity translate to a neat enhancement of PbI2 solubility in the reaction media, leading to an equilibration of the availability of the precursors in solution. The macroscopic result of this is an improved nucleation process, leading to a perovskite material with higher crystallinity, better optical properties and improved moisture resistance.

In spite of intensive developments in both materials and devices, electronic traps and defects that significantly affect their device properties remain under-investigated. Particularly, it remains challenging to identify and to resolve traps individually at the nanoscopic scale. Here, photo-active traps (PATs) are mapped over OIHP nanocrystal morphology of different crystallinity by means of correlative optical differential super-resolution localization microscopy (Delta-SRLM) and electron microscopy. Stochastic and monolithic photoluminescence intermittency due to individual PATs is observed on monocrystalline and polycrystalline OIHP nanocrystals. Delta-SRLM reveals a heterogeneous PAT distribution across nanocrystals and determines the PAT density to be 1.3 x 10(14) and 8 x 10(13) cm(-3) for polycrystalline and for monocrystalline nanocrystals, respectively. The higher PAT density in polycrystalline nanocrystals is likely related to an increased defect density. Moreover, monocrystalline nanocrystals that are prepared in an oxygen and moisture-free environment show a similar PAT density as that prepared at ambient conditions, excluding oxygen or moisture as chief causes of PATs. Hence, it is conduded that the PATs come from inherent structural defects in the material, which suggests that the PAT density can be reduced by improving crystalline quality of the material.",,,,"Keshavarz, Masoumeh/D-6089-2018; Lu, Gang/A-1893-2011; Bladt, Eva/O-6894-2017","Keshavarz, Masoumeh/0000-0003-3685-6778; Lu, Gang/0000-0003-1722-0176; Bladt, Eva/0000-0002-7610-4258; Janssen, Kris Pieter Frans/0000-0002-2181-9635",,,,,,,,,,,,0935-9648,1521-4095,,,,27-Mar,2018,30,13,,,,,,,1705494,10.1002/adma.201705494,,,,,,,,WOS:000428793600009,29457290,,,,

Herein, we demonstrate a new strategy in which zinc sulfide (ZnS) is used as an interfacial modifier between mesoporous-TiO2 (mp-TiO2) and a CH3NH3PbI3 absorber layer via the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method. The layer thickness of ZnS was optimized, and its effects on the conduction band position, interfacial charge recombination, and photovoltaic performance were investigated. Our results revealed that an ultrathin ZnS layer on mp-TiO2 helps in suppressing backflow of electrons, effectively reducing interfacial charge recombination and facilitating electron transfer. Our best performing perovskite solar cell device using the mp-TiO2-ZnS achieved a power conversion efficiency of 14.9%, with an open-circuit voltage of 1.02 V, short-circuit current density of 19.05mA cm(-2), and fill factor of 75.43%.

The ability to tune the perovskite bandgap continuously by modifying the chemical composition opens up applications for perovskites as coloured emitters, in building-integrated photovoltaics, and as components of tandem photovoltaics to increase the power conversion efficiency(2-4). Nevertheless, performance is limited by non-radiative losses, with luminescence yields in state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells still far from 100 per cent under standard solar illumination conditions(5-7). Furthermore, in mixed halide perovskite systems designed for continuous bandgap tunability(2) (bandgaps of approximately 1.7 to 1.9 electronvolts), photoinduced ion segregation leads to bandgap instabilities(8,9). Here we demonstrate substantial mitigation of both non-radiative losses and photoinduced ion migration in perovskite films and interfaces by decorating the surfaces and grain boundaries with passivating potassium halide layers. We demonstrate external photoluminescence quantum yields of 66 per cent, which translate to internal yields that exceed 95 per cent. The high luminescence yields are achieved while maintaining high mobilities of more than 40 square centimetres per volt per second, providing the elusive combination of both high luminescence and excellent charge transport(10). When interfaced with electrodes in a solar cell device stack, the external luminescence yielda quantity that must be maximized to obtain high efficiencyremains as high as 15 per cent, indicating very clean interfaces. We also demonstrate the inhibition of transient photoinduced ion-migration processes across a wide range of mixed halide perovskite bandgaps in materials that exhibit bandgap instabilities when unpassivated. We validate these results in fully operating solar cells.

The inclusion of the Zr(Ac)(4) buffer layer leads to the increase of FF from similar to 68% to similar to 79% and PCE from similar to 14% to similar to 17% in the planar PSCs. The UPS measurement indicates that the Zr(Ac)(4) layer has a low HOMO level of -8.2 eV, indicating that the buffer layer can act as a hole-blocking layer. Surface morphology and surface chemistry investigations reveal that the elements I, MA and Pb can diffuse across the PCBM ETL, damaging the device performance. The covering Zr(Ac)(4) molecules fill in the pinholes of the PCBM layer and effectively block the ions/molecules of the perovskite from diffusion across the ETL. The resulting more robust PCBM/Zr(Ac)(4) ETL leads to weaker ionic charge accumulation and lower diode leakage current. The double role of hole-and-ion blocking of the Zr(Ac)(4) layer explains the improved FF and PCE in the PSCs.",,,,"He, Zhiqun/B-4906-2010","He, Zhiqun/0000-0002-2002-3061",,,,,,,,,,,,1463-9076,1463-9084,,,,21-Mar,2018,20,11,,,,,7395,7400,,10.1039/c8cp00563j,,,,,,,,WOS:000428235800003,29508866,,,,

A physical model for the current/voltage curve of pin solar cells is used to reveal the beneficial impact of thinning on cell efficiency. If interface recombination is kept at moderate levels, the model shows that there is a potential efficiency increase above 20% relative (+3% absolute) when thickness is reduced from 500 to 200nm, provided total light absorption is maintained. A rigorous optical model is employed to calculate light absorption on typical state-of-the-art layer stacks patterned with sinusoidal grooves on ITO coated glass. The results suggest that solar light absorption in a flat, 500nm thick film, can be matched by a 200nm thick perovskite layer on a sinusoidal texture, while using 300nm leads to several sinusoidal parameter combinations delivering the same light absorption. Since the structuring step must be compatible with low cost processing, it is shown that direct laser interference patterning (DLIP) is capable of delivering +3% absolute efficiency increase, while offering a typical photovoltaic module cost reduction of 10%.",,,,,"Soldera, Marcos/0000-0002-3990-5187",,,,,,,,,,,,1862-6300,1862-6319,,,,21-Mar,2018,215,6,,,,,,,1700906,10.1002/pssa.201700906,,,,,,,,WOS:000428341000018,,,,,

Interestingly, the introduction of the chalcogen atoms resulted in a drastic reduction in the electronic band gap, which made some of the compounds fall within the visible range of the solar spectrum.

The modified model captures the light-absorption-dependent short-circuit current, contact and transport-layer-modified carrier transport, as well as recombination and photon-recycling-influenced open-circuit voltage. The theoretical and experimental results show that for experimentally optimized perovskite solar cells with the power conversion efficiency of 19%, optical loss of 25%, nonradiative recombination loss of 35%, and ohmic loss of 35% are the three dominant loss factors for approaching the 31% efficiency limit of perovskite solar cells. It is also found that the optical loss climbs up to 40% for a thin-active-layer design. Moreover, a misconfigured transport layer introduces above 15% of energy loss. Finally, the perovskite-interface-induced surface recombination, ohmic loss, and current leakage should be further reduced to upgrade device efficiency and eliminate hysteresis effect. This work contributes to fundamental understanding of device physics of perovskite solar cells.

ZnO has been well-documented as an excellent electron-transport material. However, the poor chemical compatibility between ZnO and organo-metal halide perovskite makes it highly challenging to obtain highly efficient and stable PSCs using ZnO as the electron-transport layer. It is demonstrated in this work that the surface passivation of ZnO by a thin layer of MgO and protonated ethanolamine (EA) readily makes ZnO as a very promising electron-transporting material for creating hysteresis-free, efficient, and stable PSCs. Systematic studies in this work reveal several important roles of the modification: (i) MgO inhibits the interfacial charge recombination, and thus enhances cell performance and stability; (ii) the protonated EA promotes the effective electron transport from perovskite to ZnO, further fully eliminating PSCs hysteresis; (iii) the modification makes ZnO compatible with perovskite, nicely resolving the instability of ZnO/perovskite interface.

However, the presence of lead (Pb) in perovskite composition as a toxic element still remains a major issue for large-scale deployment. In this work, a novel and facile technique is presented to fabricate tin (Sn)-rich perovskite film using metal precursors and an alloying technique. Herein, the perovskite films are formed as a result of the reaction between Sn/Pb binary alloy metal precursors and methylammonium iodide (MAI) vapor in a chemical vapor deposition process carried out at 185 degrees C. It is found that in this approach the Pb/Sn precursors are first converted to (Pb/Sn)I-2 and further reaction with MAI vapor leads to the formation of perovskite films. By using Pb-Sn eutectic alloy, perovskite films with large grain sizes up to 5 mu m can be grown directly from liquid phase metal. Consequently, using an alloying technique and this unique growth mechanism, a less-toxic and efficient perovskite solar cell with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.04% is demonstrated, while pure Sn and Pb perovskite solar cells prepared in this manner yield PCEs of 4.62% and 14.21%, respectively.

In general, we found that these devices keep their original electric properties and withstand a humid environment better. Chemical analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals the presence of coordinating water in the CH3NH3PbI3 crystalline structure.

There are several studies focused on understanding degradation under operating conditions in light, but little is known about the stability of these solar cells under reverse bias conditions. Reverse bias stability is important because shaded cells in a module are put into reverse bias by the illuminated cells. In this paper, a phenomenological study is presented of the reverse bias behavior of halide perovskite solar cells and it is shown that reverse bias can lead to a partially recoverable loss in efficiency, primarily caused by a decrease in V-OC. A general mechanism is proposed, supported by drift-diffusion simulations, to explain how these cells breakdown via tunneling caused by accumulated ionic defects and suggests that the reversible loss in efficiency may be due to an electrochemical reaction of these defects. Finally, the implications of these phenomena are discussed and how they can possibly be addressed is also discussed.",,,,,"Bertoluzzi, Luca/0000-0002-4145-6069; McGehee, Michael/0000-0001-9609-9030",,,,,,,,,,,,1614-6832,1614-6840,,,,15-Mar,2018,8,8,,,,,,,1702365,10.1002/aenm.201702365,,,,,,,,WOS:000427968900022,,,,,

Here, we prepare the compact CH3NH3PbI3 thin films by the two-step method at a low temperature (<80 degrees C) and investigate the effects of PbI2 crystallization on the structure property correlation in the CH3NH3PbI3 films. It is found that the importance of the crystallization in PbI2 matrix lies in governing the transition from the (001) plane of trigonal PM, to the (002) plane of tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3 in the rapid reaction process for atoms to coordinate into perovskite during spin-coating, which actually determines the morphology and the type of vacancy defects in resulting perovskite; a better crystallized PbI2 film has a much stronger ability to react with CH3NH3I solution and produces larger CH3NH3PbI3 grains with a higher crystallinity. The CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 planar solar cell derived from a better crystallized PbI2 film exhibits significantly improved performance and stability as the result of the higher crystallinity inside the perovskite film. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the crystalline PhI2 film matrix subjected to the annealing after a slow heating process prior to contacting CH3NH3I solution is more effective for CH3NH3PbI3 formation than that with a direct annealing history.

At first, the C-V analysis proved the energy levels of the frontier orbitals for CON-10 and CON-16 nanosheets; this verified the suitability of these nanosheets as hole transport layers (HTLs) with the PEDOT:PSS upon casting both films from DMSO. It became evident, however, that the hole transport property of the PEDOT: PSS on the CON-16 layer was unfavorable with the increasing UPS-proven hole injection barrier. In addition, both CONs induced a rough surface morphology; however, CON-10 showed a relatively smooth surface as compared to CON-16 based on the Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Atomic force microscopy (AFM) profiles; furthermore, their surface properties influenced both the PEDOT: PSS layers and the perovskite layers. Especially, the XRD profiles presented an enhanced crystallinity of the perovskite layers with CON-10. All these aspects indicate that CON-10 is a more effective HTL material, and several versions of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been fabricated with/without CON-10 and CON-16 together with the PEDOT: PSS to determine the more-HTL-suitable CON.

Herein, polymer poly-vinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-induced surface passivation engineering is reported to synthesize extra-long-term stable cubic CsPbI3. It is revealed that acylamino groups of PVP induce electron cloud density enhancement on the surface of CsPbI3, thus lowering surface energy, conducive to stabilize cubic CsPbI3 even in micrometer scale.

To elucidate the interface dynamics and its impact on the electron transfer process, we have studied the interfacial features of a TiO2/MAPbI(3) system. First principles calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations show that the rotational freedom of MA present within the bulk is considerably suppressed due to interaction of MA with the TiO2 substrate, highlighting orientationally ordered MA at the interface. The optimized interface structure shows the C-N axis of MA titled towards the TiO2 surface so as to maximize the interaction between N-attached H and underlying O. The very short O center dot center dot center dot H center dot center dot center dot N distance with very large hydrogen bonding energy identifies short strong hydrogen bonding (SSHB) as the origin of structural re-organization at the interface. As for the electronic structure, this proton sharing between MA and TiO2 has a critical impact on the energy level alignment at the interface, thus driving the electron transfer process from MA to TiO2.

Here, self-healing in perovskite (methylammonium, formamidinium, and cesium lead bromide (MAPbBr(3), FAPbBr(3), and CsPbBr3)) single crystals is reported, using two-photon microscopy to create damage (photobleaching) approximate to 110 mu m inside the crystals and to monitor the recovery of photoluminescence after the damage. Self-healing occurs in all three perovskites with FAPbBr(3) the fastest (approximate to 1 h) and CsPbBr3 the slowest (tens of hours) to recover. This behavior, different from surface-dominated stability trends, is typical of the bulk and is strongly dependent on the localization of degradation products not far from the site of the damage.

[6,6]-Phenyl-C-61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) is the most commonly used n-type material in BHJ perovskite solar cells owing to its high electron mobility. However, it is very difficult to fabricate BHJ perovskite films because of the poor solubility of PC61BM in the commonly used solvent dimethylformamide (DMF). In this study, we introduced two kinds of fluorinated PC61BM (3F-PC61BM and 5F-PC61BM) as n-type materials in a BHJ perovskite film, which have higher solubility in DMF than that of PC61BM. Thus, a BHJ perovskite film can be easily fabricated in one step using a single solvent in a BHJ precursor solution system for planar perovskite solar cells. A BHJ device with a high PCE of 16.17% can be obtained by adding 0.1wt% of 3F-PC61BM in a perovskite precursor solution to fabricate a solar cell, which outperforms the PCE of 14.12% of the pristine device. However, the addition of 5F-PC61BM decreased the PCE to lower than that of the pristine device regardless of its amount. We systematically studied the effects of the amount and type of fluorinated PC61BM on the morphology of BHJ perovskite films using SEM, AFM, GISAXS and GIWAXS. The results reveal that 3F-PC61BM can fill the pinholes between perovskite grains and passivate the defects in the pristine film. Thus, the current density (J(sc)) is greatly increased. On the other hand, the self-aggregation of 5F-PC61BM in BHJ perovskite films caused the films to be full of large voids, which led to poor device performance. The dense and flat surface morphology of BHJ perovskite films containing 3F-PC61BM can also prevent the permeation of moisture into grain boundaries and enhance the device stability. Therefore, the device could maintain 80% of its original efficiency over 550 hours without any encapsulation in comparison with 240 hours for the pristine device.

The proposition of guanidinium (GUA)-doped perovskite materials generated considerable interest due to their potential to increase carrier lifetimes and open-circuit voltages as compared to pure MAPbI(3). However, simple size considerations based on the Goldschmidt tolerance factor suggest that guanidinium is too big to completely replace methylammonium as an A cation in the APbI(3) perovskite lattice, and its effect was thus ascribed to passivation of surface trap states at grain boundaries. As guanidinium was not thought to incorporate into the MAPbI(3) lattice, interest waned since it appeared unlikely that it could be used to modify the intrinsic perovskite properties. Here, using solid-state NMR, we provide for the first time atomic-level evidence that GUA is directly incorporated into the MAPbI(3) and FAPbI(3) lattices, forming pure GUA(x)MA(1-x)PbI(3) or GUA(x)FAI(1-x)PbI(3) phases, and that it reorients on the picosecond time scale within the perovskite lattice, which explains its superior charge carrier stabilization capacity.

However, their lead component is a high human health concern, toxic, and causes strong damages when disperse in the environment. In the present paper, silver iodobismuthate compounds are investigated as lead-free semiconductors in replacement of organolead halide in perovskite solar cells. We describe the design of thin films of AgBixI3x (+) (1) for x composition ranging between 1 and 2.25. The preparation is optimized to get well-crystallized well-covering layers. The prepared compounds are semiconductors, absorbing light below 700 nm. Compounds for x < 1.5 have a pure rhombohedral phase. Ag2Bi3I11 is crystallized in the pure cubic phase, yields to the layer with the largest grains and is the composition giving the best solar cell power conversion efficiency (PCE). For higher Bi content, a mixture of cubic AgBi3I11 and BiI3 is produced. The device design includes the use of a SnO2 hole blocking layer to get good efficiency.

Since the first report in 2009, the recorded power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has rapidly risen to 22.1% by using 2, 2', 7, 7'-tetrakis (N, Ndi-p-methoxyphenyl- amine) 9,9-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeoTAD) as hole transport material (HTM), with the efforts devoted to the device architecture optimization, material compositional engineer and interface engineering. Nevertheless, the synthesis and cost of the organic HTM (OHTM) become a major challenging issue and therefore alternative materials are required. In the past few years, the applications of inorganic HTMs (IHTMs) in PSCs have shown large improvement in PCE and stability. For example, PSCs with CuOx as IHTM reached a PCE of 19.0% with better stability. Even more exciting, the theoretical PCE of PSC based on Cu2O HTM reaches 24.4%. So, Cu2O is a promising IHTM for future optimized PSC and the large area uniform preparation is very important. In this paper, Cu2O films have been successfully prepared using electron beam evaporation followed by air annealing. The influences of annealing temperature and time on the composition, structure, and photoelectric characteristics of film are investigated in detail. It is found that the as-deposited film is a mixture of Cu2O and Cu. With the increase of annealing temperature, material composition is transformed from mixture to pure Cu2O phase, and then to CuO, due to the oxidation in air. In an annealing temperature between 100 degrees C to 150 degrees C, pure Cu2O film can be obtained with an average transmission rate over 70%, optical band-gap of similar to 2.5 eV, HOMO level of 5.32 eV, and a carrier mobility of similar to 30 cm(2).V-1.s(-1). When the film is treated with a UV lamp, the structure and composition of the film can be changed more easily because of the enhancement of oxidation. Finally, reverted planar PSCs with the structure of Ag/PCBM/CH3NH3PbI3/HTMs/ITO are constructed and compared carefully based on HTMs of Cu2O, with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate)(PEDOT: PSS), and Cu2O/PEDOT: PSS layers, respectively. An optimum thickness of 40 nm of Cu2O HTM is achieved with high carrier extraction rate. However, the performances of all of the PSCs are inferior to those of PEDOT: PSS-based devices, due to the formation of pinholesin absorber layer resulting from the strong hydrophobicity of Cu2O film. However, the efficiency of PSC based on Cu2O/PEDOT: PSS double-HTM is deteriorated because of the chemical interaction between PEDOT: PSS and Cu2O. These findings provide some important guidelines for the design of HTMs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1000-3290,,,,,5-Mar,2018,67,5,,,,,,,53301,10.7498/aps.67.20172463,,,,,,,,WOS:000428113900011,,,,,

In this work, we studied in a systematic approach the influence of CH3NH3CI (MACI) surface treatment in the acetonitrile (ACN) deposition route. This method does not require vacuum nor solvent quenching steps, which make it probably one of the easiest for transference from lab scale to large-area deposition techniques such as roll-to-roll printing. The properties of perovskite films grown by ACN method and the influence of the MAC1 on the performance of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are characterized in detail by different techniques. By atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) we found significant differences in the morphology and the work function of the perovskite with and without MACI treatment. Moreover, the microstructure presents very different behavior: after being exposed to radiation, the MACI treated sample presented passivated grain boundaries and higher intensity in the photoluminescence (PL) emission. The higher PL for perovskite films with MAC! treatment correlates with superior photovoltaic parameters of PSCs. All these features lead to highly homogeneous perovskite layers on large areas enabling the fabrication of 10 X 10 cm(2) solar minimodules processed in air at low temperature (<100 C). For these minimodules, we reached a PCE up to 9.2% with an aperture area of 40 cm2.

Our work is to understand the ionic transport mechanism by introducing suitable halogen substitution with insignificant impact on light absorption to hinder ion diffusion and thereby to seek a method to improve the stability. Herein, we used first-principles density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the band gaps and the optical absorption coefficients, and the interstitial and the vacancy defect diffusion barriers of halide in the orthogonal phase MAPbX(3) (MA = CH3NH3, X = I, Br, I0.5Br0.5) perovskite, respectively. The research results show that a half bromine substitution not only prevents ion migration in perovskite, but also maintains a favorable light absorption capacity.

The passivation results in the increase in photoluminescence intensity and carrier lifetimes of test structures and open-circuit voltages (V-OC) of the devices as long as the addition of PEA(+) is <= 4.5%. The presence of higher-band-gap quasi-2D PEA incorporated perovskite is responsible for the grain boundary passivation, and the quasi-2D perovskites are also found to be concentrated near the TiO2 layer, revealed by PL spectroscopy.

Incorporation of Cs+ cations in FAPbBr(3) significantly reduced the average grain size (to 199 nm for FA:Cs = 90:10) and trap density; these changes consequently increased PL quantum efficiency (PLQE) and PL lifetime of FA(1-x)Cs(x)PbBr(3) films and current efficiency (CE) of PeLEDs.

To investigate the electron-and hole-transfer dynamics in ultrafast time scale, we have performed femtosecond up-conversion and femtosecond transient absorption studies. The measured electron-transfer time from CPB NCs to CdSe QDs and hole-transfer time from CdSe QDs to CPB NCs were found to be 550 and 750 fs, respectively. Interestingly, the charge-transfer process found to be restricted in CPB/CdSe@CdS core-shell system where electron transfer from CPB NCs to core shell takes place, but the hole transfer from core shell to CPB NCs found to be restricted due to CdS shell making the process thermodynamically nonviable. Our observation has suggested that after the photoexcitation of CPB NCs/CdSe QDs composite system, a charge-separated state is formed where the electrons are localized in CB of CdSe QDs and holes are localized in VB of CPB NCs.

Recent studies suggest that most photoexcitations in perovskites are free charge carriers, although the contribution of the electron-hole pairs (i.e., excitons) at room temperature has been a matter of debate. We have employed ultrafast two-dimensional (2D) electronic spectroscopy to directly probe the elementary optical excitation of CH3NH3PbI3 thin films with similar to 16 fs temporal resolution. We distinctly capture the ultrafast dissociation of excitons to the charge carriers at room temperature and at 180 K. Interestingly, we also observe that the coherent oscillations of the off-diagonal signals in the 2D electronic spectra live for similar to 50 fs at room temperature. The entropy-driven dissociation of excitons to charge carriers happens within the electronic dephasing time scale and is favored by the low exciton binding energy, which we determine to be similar to 12 meV at room temperature.

It is demonstrated that polythiophene, deposited on the top of CsPbI2Br, can significantly reduce electron-hole recombination within the perovskite, which is due to the electronic passivation of surface defect states. In addition, the interfacial properties are improved by a simple annealing process, leading to significantly reduced energy disorder in polythiophene and enhanced hole-injection into the hole-acceptor. Consequently, one of the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.02% from a reverse scan in inorganic mixed-halide perovskite solar cells is obtained.

In this work, heat-resistant borosilicate glass paper, showing extraordinary flexibility and being able to be treated at high temperature (ca. 500 degrees C), is used as the substrate for flexible dyesensitized solar cells (DSSCs) for the first time. High-quality photoanodes were prepared via a novel sequent filling method with the aid of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and ice layers, leading to smooth and continuous TiO2 film. A completely different device structure compared to the conventional design was also brought about, by taking advantage of using this photoanode as solid-state electrolyte supporter and being further connected with the counter-electrode. The prototype solar cell was successfully demonstrated for the first time, with a decent initiating photovoltaic performance, resulting in an efficiency of 0.85% (open-circuit voltage, V-oc = 0.67V; short-circuit current density, J(sc) = 3.76 mA cm(-2); fill factor, FF = 0.34). This work provides a new prospective for fabricating flexible DSSCs, which successfully resolved the long-term stability issues due to the incompatibility of high temperature sintering and front-side illumination existing in polymer and metal foils respectively.

Though great progress has been achieved, their power conversion efficiencies are still relatively low compared with hole-transport-materials-based PSCs. General research on influencing factors of performance in PC-based PSCs is still insufficient. In this work, PC-based PSCs were fabricated in ambient air and four groups of controlled experiments were performed in which the PbI2 layers were prepared with or without antisolvent extraction treatment. These four groups of experiments were designed to find out the effect of different influencing factors on PC-based PSCs performance, for example, PbI2 residual, the surface morphology of the perovskite film, the surface roughness of the perovskite film, and the contact status of the perovskite/carbon electrode interface. With a systematic analysis, we demonstrated that the contact status of the perovskite/carbon electrode interface played a vital role in PC-based PSCs, and a flat, smooth perovskite surface could help to improve this contact status significantly. Besides, on the precondition of a poor contact interface, no PbI2 residual and a good surface morphology only brought limited benefits to the performances of PC-based PSCs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1674-1056,1741-4199,,,,MAR,2018,27,3,,,,,,,38402,10.1088/1674-1056/27/3/038402,,,,,,,,WOS:000428452600002,,,,,

Unfortunately, chemical stability is one major challenge in the development of CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells. It was commonly assumed that moisture or oxygen in the environment causes the poor stability of hybrid halide perovskites, however, here we show from the first-principles calculations that the room-temperature tetragonal phase of CH3NH3PbI3 is thermodynamically unstable with respect to the phase separation into CH3NH3I + PbI2, i.e., the disproportionation is exothermic, independent of the humidity or oxygen in the atmosphere. When the structure is distorted to the low-temperature orthorhombic phase, the energetic cost of separation increases, but remains small. Contributions from vibrational and configurational entropy at room temperature have been considered, but the instability of CH3NH3PbI3 is unchanged. When I is replaced by Br or Cl, Pb by Sn, or the organic cation CH3NH3 by inorganic Cs, the perovskites become more stable and do not phase-separate spontaneously.

W.",,,Band engineering of multicomponent semiconductors: a general theoretical model on the anion group,ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Development of energy conversion semiconductor materials has attracted increasing interest over the past three decades, but most successful semiconductors are unary or binary, rather than multicomponent semiconductors (MCSCs). There is a several orders of magnitude wider variety of MCSCs than unary and binary semiconductors, but very few electronic energy theories have been able to deal with more than two composition variables so far, and thus desired MCSCs are hard to predict. In this work, we propose a universal anion group model based on the analysis of electronic structures in an ABO(3) perovskite prototype. Under a first order approximation, that is, the A' cation and the (BO6) anion group have very little hybridization, we find that the band gap of the ABO(3) semiconductor is mainly determined by the (BO6) anion group and is very similar to that of binary compounds consisting of the same anion group constituents, while the band edges can be adjusted by the A'-site cation. When more intense hybridizations exist, the predicted results can be amended by considering the higher order approximation. Using this model, the band gaps and edges of quaternary AgxNa(1-x)NbO3 perovskites and ZnxMg(1-x)Fe2O4 spinels have been predicted and are consistent with reported experiments and first principles calculations, further confirming the validity of the proposed model. Therefore, an anion group model on MCSCs can not only promote the probability of success in band engineering, but can also pave the way for speeding up the design of novel and desired MCSCs using known binary semiconductors for use in the field of energy conversion materials as photocatalysts, light-emitting materials, complementary light-absorption materials for solar cells, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1754-5692,1754-5706,,,,1-Mar,2018,11,3,,,,,692,701,,10.1039/c7ee03503a,,,,,,,,WOS:000428184700019,,,,,

Organic-inorganic lead halide perovskites have gained popularity due to their low-temperature solution processability, low electronic defect density and low structural and thermal disorder. Nonetheless, their single crystals suffer from lower carrier mobility (similar to 10-100 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)) than those in inorganic semiconductors and slow radiative recombination rates, with average lifetimes exceeding one mu s. Recently, CsPbBr3, an all-inorganic lead-bromide perovskite also attracted great attention due to its high thermal stability and fast radiative recombination. Therefore, it is required to explore the exciton and lattice dynamics of solution processed CsPbBr3 thin films. Here, we show that CsPbBr3 exhibits an electron-phonon coupling strength (similar to 70 meV) comparable with its organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite counterpart CH3NH3PbBr3 (similar to 60 meV). The main source of electron-phonon coupling was identified to be the longitudinal-optical phonon mode of the Pb-Br lattice vibration at similar to 20 meV. Carrier recombination studies by temperature-dependent steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence revealed that recombination occurred from lattice-bound carriers at room-temperature and in inert atmosphere. Carrier lifetimes are short and show a distinct temperature-dependence. All findings are supported by first-principles calculations in the framework of density-functional theory.

The vast majority of study has focused on Pb-based perovskites, which have limited applications because of their inherent toxicity. To enable the broad application of these materials, the properties of lead-free halide perovskites must be explored. Here, two-dimensional, lead-free cesium tin iodide, (CsSnI3), perovskite nanoplates have been synthesized and characterized for the first time. These CsSnI3 nanoplates exhibit thicknesses of less than 4 nm and exhibit significant quantum confinement with photoluminescence at 1.59 eV compared to 1.3 eV in the bulk. Ab initio calculations employing the generalized gradient approximation of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof elucidate that although the dominant intrinsic defects in CsSnI3 do not introduce deep levels inside the band gap, their concentration can be quite high. These simulations also highlight that synthesizing and processing CsSnI3 in Sn-rich conditions can reduce defect density and increase stability, which matches insights gained experimentally. This improvement in the understanding of CsSnI3 represents a step toward the broader challenge of building a deeper understanding of Sn-based halide perovskites and developing design principles that will lead to their successful application in optoelectronic devices.",,,,"Kang, Jun/F-7105-2011; Alivisatos, Paul/N-8863-2015; McCoy, Tina/P-3402-2019","Kang, Jun/0000-0003-4788-0028; Alivisatos, Paul/0000-0001-6895-9048; Yu, Yi/0000-0003-4326-5992",,,,,,,,,,,,1530-6984,1530-6992,,,,MAR,2018,18,3,,,,,2060,2066,,10.1021/acs.nanolett.8b00077,,,,,,,,WOS:000427910600069,29504759,,,,

However, the energy lost in this process is much larger than for inorganic and perovskite solar cells, currently limiting the power conversion efficiency of OSCs to values slightly below 14%. To quantify energy losses, the open-circuit voltage of the solar cell is often compared to its optical gap. The latter is, however, not obvious to determine for organic materials which have broad absorption and emission bands, and is often done erroneously. Nevertheless, a deeper understanding of the energy loss mechanisms depends crucially on an accurate determination of the energies of the excited states involved in the photo-conversion process.

In recent years, organiceinorganic halide perovskite solar cells have emerged as a promising high-performance, cost-effective solar cell technology. However, most of the best reported efficiencies have been obtained on small active-area devices (similar to 0.1 cm(2)). Therefore, development of protocols to industrialize such a technology is of paramount importance.

Long-term stability is discussed, focusing on lifetime measurement and quantification protocols for commercialization. Cost-performance and life-cycle assessment analysis based on recently reported state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells are discussed. These analyses offer insights regarding required efficiency, module area size, and lifetime, in order for perovskite solar cells to be competitive with existing photovoltaic technologies.

It is therefore also one of the most discussed factors in all photovoltaic research fields. Lifetime evaluation of solar cells is frequently conducted via both optical and electrical means with the purpose of obtaining a deeper understanding of the dominant performance limiting recombination mechanisms. In many earlier recombination designations, performed via transient electrical means in novel thin film solar cells, the lifetime has been observed to be a decaying exponential function of the open circuit voltage. In this work we re-evaluate these previously assigned lifetimes as often being severely influenced by capacitive decay rates of spatially separated charge carriers. These lifetimes have thus very little in common with lifetimes relevant under steady state operational conditions of the solar cell. We show that the problem of lifetime determination via electrical means arises from that the relaxation of such charges, being associated with quasi-static capacitances of geometric type or from space-charge regions in the device, is also a decaying exponential function of the instantaneous open circuit voltage. This misconception hence also explains the often observed large discrepancy between optically and electrically determined lifetimes.

We demonstrate that photoinduced phase segregation in mixed halide perovskites selectively occurs at the grain boundaries rather than within the grain centers by using shear-force scanning probe microscopy in combination with confocal optical spectroscopy. Such difference is further evidenced by light-biased bulk Fourier-transform photocurrent spectroscopy, which shows the iodine-rich domain as a minority phase coexisting with the homogeneously mixed phase during illumination. By mapping the surface potential of mixed-halide perovskites, we evidence the higher concentration of positive space charge near the grain boundary possibly provides the initial driving force for phase segregation, while entropic mixing dominates the reverse process. Our work offers detailed insight into the microscopic processes occurring at the boundary of crystalline perovskite grains and will support the development of better passivation strategies, ultimately allowing the processing of more environmentally stable perovskite films.",,,,"Meixner, Alfred J./P-3260-2019","Meixner, Alfred J./0000-0002-0187-2906",,,,,,,,,,,,1530-6984,1530-6992,,,,MAR,2018,18,3,,,,,2172,2178,,10.1021/acs.nanolett.8b00505,,,,,,,,WOS:000427910600085,29498866,,,,

Our results indicate that the enhancement of nonequilibrium quantum transport properties is largely determined by SOC. The calculated current density for noncollinear spin polarization including SOC is about 1 order of magnitude higher than that for no spin polarization, resulting from the increase of nonequilibrium transmission coefficient in the bias window and the increase of electron density in the conduction band contributed by the p-state of Pb.

Long nonradiative lifetimes occur if the transfer of electronic into vibrational energy is slow due to, e.g., a low trap density, weak electron phonon coupling, or the requirement to release many phonons in the electronic transition. Here, we combine known material properties of MHPs with basic models for electron phonon coupling and multiphonon-transition rates in polar semiconductors. We find that the low phonon energies of MAPbI(3) lead to a strong dependence of recombination rates on trap position, which we deduce from the underlying physical effects determining nonradiative transitions. This is important for nonradiative recombination in MHPs, as it implies that they are rather insensitive to defects that are not at midgap energy, which can lead to long lifetimes. Therefore, the low phonon energies of MHPs are likely an important factor for their optoelectronic performance.",,,,"Rau, Uwe/G-2256-2011; Egger, David A/M-8926-2015; Kirchartz, Thomas/G-7687-2014","Rau, Uwe/0000-0003-3526-3081; Kirchartz, Thomas/0000-0002-6954-8213",,,,,,,,,,,,1948-7185,,,,,1-Mar,2018,9,5,,,,,939,+,,10.1021/acs.jpclett.7b03414,,,,,,,,WOS:000426803200002,29409323,,,,

Experiments demonstrate significant reduction in the recombination rate upon passivation of methylammonium lead iodide perovskite with Lewis base molecules. Using nonadiabatic molecular dynamics combined with time-domain density functional theory, we find that the nonradiative charge recombination is decelerated by an order of magnitude upon adsorption of the molecules. Thiophene acts by the traditional passivation mechanism, forcing electron density away from the surface. In contrast, pyridine localizes the electron at the surface while leaving it energetically near the conduction band edge. This is because pyridine creates a stronger coordinative bond with a lead atom of the perovskite and has a lower energy unoccupied orbital compared with thiophene due to the more electronegative nitrogen atom relative to thiophene's sulfur. Both molecules reduce two-fold the nonadiabatic coupling and electronic coherence time. A broad range of vibrational modes couple to the electronic subsystem, arising from inorganic and organic components.

Of these, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) constitute a promising technology due to their relatively low cost, moderate conversion efficiency, and robust mechanical properties. An important breakthrough in the development of DSSCs is the use of polymer gel electrolytes. In this work, we employ amphiphilic thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) in the form of sulfonated block ionomer (SBI) homologs for this purpose. Since the midblock of each charged copolymer is hydrophilic, the resultant microphase-separated nanostructures consist of continuous ionic channels that facilitate electron diffusion. A unique characteristic of the SBI archetype studied here is that the morphology can be solvent-templated. We exploit this feature by introducing either hydrophilic or hydrophobic photosensitizers into the DSSCs. When the SBI exhibits a primarily lamellar morphology, a hydrophilic dye yields the highest efficiency (7.0%), whereas the opposite is observed when the nanostructure consists of a solvent-templated nonpolar matrix.

Unfortunately, it is still challenging to prepare high-performance CsPbBr3 films at moderate temperatures. Herein, a uniform, compact CsPbB(r)3 film was fabricated using its quantum dot (QD)-based ink precursor. The film was then treated using thiocyanate ethyl acetate (EA) solution in all-ambient conditions to produce a superior CsPbBr3-CsPb2Br5 composite film with a larger grain size and minimal defects. The achievement was attributed to the surface dissolution and recrystallization of the existing SCN- and EA. More specifically, the SCN- ions were first absorbed on the Pb atoms, leading to the dissolution and stripping of Cs+ and Br- ions from the CsPbBr3 QDs. On the other hand, the EA solution enhances the diffusion dynamics of surface atoms and the surfactant species. It is found that a small amount of CsPb2Br5 in the composite film gives the best surface passivation, while the Br-rich surface decreases Br vacancies (V-Br) for a prolonged carrier lifetime.

Local J-V curves recorded on these grains further suggest an anti-correlation behavior between the short circuit current (J(SC)) and open circuit voltage (V-OC). This phenomenon can be attributed to diffusion-limited surface recombination at the non-selective perovskite-tip contact, where a higher carrier mobility established in the perovskite grain results in an enhanced surface recombination and thus a lower VOC.

Detailed characterization and analysis reveal improved passivation of the PbS CQDs with the CsPbI3-P coating, and the results suggest that the lattice coherence between CsPbI3-P and PbS results in epitaxial induced growth of the CsPbI3-P coating.

To investigate the effect of different contacted surfaces of a light absorber with an electron transporting layer, TiO2, we synthesize CsPbBr3/TiO2 thin films with two different interfaces (CsBr/TiO2 and PbBr2/TiO2). Both interfacial heterostructures exhibit enhanced visible light absorption, and the CsBr/TiO2 thin film presents higher absorption than the PbBr2/TiO2 interface, which is attributed to the formation of interface states and the decreased interface bandgap. Furthermore, compared with the PbBr2/TiO2 interface, CsBr/TiO2 solar devices present larger output short circuit current and shorter photoluminescence decay time, which indicates that the CsBr contacting layer with TiO2 can better extract and separate the photo-induced carriers. The first-principles calculations confirm that, due to the existence of staggered gap (type II) offset junction and the interface states, the CsBr/TiO2 interface can more effectively separate the photo-induced carriers and thus drive the electron transfer from the CsPbBr3 perovskite layer to the TiO2 layer.

In situ compositional analysis and real-time film characterizations reveal that the decomposition of both mixed-halide perovskites starts at the grain boundaries, leading to the formation of hydrocarbons and ammonia gas with the residuals of PbI2(Cl), Pb, or PbClxBr2-x in the films. The degradation has been correlated to the localized trap states that induce strong coupling between photoexcited carriers and the crystal lattice.",,,,"Li, Yanqing/C-7262-2013; Bao, Qinye/A-5110-2013; Tang, Jianxin/A-1452-2013","Tang, Jian-Xin/0000-0002-6813-0448",,,,,,,,,,,,1944-8244,1944-8252,,,,21-Feb,2018,10,7,,,,,6737,6746,,10.1021/acsami.7b18389,,,,,,,,WOS:000426143900075,29389110,,,,

This imposes restrictions on being able to precisely tune the amount of reaction species and, consequently, on being able to regulate the composition of the final NCs. In order to overcome this issue, we show here that benzoyl halides can be efficiently used as halide sources to be injected in a solution of metal cations (mainly in the form of metal carboxylates) for the synthesis of APbX(3) NCs (in which A = Cs+, CH3NH3+, or CH(NH2)(2)(+)). In this way, it is possible to independently tune the amount of both cations and halide precursors in the synthesis. The APbX(3) NCs that were prepared with our protocol show excellent optical properties, such as high photoluminescence quantum yields, low amplified spontaneous emission thresholds, and enhanced stability in air. It is noteworthy that CsPbI3 NCs, which crystallize in the cubic a phase, are stable in air for weeks without any postsynthesis treatment.

To broaden the photoresponse of perovskite solar cells, we demonstrate an efficient perovskite/organic integrated solar cell containing both CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite and PBDTTT-E-T: IEICO organic photoactive layers. By integrating a low band gap PBDTTT-E-T: IEICO active layer on a perovskite layer, the maximum wavelength for light harvesting of the ISC increased to 930 nm, sharply increasing the utilization of near infrared radiation. In addition, the external quantum efficiency of the integrated device exceeded 50% in the near infrared range. The MAPbI(3)/PBDTTT-E-T: IEICO ISCs show an enhanced short-circuit current density of over 24 mA cm(-2), which is the highest existing value among perovskite/organic integrated solar cells and much higher than the traditional MAPbI(3) based perovskite solar cells.

Herein, the planar TiO2 electron transport layer (ETL) of perovskite solar cells is modified with ionic salt CuI via a simple one-step spin-coating process. The p-type nature of the CuI islands on the TiO2 surface leads to modification of the TiO2 band alignment, resulting in barrier-free contacts and increased open-circuit voltage. It is found that the polarity of the CuI-modified TiO2 surface can pull electrons to the interface between the perovskite and the TiO2, which improves electron extraction and reduces nonradiative recombination. The CuI solution concentration is varied to control the electron extraction of the modified TiO2 ETL, and the optimized device shows a high efficiency of 19.0%.

Dedicated electrically conductive diffusion barriers inside the cell stack, that counteract the ingress of moisture and prevent the migration of corrosive halogen species, can substantially improve ambient and thermal stability. Although atomic layer deposition (ALD) is excellently suited to prepare such functional layers, ALD suffers from the requirement of vacuum and only allows for a very limited throughput. Here, we demonstrate for the first time spatial ALD-grown SnOx at atmospheric pressure as impermeable electron extraction layers for perovskite solar cells.

The addition of g-C3N4 results in improved crystalline quality of perovskite film with large grain size by retarding the crystallization rate, and reduced intrinsic defect density by passivating charge recombination centers around the grain boundaries. In addition, g-C3N4 doping increases the film conductivity of perovskite layer, which is beneficial for charge transport in perovskite light-absorption layer. Consequently, a champion device with a maximum power conversion efficiency of 19.49% is approached owing to a remarkable improvement in fill factor from 0.65 to 0.74.

However, it is a highly nontrivial issue in translationally invariant systems since the time-reversal symmetry T plays an essential role, where the two states at crystal momenta k and -k are connected in the band structure. Therefore, it has been considered that the external magnetic field (B) or the magnetic order which breaks the T-symmetry is necessary to realize the nonreciprocal I-V characteristics, i.e., magnetochiral anisotropy. Here we theoretically show that the electron correlation in T-broken multi-band systems can induce nonreciprocal I-V characteristics without T-breaking. An analog of Onsager's relation shows that nonreciprocal current response without T -breaking generally requires two effects: dissipation and interactions. By using nonequilibrium Green's functions, we derive general formula of the nonreciprocal response for two-band systems with onsite interaction. The formula is applied to Rice-Mele model, a representative 1D model with inversion breaking, and some candidate materials are discussed. This finding offers a coherent understanding of the origin of nonreciprocal I-V characteristics, and will pave a way to design it.",,,,"Nagaosa, Naoto/G-7057-2012; Morimoto, Takahiro/L-9826-2018",,,,,,,,,,,,,2045-2322,,,,,14-Feb,2018,8,,,,,,,,2973,10.1038/s41598-018-20539-2,,,,,,,,WOS:000424985800011,29445217,,,,

Meanwhile, as a fast channel, the 1D PNWs would promote carrier transport from the bulk perovskite film to the electron transport layer. The PSCs with 1D PNW modification not only exhibit excellent photovoltaic performances, but also show good stability with only 4% PCE loss within 30 days in the ambient air without encapsulation. Our results strongly suggest that in-situ grown 1D PNW network provides a feasible and effective strategy for nanostructured optoelectronic devices such as PSCs to achieve superior performances.",,,,"yang, deren/J-3311-2012","yang, deren/0000-0002-1745-2105",,,,,,,,,,,,0957-4484,1361-6528,,,,9-Feb,2018,29,6,,,,,,,65401,10.1088/1361-6528/aaa054,,,,,,,,WOS:000419631200001,29219844,,,,

Based on this principle, it is proposed to constitute efficient Lewis acid-base adduct in the SnI2 deposition step to modulate its volume expansion and fast reaction with methylammonium iodide (MAI)/formamidinium iodide (FAI) (FAI is studied hereafter). Herein, trimethylamine (TMA) is employed as the additional Lewis base in the tin halide solution to form SnY2-TMA complexes (Y = I-, F-) in the first-step deposition, followed by intercalating with FAI to convert into FASnI. It is shown that TMA can facilitate homogeneous film formation of a SnI2 (+SnF2) layer by effectively forming intermediate SnY2-TMA complexes. Meanwhile, its relatively larger size and weaker affinity with SnI2 than FA+ ions will facilitate the intramolecular exchange with FA+ ions, thereby enabling the formation of dense and compact FASnI(3) film with large crystalline domain (>1 mu m).

As found in this study, the performance of MAPbI(3) (MA = CH3NH3) cells using spiro-OMeTAD as the hole transport material (HTM) deteriorated mainly not due to the degradation of the perovskite but because of the modification of the interface between the perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD at high temperature. In addition, the spiro-OMeTAD layer underwent a severe morphological deformation at high temperature, showing large voids in it, which reduced the cell performance further. However, despite the complete reconversion of PbI2 to perovskite and the replacement of the degraded spiro-OMeTAD film with a fresh layer in the MAPbI(3) cells, the cell performance was not recovered to the initial value because the modified perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface became worse after recycling. The thermal stability and performance recovery upon recycling were found to depend on the composition of the perovskite; faster degradation of MAPbI(3) cells with a slight excess of MAI and better stability of cells not containing MA (FA(0.85)Cs(0.15)PbI(3), FA = CH(NH2)(2)) indicated certain involvement of MA(+) ions in the alteration of the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface. Unlike the heat-treatment case, MAPbI(3) cells, when exposed to a humid environment, degraded significantly to PbI2 and the reconversion of this PbI2 to perovskite followed by deposition of a fresh spiro-OMeTAD layer increased the cell performance but it did not recover to the initial value.

Accordingly, it is proposed that the carbon electrodes are effective to extract photogenerated holes in MAPbBr(3) solar cells, and the industry-applicable carbon electrodes will not limit the performance of bromide-based perovskite solar cells. Based on the analysis of the band alignment, it is found that the voltage (energy) loss across the interface between MAPbBr(3) and carbon is very small compared to the offset between the valence band maximum of MAPbBr(3) and the work function of graphite. This finding implies either Fermi level pinning or highly doped region inside MAPbBr(3) layer exists. The band-edge electroluminescence spectra of MAPbBr(3) from the solar cells further support no back-transfer pathways of electrons across the MAPbBr(3)/TiO2 interface.",,,,"Sun, Licheng/A-7357-2017; Sun, Licheng/P-2657-2019",,,,,,,,,,,,,1614-6832,1614-6840,,,,5-Feb,2018,8,4,,,,,,,1701159,10.1002/aenm.201701159,,,,,,,,WOS:000424152200002,,,,,

Among the results, it is found that the application of only three minutes of the SVPT (for the ultrasonic vibration assembly used in this study, operated at 40 kHz) brings about significant improvement in the film coverage, and the contact between the perovskite and the m-TiO2 layers, owing to the effective penetration of the perovskite solution into the pores, leading to a superior charge transfer, and a significant increase in the device power conversion efficiency (PCE), when compared to the control device.

In this study, we incorporated carbon quantum dots (CQDs) in the perovskite films, and investigated their effects on the performance of TiO2 nanosheet-based and HTM-free PSCs. It was found that the addition of CQDs to the perovskite film can enhance the photocurrent density of PSCs, and the optimal PSC with 0.1% CQDs evolved 60% higher photocurrent density than the pristine one. The improved photocurrent density was attributed to the heterogeneous nuclei derived from CQDs during perovskite crystallization, which would increase amount of perovskite nuclei and form a fine perovskite grain, leading to a better coverage on the substrate. Moreover, due to the excellent conductivity, CQDs in perovskite films could efficiently transport the photo-excited electrons, accelerating the separation and mobilization of charge carriers.

We have studied by ab initio calculations, using several levels of approximation - namely density functional theory including spin-orbit coupling and quasi-particle corrections by means of the GW method, as well as pseudopotential self-interaction corrections, the role of the methylammonium orientation on the electronic structure of this perovskite. We have considered many molecular arrangements within 2 x 2 x 2 supercells, showing that the relative orientation of the organic molecules is responsible for a huge band gap variation up to 2 eV. The band gap sizes are related to distortions of the PbI3 cage, which are in turn due to electrostatic interactions between this inorganic frame and the molecules. The strong dependence of the band gap on the mutual molecular orientation is confirmed at all levels of approximations. Our results suggest then that the coupling between the molecular motion and the interactions of the molecules with the inorganic cage could help to explain the widening of the absorption spectrum of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite, consistent with the observed white spectrum.

The charges in two-dimensional (2D) materials are restricted in their movement to the two-dimensional plane; however, their confined structure allows one to tune the optical and electronic properties by varying their thickness. Here we focus on the main advantages of 2D halide perovskites including their enhanced stability; several recent reports discussing this point are summarized. It was observed that 2D perovskites exhibit enhanced moisture resistivity, starting from films to complete solar cells. The power conversion efficiency of photovoltaic solar cells based on 2D- and quasi-2D perovskites (2D + 3D perovskites) as light harvesters has been increasing but still not as much as 3D perovskites. However, their other advantages (e.g., stability, tuning of optical and electronic properties, and the large amount of possible organic cations that can be integrated into their structure) make them a stable alternative for efficient and large-scale module solar cells, which may constitute the next step for commercializing perovskite-based solar cells.

To improve the dispersion of graphene in ethanol, one possible strategy is to add different oxidizing agents to graphene. This leads to the formation of graphene dispersions in ethanol, and they have great stability. However, ultrasonication is required to bring about the synthesis of stable graphene dispersions in ethanol. In this paper, the surface-modified graphene was synthesized by two methods, which improved the dispersion of graphene in ethanol. In these methods, the modified graphene was incorporated into the carbon electrode in order to improve the conductivity of carbon electrode in perovskite solar cells. Thus, battery efficiency was improved significantly in solar cells by following this innovative strategy. We studied the conductivity effects of surface-modified graphene using different drying methods. Compared to the carbon electrode (without added graphene), the resistivity of grapheneincorporated carbon electrode significantly decreased from 1.130E-03 Omega.m to 8.429E-05 Omega.m when the carbon electrode was successfully subjected to carboxylation reaction; moreover, the resistivity of graphene-incorporated carbon electrode reduced to 1.163E-04 Omega.m when the electrode was successfully subjected to hydroxylation reaction. The value of R-Ct decreased sharply when we add modified graphene. The results indicate that when carbon electrode incorporated modified graphene, the resistivity became low and the electron transport properties of the electrode improved sharply.

The solar cell preparation protocols have been optimized to reach power conversion efficiencies higher than 17%. The impedance response has been investigated both under light and in the dark to discriminate the light sensitive parameters. The spectra have been carefully analyzed using an ad hoc equivalent circuit, and the data have been discussed in the light of the existing literature. The spectra showed no intermediate frequency inductive loop due to the absence of multistep charge transfer involving surface states. A large inductive loop is found to be the signature of poorly functioning solar cells. Except for the high frequency capacitance, which is the bulk response of perovskite, the other parameters are influenced by interface and contact phenomena, ionic conductivity and charge accumulations. The scaling of the low frequency capacitance with the hysteresis amplitude is clearly stated by our comprehensive study.

Nanocrystals of Cs2AgBiI6, synthesized via a novel anion-exchange. protocol using trimethylsilyl iodide, have strong absorption throughout the visible region, confirming theoretical predictions that this material could be a promising photovoltaic absorber.

However, the morphology of perovskite film fabricated through two-step sequential deposition method usually suffers from poor film coverage and low crystallinity due to the ungovernable crystallization kinetics. Moreover, owing to the compact stacking of PbI2 crystals, the conversion of PbI2 is incomplete as well. In this work, we propose for the first time to control the nanostructure of PbI2 to get high crystallinity, identical (100) crystal orientation and PbI2 residue-free film. Porous PbI2 with plate structure was obtained by selected solvent annealing (SSA). The reaction rate between PbI2 and methylammonium iodide (MAI) was accelerated because the contact area between PbI2 and MAI was enlarged due to the porous nanostructure of PbI2. Thus, uniform, high crystalline perovskite film without PbI2 residue was obtained. Furthermore, (100) crystal orientation of perovskite was obtained due to the PbI2 shape changing from grain to plate, which originated from the changing growth frontier of PbI2 crystals. As a result, a promising power conversion efficiency of 16.61% is achieved in planar-heterojunction PVSCs due to improved photoabsorption and carrier extraction efficiency.

Yet, no direct evidence of polarons or other low-energy states have been reported despite extensive efforts. Such states should manifest as below bandgap features in transient absorption and photoluminescence measurements. Here,. we use single-particle transient absorption microscopy on MAPbI(3) (MA = methylammonium) to unambiguously identify spectrally narrow sub-bandgap states directly; we demonstrate that such signals are completely averaged away in ensemble measurements. Carrier temperature-dependent studies suggest that hot carriers are directed toward transient low-energy states which are immune from permanent defects and traps, thereby giving rise to low carrier recombination rates and ultimately high power conversion efficiency in devices. The utilization of short:lived sub-bandgap states Maybe a key design principle that propels-widespread use of highly heterogeneous material's in optoelectronic applications.",,,,"Stoumpos, Constantinos/P-6677-2016","Stoumpos, Constantinos/0000-0001-8396-9578; Harel, Elad/0000-0003-3007-0993; Jiang, Xinyi/0000-0002-7446-8621",,,,,,,,,,,,1530-6984,1530-6992,,,,FEB,2018,18,2,,,,,827,831,,10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b04078,,,,,,,,WOS:000425559700025,29381866,,,,

However, the long-term stability of MAPbI(3)-based solar cells has yet to be achieved. Besides the well-known chemical and thermal instabilities, significant native ion migration in lead halide perovskites leads to current-voltage hysteresis and photoinduced phase segregation. Recently, it is further revealed that, despite having excellent chemical stability, the Au electrode can cause serious solar cell degradation due to Au diffusion into MAPbI(3). In addition to Au, many other metals have been used as electrodes in MAPbI(3) solar cells. However, how the external metal impurities introduced by electrodes affect the long-term stability of MAPbI(3) solar cells has rarely been studied. A comprehensive study of formation energetics and diffusion dynamics of a number of noble and transition metal impurities (Au, Ag, Cu, Cr, Mo, W, Co, Ni, Pd) in MAPbI(3) based on first-principles calculations is reported herein. The results uncover important general trends of impurity formation and diffusion in MAPbI(3) and provide useful guidance for identifying the optimal metal electrodes that do not introduce electrically active impurity defects in MAPbI(3) while having low resistivities and suitable work functions for carrier extraction.",,,,"Du, Mao-Hua/B-2108-2010; Zhang, Lijun/F-7710-2011","Du, Mao-Hua/0000-0001-8796-167X; Zhang, Lijun/0000-0002-6438-5486",,,,,,,,,,,,2198-3844,,,,,FEB,2018,5,2,,,,,,,1700662,10.1002/advs.201700662,,,,,,,,WOS:000426200000032,29610728,,,,
