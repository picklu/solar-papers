This still young generation of solar cells is currently rivalling, in PCEs, well-established technologies, such as cadmium telluride (CdTe) and silicon. Further improvements in device stability by means of innovative materials are yet to come, with technology becoming closer to meeting the market requirements. Emerging from this groundbreaking discovery, a great number of charge transporting materials have flourished, which is particularly true for hole transporting materials (HTMs). The huge number of molecules prepared stem from design and engineering of a wide variety of new and also chemically modified old molecules where organic synthesis has played a fundamental role. In this review, the contribution of chemistry through those synthetic protocols used for producing new and innovative HTMs from relatively simple organic molecules is presented in a rational and systematic manner.

For inorganic halide perovskites we find that the bonding within the inorganic framework is mainly responsible for their elastic behavior.

For example, the orientationally-averaged Young's modulus of orthorhombic MAPbI(3) increases by about 19% compared to the equivalent inorganic series of structures. We also find that, within the carrier-acoustic phonon scattering regime, the electron and hole carrier mobilities of hybrid halide perovskites are lowered by the hydrogen-bonding-induced tilting of the inorganic octahedra.

However, models that describe the impact of pinholes on solar cell performance are scarce. Here, we demonstrate that certain combinations of contact layers suppress the negative impact of pinholes better than others. The absence of the absorber at a pinhole gives way to a direct electrical contact between the two semiconducting electron and hole transport layers. The key to understand how pinholes impact the solar cell performance is the resulting nonlinear diodelike behavior of the current across the interface between these two layers (commonly referred to as a shunt current). Based on experimentally obtained data that mimic the current-voltage characteristics across these interfaces, we develop a simple model to predict pinhole-induced solar cell performance deterioration. We investigate typical contact layer combinations such as TiO2/spiro-OMeTAD, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate)/phenyl-C-61-butyric acid methyl ester, and TiO2/poly(3-hexylthiophene). Our results directly apply to perovskite and other emerging inorganic thin-film solar cells, and the methodology is transferable to CIGS and CdTe. We find substantial differences between five commonly applied contact layer combinations and conclude that it is not sufficient to optimize the contact layers of any real-world thin-film solar cell only with regard to the applied absorber. Instead, in the context of laboratory and industrial fabrication, the tolerance against pinholes (i.e., the mitigation of shunt losses via existing pinholes) needs to be considered as an additional, important objective.",,,,"Rau, Uwe/G-2256-2011; Kirchartz, Thomas/G-7687-2014","Rau, Uwe/0000-0003-3526-3081; Kirchartz, Thomas/0000-0002-6954-8213; Liu, Zhifa/0000-0003-1068-4867",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-7447,,,,,6-Dec,2018,122,48,,,,,27263,27272,,10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b09400,,,,,,,,WOS:000452693300017,,,,,

Detailed steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence studies have been carried out to understand charge transfer dynamics in the CsPbBr3/ZnO nanostructure composite system. Femtosecond transient absorption and broadband dielectric spectroscopy studies were carried out to determine the charge carrier relaxation and transfer mechanism. The redox energy-level diagram suggests that the photoexcited electron from the conduction band (CB) of CPB can be transferred to the CB of ZnO NP because of thermodynamic viability. Ultrafast studies reveal that the electron transfer takes place from the perovskite nanostructures to ZnO NP within similar to 500 fs and limits the recombination process by efficient charge separation and charge accumulation at the interfaces. Dielectric studies also reveal reduced charge leakage in composite nanostructures with efficient charge separation by facilitating the charge accumulation at the interfaces.

Current research and production trends aim at increasing the efficiency, and reducing the cost, of industrial modules. In this paper, we review the main concepts and theoretical approaches that allow calculating the efficiency limits of c-Si solar cells as a function of silicon thickness. For a given material quality, the optimal thickness is determined by a trade-off between the competing needs of high optical absorption (requiring a thicker absorbing layer) and of efficient carrier collection (best achieved by a thin silicon layer). The efficiency limits can be calculated by solving the transport equations in the assumption of optimal (Lambertian) light trapping, which can be achieved by inserting proper photonic structures in the solar cell architecture. The effects of extrinsic (bulk and surface) recombinations on the conversion efficiency are discussed.

However, the stability and performance reproducibility of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) needs to be further improved to match that of silicon photovoltaic devices before they can be commercialized. One of the major bottlenecks that hinders the improvement of device stability/reproducibility is the additives in the hole-transport layer, lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP). Despite the positive effects of these hole-transport layer additives, LiTFSI is hygroscopic and can adsorb moisture to accelerate the perovskite decomposition. On the other hand, tBP, the only liquid component in PSCs, which evaporates easily, is corrosive to perovskite materials. Since 2012, the empirical molar ratio 6:1 tBP:LiTFSI has been wildly applied in PSCs without further concerns. In this study, the formation of tBP-LiTFSI complexes at various molar ratios has been discovered and investigated thoroughly. These complexes in PSCs can alleviate the negative effects (decomposition and corrosion) of individual components tBP and LiTFSI while maintaining their positive effects on perovskite materials. Consequently, a minor change in tBP:LiTFSI ratio results in huge influences on the stability of perovskite. Due to the existence of uncomplexed tBP in the 6:1 tBP:LiTFSI mixture, this empirical tBP-LiTFSI molar ratio has been demonstrated not as the ideal ratio in PSCs. Instead, the 4:1 tBP:LiTFSI mixture, in which all components are complexed, shows all positive effects of the hole-transport layer components with dramatically reduced negative effects. It minimizes the hygroscopicity of LiTFSI, while lowering the evaporation speed and corrosive effect of tBP. As a result, the PSCs fabricated with this tBP:LiTFSI ratio have the highest average device efficiency and obviously decreased efficiency variation with enhanced device stability, which is proposed as the golden ratio in PSCs. Our understanding of interactions between hole-transport layer additives and perovskite on a molecular level shows the pathway to further improve the PSCs' stability and performance reproducibility to make them a step closer to large-scale manufacturing.",,,,,"Wang, Shen/0000-0003-3826-4397; Xiong, Wei/0000-0002-7702-0187; Meng, Ying Shirley/0000-0001-8936-8845",,,,,,,,,,,,0002-7863,,,,,5-Dec,2018,140,48,,,,,16720,16730,,10.1021/jacs.8b09809,,,,,,,,WOS:000452693800046,30400739,,,,

Herein, an efficient Vis-NIR perovskite photodetector (PePD) created by doping PbS quantum dots (QDs) in perovskite precursors via an antisolvent additive solution process is reported. By changing the volume of the antisolvent additive, perovskite hybrid films of MAPbI(3): PbS QDs with good crystallinity and uniform grain size are created. The resultant Vis-NIR PePD exhibits a specific detectivity of 10(12) and 10(11) Jones in the visible and NIR regions, respectively.

Probing this intrinsic instability is one of the major milestones and challenging tasks toward enhancing the lifespan of the material. Here we have incorporated Cs ions into methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)) films and studied the thin film structural and optical properties. Incorporation of Cs into MAPbI(3) leads to formation of both alpha-CsPbI3 and partial derivative-CsPbI3 phases, black and yellow, respectively, as indicated by the evolution of the optical band edge and X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum. At a concentration of 20% Cs ions, we observe the existence of a stable alpha-CsPbI3 phase. Incorporating 59% or more Cs ions yields the yellow phase of CsPbI3, due to alloying of Cs with the MAPbI(3) matrix. The structural transformations observed in absorption spectra and XRD are confirmed by low-frequency Raman spectroscopy. The thermally induced structural fluctuations in pure MAPbI(3) films are damped upon Cs incorporation, thus bringing long-range stabilized order to the perovskite structure and enabling for the first time observation of low-frequency Raman scattering at room temperature for OHPs. In addition to this, Cs incorporation rigidizes the perovskite film and sharpens all low-frequency vibrational peaks.

Films with small grains show mostly random grain orientation angles, whereas films with large grains are oriented with {100} planes around an angle of 20 degrees relative to the surface normal.

One promising material is cuprous iodide, CuI, thin films of which have hole mobilities in the 1-12 cm(2)/V.s range. However, despite adequate electrical properties in many CuI thin films, most deposition processes afford only rough films that have poor continuity and low optical transparency, hampering the final device performance. We now report an all-vapor method, amenable to large-scale processing, for preparation of CuI thin films with near record optical and electrical properties. In this process, thin films of Cu(2-x)S (x = 0-0.1) or Cu2O grown by chemical vapor deposition from bis(N,N'-di-sec-butylacetamidinato)dicopper(I) in combination with hydrogen sulfide or water, respectively, were converted to gamma-CuI upon exposure to dilute hydrogen iodide vapor. The rate of this iodide-for-chalcogenide anion exchange reaction is controlled by the concentration and delivery rate of HI. The nucleation rate of the nascent CuI may be modified by dosing with iodine vapor (for Cu(2-x)S) or with vapors of thiodiglycol or ethylene glycol (for Cu2O). By balancing the rates of nucleation and conversion, we are able to prepare smooth, continuous thin films possessing optical and electrical properties approaching those of the best native p-type CuI films. We believe that the underlying chemical and materials science reasoning leading to these high-quality films will prove instructive in other thin-film systems.

Effective light management is however crucial to minimize reflection or parasitic absorption losses in either the top cell or in the light in-coupling of the transmitted light to the bottom sub-cell. The study here is focused on calculating an optimum performance of a four-terminal mechanically stacked tandem structure by varying the optical property and thickness of the spacer between top and bottom sub-cells. The impact of the nature of the spacer material, with its refractive index and absorption coefficient, as well as the thickness of that layer is used as variables in the optical simulation. The optical simulation is done by using the transfer matrix-method (TMM) on a stack of a semi-transparent perovskite solar cell (top cell) mounted on top of a cSi interdigitated back contact (IBC) solar cell (bottom cell). Two types of perovskite absorber material are considered, with very similar optical properties. The total internal and external short circuit current (J(sc)) losses for the semitransparent perovskite top cell as a function of the different optical spacers (material and thickness) are calculated. While selecting the optical spacer materials, J(sc) for both silicon (bottom cell) and perovskite (top cell) were considered with the aim to optimize the stack for maximum overall short circuit current. From these simulations, it was found that this optimum in our four-terminal tandem occurred at a thickness of the optical spacer of 160 nm for a material with refractive index n = 1.25. At this optimum, with a combination of selected semi-transparent perovskite top cell, the simulated maximum overall short circuit current (J(sc-combined, max)) equals to 34.31 mA/cm(2). As a result, the four-terminal perovskite/cSi multi-junction solar cell exhibits a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.26%, as the sum of the perovskite top cell PCE = 16.50% and the bottom IBC cSi cell PCE = 8.75%. This accounts for an improvement of more than 2% absolute when compared to the stand-alone IBC cSi solar cell with 23.2% efficiency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1996-1944,,,,,DEC,2018,11,12,,,,,,,2570,10.3390/ma11122570,,,,,,,,WOS:000456419200228,30562986,,,,

The evolution of the V-oc overshoot was systematically investigated along with the intensity and the width of the light pulse, the background illumination, and pretreatment by different bias. Based on the experimental results, we could conclude that the V-oc overshoot originated from carrier motion against carrier collection direction, which happened at the ionic-accumulation- induced band bending areas near the interfaces between the perovskite active layer and the two carrier transport layers. The investigation on the V-oc overshoot can help us to better understand ionic migration, carrier accumulation, and recombination of PSCs under open-circuit conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1996-1944,,,,,DEC,2018,11,12,,,,,,,2407,10.3390/ma11122407,,,,,,,,WOS:000456419200065,30501019,,,,

HTMs play a vital role in PSCs as they can enhance the performance of a device by reducing charge recombination processes.

We find that the polyvinyl butyral (PVB) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) additives can both obviously enhance the quality of the perovskite films compared with the pristine one. Especially, the perovskite film with PVB additive shows clearer improved quality because of the formation of larger crystal grains which can go from bottom to top and smoother surface with the lower root-mean-square roughness of 23.4 nm than that of the one with PVA additive (45.6 nm). The improved quality of the perovskite films with PVB additive contributes to better photovoltaic performance and long-term stability of the devices. The PSCs with PVB additive can achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.10% and a small hysteresis index of 0.039, which are both better than those of the pristine ones (15.14% and 0.148, respectively). Furthermore, the PSC with PVB additive can maintain a relatively high PCE of 12.43% after being stored in a humid ambient air condition without any encapsulation, whereas the pristine one drops to a very low PCE of 5.18%.

The emergence of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with smart processing ability play an ever-growing role in online condition monitoring of machines. WSNs are cost-effective networking systems for machine condition monitoring. It avoids cable usage and eases system deployment in industry, which leads to significant savings. Powering the nodes is one of the major challenges for a true WSN system, especially when positioned at inaccessible or dangerous locations and in harsh environments. Promising energy harvesting technologies have attracted the attention of engineers because they convert microwatt or milliwatt level power from the environment to implement maintenance-free machine condition monitoring systems with WSNs. The motivation of this review is to investigate the energy sources, stimulate the application of energy harvesting based WSNs, and evaluate the improvement of energy harvesting systems for mechanical condition monitoring. This paper overviews the principles of a number of energy harvesting technologies applicable to industrial machines by investigating the power consumption of WSNs and the potential energy sources in mechanical systems. Many models or prototypes with different features are reviewed, especially in the mechanical field.

They are CdTe, Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)(2) (CIGS), and metal halide perovskite (PSC), each named after the light-absorbing semiconductor material. Thin-film solar cells and modules require very little active material due to their very high absorption coefficient. Efficient production methods with low materials waste, moderate temperatures, attractive cost structures, and favorable energy pay-back times will play a strong role in market development as thin-film technologies reach full maturity, including mass production and the standardization of production machineries. In fact, the first two technologies have already been developed up to the industrial scale with a market share of several GW.

A large number of laboratories are experimenting through a wide range of options in order to optimize not only the efficiency but also stability, environmental aspects, and manufacturability of PSC.

In this paper, polymer-wrapped single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) films embedded in an insulating poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix and capped by a thermally evaporated Au electrode are investigated as a composite hole transport layer and optical spacer. Employing transient absorption spectroscopy we show that the SWNTs enhance the charge transfer rate from CQD to CQD, ZnO, or SWNT.

Measuring the external quantum efficiency and absorption we find that the improvement is not mainly from electronic improvements but from enhanced absorption of the CQD absorber. We demonstrate experimentally and theoretically, by employing a transfer-matrix model, that the transparent PMMA matrix acts as an optical spacer, which leads to an enhanced absorption in the absorber layer.

While the beneficial effects of partial ionic replacement at the A- and X-sites are largely demonstrated, partial replacement of Pb2+ is less explored. Here, we developed a solution-based procedure to prepare thin films of mixed-metal MAPb(1-a)Mn(a)I(3) perovskites. Although Mn2+ ions have a size that can potentially fit in the B-sites of MAPbI(3), using a combination of structural and chemical analysis, we show that only less than 10% of Pb2+ can be replaced by Mn2+. A 3% replacement of Pb2+ by Mn2+ leads to an elongation of the charge carrier lifetimes as concluded from time-resolved PL measurements. However, by analysis of the time-resolved microwave conductance data, we show that the charge carrier mobilities are largely unbalanced, which is in accordance with density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicating that the effective mass of the hole is much higher than that of the electron. Increasing the concentration of Mn2+ in the precursor solution above 10% results in formation of amorphous Mn-rich domains in the film, while the perovskite lattice becomes depleted of Mn2+. These domains negatively affect the charge carrier mobilities and shorten the lifetime of photogenerated carriers. The resulting reduction in charge carrier diffusion lengths will severely limit the photovoltaic properties of solar cells prepared from these mixed metal halide perovskites.

Herein, we first demonstrate a thick TiO2 backbone film directly on top of a perovskite film through a simple room-temperature solution process. Through the strategy of decorating the TiO2 film with fullerene for passivating traps and filling voids, we achieve a fullerene-decorated TiO2 electron transport layer (ETL) in inverted PVSCs. Because of the suppressed monomolecular Shockley-Read-Hall recombination and ion diffusion of the fullerene-decorated TiO2 ETL, stabilized efficiencies of similar to 20% and shelf life stability remaining over 98% of initial efficiency after aging in ambient conditions or 16 months are achieved. Remarkably, the PVSCs are insensitive to TiO2 thickness from 50 to 250 nm, which contributes significantly to the robust fabrication and high reproducibility of the PVSCs.

We find a reversible decrease of the absorber bandgap of up to 70 meV in complete solar cells. In situ X-ray diffraction measurements under illumination and bias confirm structural changes of the perovskite and their reversibility, which are attributed to a segregation of the halides.

It is shown that pure oxygen exposure reduces the typically observed pronounced n-type surface character, while pure water exposure increases it. Very low water partial pressure, e.g., as encountered in inert-gas glove boxes and in high vacuum of 10(-6) mbar, reduces the perovskite work function due to water physisorption, which is fully reversible upon mild annealing (room temperature to 50 degrees C) in ultrahigh vacuum. Upon exposure to ambient air, the effect of oxygen prevails over that of water, and the perovskite become less n-type as seen by a 0.6 eV Fermi level shift toward midgap.

According to the WKb approximation, the tunneling probability of a carrier through a quantum well increased by four orders of magnitude because of the smaller layer thickness, which was confirmed by XRD (the layer spacing decreased to 9.08 angstrom of MA(2)PbI(4) from 13.39 angstrom of BA(2)PbI(4)). In addition, theoretical calculations and experimental analysis reveal that the MA(2)PbI(4) perovskite possesses a narrow band gap, good conductivity, and a low trap density. As a result, the PCE of the 2D PSCs reached 16.92%, and the certified efficiency was 16.6% according to the National Institute of Metrology (NIM), the highest efficiency value so far for 2D PSCs. Furthermore, the MA(2)PbI(4) devices exhibited superior long-term stability under illumination and exposure to environmental conditions. The PCEs of the 2D perovskite devices without encapsulation degraded by only 2.2% from their initial values when exposed to ambient conditions at similar to 55% relative humidity for 1512 hours. Meanwhile, the efficiency remained 97.2% of its initial value when the device was continuously illuminated for 500 hours at 60 degrees C in argon. Even after following the illumination test with light-soaking for over 500 h in ambient air, the PCE of the unsealed device suffered only a minor degradation of 3.8%.",,,,,"Priya, Shashank/0000-0003-1367-3434",,,,,,,,,,,,1754-5692,1754-5706,,,,1-Dec,2018,11,12,,,,,3349,3357,,10.1039/c8ee02284d,,,,,,,,WOS:000452317700003,,,,,

Textured silicon wafers can be utilized for light management, however, this is typically not compatible with perovskite solution processing. Here, we instead employ a textured light management (LM) foil on the front-side of a tandem solar cell processed on a wafer with a planar front-side and textured back-side. This way the PCE of monolithic, 2-terminal perovskite/silicon-heterojunction tandem solar cells is significantly improved from 23.4% to 25.5%. Furthermore, we validate an advanced numerical model for our fabricated device and use it to optically optimize a number of device designs with textures at different interfaces with respect to the PCE and energy yield. These simulations predict a slightly lower optimal bandgap of the perovskite top cell in a textured device as compared to a flat one and demonstrate strong interdependency between the bandgap and the texture position in the monolithic stack. We estimate the PCE potential for the best performing both-side textured device to be 32.5% for a perovskite bandgap of 1.66 eV. Furthermore, the results show that under perpendicular illumination conditions, for optimized designs, the LM foil on top of the cell performs only slightly better than a flat anti-reflective coating. However, under diffuse illumination, the benefits of the LM foil are much greater. Finally, we calculate the energy yield for the different device designs, based on true weather data for three different locations throughout the year, taking direct as well as diffuse illumination fully into account. The results further confirm the benefits of front-side texture, even more for BIPV applications. Overall, devices built on a both-side textured silicon wafer perform best.

It is common knowledge that imposing a low frequency vertical vibration (similar to 1-10 (2) Hz) on a liquid body or layer results in bulk oscillation of the liquid and creation of standing surface waves with a frequency comparable to the excitation frequency (harmonic and subharmonic Faraday waves). Our experiments showed that the response of a liquid layer excited by horizontal and vertical ultrasonic frequency (20-68 kHz) is quite different, hypothetically because of a huge difference and mismatch between the characteristic times of vibration (small) and momentum diffusion (large) at high excitation frequencies. We observed that an excitation frequency of the order of 10(4) Hz results in the formation of traveling waves with frequencies of the order of 10(2) Hz, i.e. much smaller than the excitation frequency. In addition, we measured the speed of the Marangoni flow on the surface of a liquid film. We found that imposing ultrasonic vibration did not affect the speed of the Marangoni flow, corroborating that the ultrasonic vibration-induced traveling waves do not cause a bulk translational motion, and thus the flow on the surface is potential, whereas adjacent to the substrate a boundary layer forms.

The UV-Vis spectrum proves that the co-doped samples possess higher light scattering intensity than the un-doped samples, which may contribute to improve the short current density of PSCs.

GQDs are considered new kind of quantum dots (QDs), as they are chemically and physically stable because of its intrinsic inert carbon property. Furthermore, GQDs are environmentally friendly due to its non-toxic and biologically inert properties, which have attracted worldwide interests from academic and industry. In this review, a number of GQDs preparation methods, such as hydrothermal method, microwave-assisted hydrothermal method, soft-template method, liquid exfoliation method, metal-catalyzed method and electron beam lithography method etc., are summarized. Their structural, morphological, chemical composition, optical, electrical and optoelectrical properties have been characterized and studied. A variety of elemental dopant, such as nitrogen, sulphur, chlorine, fluorine and potassium etc., have been doped into GQDs to diversify the functions of the material. The control of its size and shape has been realized by means of preparation parameters, such as synthesis temperature, growth time, source concentration and catalyst etc. As far as energy level engineering is concerned, the elemental doping has shown an introduction of energy level in GQDs which may tune the optical, electrical and optoelectrical properties of the GQDs. The applications of GQDs in biological imaging, optoelectrical detectors, solar cells, light emitting diodes, fluorescent agent, photocatalysis, and lithium ion battery are described. GQD composites, having optimized contents and properties, are also discussed to extend the applications of GQDs.

This article reports the effect of photogenerated dipoles in the electron transport layer (ETL) on the photovoltaic actions in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). A nonfullerene material ITIC with optically induced dipoles was doped into PCBM acting as ETL in inverted planar structure PSCs (ITO/PEDOT: PSS/MAPbI(3-x)Cl(x)/ETL/PEI/Ag). The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs increases from 13.48% to 14.52% with introducing ITIC into ETL. The capacitance measurements indicate that optically induced dipoles can decrease interfacial charge accumulation. Furthermore, impedance spectroscopy suggests the charge recombination as well as ionic migration are reduced with ITIC doped ETL.

Herein, the processing windows of perovskite films prepared by one-step and two-step processes have been investigated. We find that both perovskite films prepared by one-step and two-step methods in air are much rougher than that prepared in glovebox. For the one-step method, complete perovskite conversion can be readily achieved both in air and in glovebox, but totally different in surface morphology. For the two-step method, residual PbI2 are remained in perovskite film, particularly with larger amount for the film prepared in air. Both rough surface and incomplete conversion hinder the realization of high quality perovskite film in air. The photovoltaic performances of the PVSCs prepared by one-step and two-step methods in glovebox are systematically compared. The generally observed lower photovoltaic performance of two-step PVSCs is ascribed to the additional trap-assisted recombination process due to larger trap density in the two-step perovskite film. This is confirmed by carrier recombination study using steady state photoluminescence, transient photovoltage and photocurrent measurements. Finally, combining the high work function hole transporting material poly-TPD, and the high-quality onestep perovskite film, a 17.5% high-efficiency PVSCs can be achieved.

The treatment of perovskite layer results in reduction of impurity phases of 8-FAPbI(3) and Pbl(2). Photoluminescence and open circuit voltage decay data demonstrate better charge carrier collection by the C-60/BCP compared to the PC70BM ETL, and an electron barrier for the back flow of electrons from ETL to perovskite. Our improvements in perovskite crystalization and electron transfer layer simultaneously lead to increasing the current density from 10 to 21 mA cm(-2).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0378-7753,1873-2755,,,,30-Nov,2018,405,,,,,,70,79,,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.09.100,,,,,,,,WOS:000451102500009,,,,,

Experimental measurements show quenching of the photoluminescence (PL) signal from the perovskite layer when it is capped with a hole transport medium (HTM). Furthermore, time-resolved PL (TRPL) data show a faster decay of the PL signal in the presence of the perovskite/HTM interface. The experimental decay is usually fitted using one or two exponential functions with an incomplete physical picture. In this work, an extensive model is used to extract the key physical parameters characterizing carrier dynamics in the bulk and at the interfaces. The decay of the TRPL signal is calculated in the presence of both defect-assisted recombination (Shockley Read Hall) and band-to-band radiative recombination where carrier extraction/recombination at the interfaces is described by interface recombination velocities. By proper curve fitting of the modeling results and the measured TRPL signal, meaningful optoelectronic parameters governing photophysical processes in mixed halide perovskite thin films and single crystals are extracted. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis to assess the contribution of these parameters on TRPL kinetics is also performed.

However, for possible commercialisation, long-term stability remains a key obstacle, especially when compared to silicon or GaAs. Thus, future research will significantly focus on stability. The most relevant industry standards for the stability of solar cells are issued by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), summarized in the so-called IEC 61215 norm. The IEC 61215 is a series of very detailed, time-consuming and interconnected stress tests that provide accelerated aging conditions to extrapolate the potential longterm lifetime of a solar module. Established silicon, for example, passes the full IEC 61215. To gain the confidence of investors and customers, passing the full IEC 61215 is a necessary minimum requirement for the commercialization of perovskites. Interestingly, the IEC 61215 is not openly accessible which may be one reason why there are often references to outdated versions. To remedy this situation, we introduce and analyse the most current IEC 61215 stability standards for solar cells and to which degree perovskites have passed them. We then elaborate on the most pertinent challenges for the long-term stability of PSCs in the coming years. This includes less explored stability tests such as potential-induced degradation (IEC TS 62804-1) and ammonia corrosion (IEC 62716). From this, it is evident that currently underappreciated degradation modes such as mechanical stability, high applied voltages and reverse bias, where especially hot spots could become problematic, must be considered in the coming years when evaluating the long-term stability of PSCs.",,,,"Saliba, Michael/L-6581-2019","Saliba, Michael/0000-0002-6818-9781; Lab, Steiner/0000-0002-9834-2716",,,,,,,,,,,,2050-7488,2050-7496,,,,28-Nov,2018,6,44,,,,,21794,21808,,10.1039/c8ta06950f,,,,,,,,WOS:000456724800009,,,,,

In this study, a three-dimensional (3D) rutile TiO2 nanodendrite array (RTNDA) film containing 1D trunks and branches was fabricated through second hydrothermal treatment of 1D rutile TiO2 nanorod array (RTNRA) film hydrothermally grown on a fluorine tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass. The resulting 3D-RTNDA film not only facilitates close contact with mixed-ion perovskite (Cs-0.05(FA(0.83)MA(0.17))(0.95)Pb(I0.9Br0.1)(3)) film, but also promotes the formation of a perovskite layer with larger crystal grain sizes. Both can efficiently retard the interface charge recombination, and thus result in a significantly improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.0%, improved by 20% as compared to that (15.0%) of the device fabricated with the 1D-RTNRA film. Spectroscopic, electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements indicate that the improved photovolatic performance can be mainly ascribed to the largely suppressed hysteresis effect, the increased open-circuit voltage and fill factor stemming from the more effective hole blocking and electron transport.

In this work, we used p-benzoquinone (p-BQ) to generate surface defects on methylammonium lead triiodide perovskite (MAPbI(3)), and found that a Usanovich acid-base (O-2, acetone or acetonitrile) treatment can effectively passivate those defects and lead to photoluminescence (PL) enhancement. The passivation effect arose from partial neutralization of defect charges via electron transfer between passivation reagents and relevant defects. O-2 accepted photo-generated electrons, formed negatively charged oxygen species and attached to the I vacancy site to reduce its PL quenching efficiency by neutralising the defects positive charge. Likewise, acetone accepted photo-generated holes, formed positively charged species and partially neutralised the defects negative charge. The reduced trapping ability of defects caused PL enhancement. In addition, the observed photo-catalysed oxidation of acetone by O-2 on the crystal surface supported the single electron transfer mechanism, and showed the potential of MAPbI(3) as a photo-catalyst.",,,,"Tian, Yuxi/B-7147-2014","Tian, Yuxi/0000-0002-5910-1514",,,,,,,,,,,,1463-9076,1463-9084,,,,28-Nov,2018,20,44,,,,,28068,28074,,10.1039/c8cp06112b,,,,,,,,WOS:000450660400035,30383047,,,,

Although MGs have been studied for over 80 years their ability to control the morphology and optoelectronic properties of composite films containing photoactive materials is in its infancy. Solution processable hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites such as CH3NH3PbI3-zClz have attracted enormous fundamental and applied interest because of their outstanding optoelectronic properties. There is considerable interest in establishing methods to control perovskite film morphology, for example, using micropatterning. Here, hydrophilic poly(N-vinylformamide)-based MGs were dispersed in perovskite precursor solution which was then spin coated to deposit CH3NH3PbI3-zClz/MG films for the first time. Remarkably, the CH3NH3PbI3-zClz/MG composites formed disordered inverse opal (DIO) films. The CH3NH3PbI3-zClz/MG composition ranges which gave DIO films are identified using a phase diagram. The pore wall thickness is shown to be controlled by the volume fraction of MGs used and a simple model is presented to explain this behaviour. The MGs not only caused CH3NH3PbI3-zClz to be more efficiently deposited but also increased light absorption and photoluminescence intensity. Demonstration solar cells constructed containing the DIO CH3NH3PbI3-zClz/MG films had an average conversion efficiency of 6.58 +/- 0.81%. A mechanism for DIO film formation is discussed.

Improvements in both fronts have happened concurrently and are responsible for these rapid efficiency gains. Here, the authors review the recent advances in understanding the role of ESLs on performance improvements. ESLs can be prepared from either organic and inorganic semiconductors, or a combination of both, and their key characteristics are summarized in detail.

While TiO2 shows excellent performance in the short term, it has also been shown to induce solar cell degradation due to its UV absorption properties.

Traditional electronic materials including metals and semiconductors usually have poor mechanical flexibility and very limited elasticity. Three main strategies are adopted for the development of flexible/stretchable electronic materials. One is to use organic or polymeric materials. These materials are flexible, and their elasticity can be improved through chemical modification or composition formation with plasticizers or elastomers. Another strategy is to exploit nanometer-scale materials. Many inorganic materials in nanometer sizes can have high flexibility.

In this work, the limitations of a solution-processed fullerene layer have been identified as high crystallinity and the presence of remnant solvents, in contrast to a thermally deposited C-60 film, which has low crystallinity and no remaining solvents. As a solution to these problems, a mixed C-60 and C-70 solution-processed film, which exhibits low crystallinity, is proposed as an electron-transporting layer. The mixed-fullerene-based devices produce power conversion efficiencies as high as that of the thermally evaporated C-60-based device (16.7%) owing to improved fill factor and open-circuit voltage. In addition, by vacuum-drying the mixed fullerene film, the power conversion efficiency of the solution-processed perovskite solar cells is further improved to 18.0%. This improvement originates from the enhanced transmittance and charge transport by removing the solvent effect. This simple and low-cost method can be easily used in any type of solar cells with fullerene as the electron-transporting layer.",,,,"XIANG, Rong/B-2589-2008; Matsuo, Yutaka/C-9897-2011; Maruyama, Shigeo/B-1848-2008; Manzhos, Sergei/B-1304-2009","XIANG, Rong/0000-0002-4775-4948; Matsuo, Yutaka/0000-0001-9084-9670; Maruyama, Shigeo/0000-0003-3694-3070; Manzhos, Sergei/0000-0001-8172-7903",,,,,,,,,,,,1944-8244,,,,,21-Nov,2018,10,46,,,,,39590,39598,,10.1021/acsami.8b11049,,,,,,,,WOS:000451496000021,30259726,,,,

The OV concentration is increased by substituting an aliovalent cation Ca2+ at Bi3+ sites in the BFO structure. Furthermore, the OV concentration at the disordered grain boundaries can be increased by reducing the particle size. Photoconductivity studies carried out on spark plasma sintered Bi(1-)xCa(x)FeO(3-delta) ceramics show four orders of enhancement for x = 0.1. Temperature dependent Nyquist plots depict a clear decrease in impedance with increasing Ca2+ concentration which signifies the role of OV. A significant reduction in photoconductivity by 2 to 4 orders and a large increase in impedance of the air-annealed (AA) nanocrystalline ceramics suggest that O-V at the grain boundaries primarily control the photocurrent. In fact, activation energy for AA samples (0.5 to 1.4 eV) is larger than the as-prepared (AP) samples (0.1 to 0.5 eV). Therefore, the room temperature J-V characteristics under 1 sun illumination show 2-4 orders more current density for AP samples. Density-functional calculations reveal that, while the defect states due to bulk OV are nearly flat, degenerate, and discrete, the defect states due to surface OV are non-degenerate and interact with the surface dangling states to become dispersive. With large vacancy concentration, they form a defect band that enables a continuous transition of charge carriers leading to significant enhancement in the photoconductivity. These studies reveal the importance of tailoring the microstructural features as well as the composition-tailored properties to achieve large short circuit current in perovskite oxide based solar cells.

This, however, is not accounted for in most of the perovskite device models, as they are based on an effective-medium formulation for the mesoporous absorber layer, and the details of its underlying morphology are ignored. The mesoporous absorber layer is treated as a two-phase model that describes intrinsic solar cell physics such as free charge carrier generation, carrier transport, and recombination within the two phases, as well as at the interface between the two phases. We derive a spatially smoothed device model for meso-structured PSCs based on volume-averaging of electric potential and electron and hole concentrations of the two-phase model, and this spatially smoothed formulation captures two essential morphological descriptors that are not found in existing effective-medium formulations for meso-structured PSCs, namely, surface-to-volume ratio and porosity inside the mesoporous layer.

Using ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, we demonstrate that charge recombination in perovskites is extremely sensitive to the charge state of the halogen vacancy. A missing iodine anion in MAPbI(3) has almost no effect on charge losses. However, when the vacancy is reduced, the recombination is accelerated by up to 2 orders of magnitude. The acceleration occurs due to formation of a deep hole trap in the singly reduced vacancy, and both deep and shallow hole traps for the doubly reduced vacancy. The shallow hole involves a significant rearrangement of the Pb-I lattice, leading to a new chemical species: a Pb-Pb dimer bound by the vacancy charge, and under-coordinated iodine bonds. Hole trapping by the singly reduced iodide vacancy operates parallel to recombination of free electron and hole, accelerating charge losses by a factor of S. The doubly reduced vacancy acts by a sequential mechanism-free hole, to shallow trap, to deep trap, to free electron, and accelerates the recombination by a factor of 50. The study demonstrates that iodine anion vacancy can be beneficial to the performance, because it causes minor changes to the charge carrier lifetime, while increasing charge carrier concentration.

Our results show that, adding an oxygen-bridge between the neighboring phenyl groups of TPA side arms makes the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels up-shift, whereas the carbon-carbon single bond stabilizes the HOMOs by about 0.3-0.4 eV. By structural tailoring of the TPA side arms, the HOMO levels of newly designed molecules range from -5.08 eV to -5.61 eV, which provides more possibilities for the interfacial energy regulation. Meanwhile, our results also indicate that the quasi-planar molecular architecture and the delocalized frontier molecular orbitals can effectively enhance the electronic coupling between adjacent molecules. In addition, the reorganization energies are distinctly lowered in the cases of the mixed carbon-carbon bond and oxygen-bridge, and the double oxygen-bridge models. As a result, these molecules with the additional carbon-carbon bond and oxygen-bridge exhibit high hole mobilities. Several promising candidates are proposed toward more efficient PSCs, and more importantly, this work offers some new insights for the design of organic small molecule materials.",,,,,"Sun, Zhu-Zhu/0000-0003-3082-4222",,,,,,,,,,,,2040-3364,2040-3372,,,,21-Nov,2018,10,43,,,,,20329,20338,,10.1039/c8nr04730h,,,,,,,,WOS:000451762800027,30375622,,,,

Using pulsed laser deposition, highly conductive (0.014 cm) ZnO source and drain electrodes were fabricated allowing for the investigation of the interfacial charge transfer properties through current-voltage characteristics of a ZnO/perovskite/ZnO FET. With a bottom-contact FET device, gate voltage dependent current hysteresis in the drain current-gate voltage curves was probed at low temperature to minimize the effect of ion migration on electronic charge transport in the perovskite layer. Under illumination, importantly, ZnO/perovskite electrical contact properties were significantly altered due to electronic energy barrier change at the interface arising from the detrapping of electrons from the ZnO/perovskite interface, resulting in an enhanced dark current and a suppressed photocurrent. The origin of current hysteresis in the ZnO/perovskite/ZnO FET device is discussed relating it to interfacial charging/discharging associated with ultraviolet (UV)-induced oxygen adsorption/desorption. The results presented herein demonstrate that interfacial electronic properties at the donor (perovskite)/acceptor (ZnO) interface can be altered by photoinduced carrier trapping/detrapping, providing insights that UV-induced persistent photoconduction in transition metal oxide electron transport layers including ZnO may be contributing to the current hysteresis observed in the perovskite photovoltaic devices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2040-3364,2040-3372,,,,21-Nov,2018,10,43,,,,,20377,20383,,10.1039/c8nr06820h,,,,,,,,WOS:000451762800032,30376018,,,,

However, due to the high interfacial resistance and the low energy level matching between perovskite and carbon electrodes, the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) is less than that of the metal-based perovskite solar cells. In this paper, a carbon-based perovskite solar cell is fabricated with the device structure of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/Carbon. The perovskite films and carbon based perovskite solar cells are characterized by scanning electron microscope, atomic force microscope, X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Vis absorption spectrum, the steady-state spectrum, the time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectrum, and an electrochemical workstation. In addition, the internal mechanism of the efficiency improvement of carbon-based perovskite solar cell is discussed in depth. Then, the rotation speeds of mesoporous TiO2 layer (TiO2 paste diluted by ethanol with mass ratio of 1 : 4) are 1500, 1600, 1700 and 1800 r/min and the speeds of perovskite layer (CH3NH3I and PbI2 at a 1 : 1 molar ratio are stirred in a mixture of DMF and DMSO (9 : 1, v/v)) are 2000, 3000, 4000 and 5000 r/min; When the speed of m-TiO2 layer is 1700 r/min and the speed of perovskite layer is 4000 r/min, the mesoporous TiO2 layer thickness is about 500 nm, Thickness of CH3NH3PbI3 capping layer is about 400 nm. The cooperation of these two layers eventually leads to the high-quality perovskite with enlarged grain size, prolonged photoluminescence lifetime, lowered defect density, increased carrier concentration, and the finally enhanced photovoltaic performance. The device obtains the highest PCE of 11.11% with an open circuit voltage (V-o(c)) of 0.93 V, a current density (J(sc)) of 21.75 mA/cm(2) and fill factor (FF) of 55%. At the same time, the stability of the carbon-based perovskite solar cell is also studied. The XRD is used for initial perovskite and the perovskite after 15 days to investigate the photo- and humidity stability of the full cells without encapsulation. The device exhibits excellent air stability with only 5% degradation when aged in ambient air at room temperature with 40%-50% humidity without any encapsulation after 15 days, which is better than the metal based perovskite solar cell.

Many efforts have been made by choosing appropriate additives to improve the power conversion efficiency and the stability. In this work, guanidine thiocyanate as the additive is introduced into the lead precursor solution to prepare perovskite films via two-step solution method. It is found that guanidine thiocyanate additive can notably improve the power conversion efficiency and the stability of MAPbI(3) perovskite solar cells due to the improvement of quality and crystal structure of perovskite films. After adding guanidine thiocyanate into lead precursor to prepare perovskite films, the high power conversion efficiency of solar cell is increased from 15.24% to 16.92%. The improvement mechanisms of power conversion efficiency and thermal stability of perovskite solar cells have been studied. Thiocyanate ion additive largely affects the immediate nucleation process of perovskite film in which provides the improved morphology of the perovskite film, while thiocyanate ions are absent from the resulting perovskite film. However, guanidine ion can substitute methylammonium ion in lattices of perovskite. The guanidine-ion additive is mainly responsible for the improvement of thermal stability of perovskite film and can increase the power conversion efficiency of solar cells. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Electron-phonon coupling plays a critical role in all optoelectronic devices, and although the lattice dynamics and phonon frequencies of HOIPs have been well studied, little attention has been given to phonon lifetimes. We report high-precision momentum-resolved measurements of acoustic phonon lifetimes in the hybrid perovskite methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI), using inelastic neutron spectroscopy to provide high-energy resolution and fully deuterated single crystals to reduce incoherent scattering from hydrogen. Our measurements reveal extremely short lifetimes on the order of picoseconds, corresponding to nanometer mean free paths and demonstrating that acoustic phonons are unable to dissipate heat efficiently. Lattice-dynamics calculations using ab initio third-order perturbation theory indicate that the short lifetimes stem from strong three-phonon interactions and a high density of low-energy optical phonon modes related to the degrees of freedom of the organic cation. Such short lifetimes have significant implications for electron-phonon coupling in MAPI and other HOIPs, with direct impacts on optoelectronic devices both in the cooling of hot carriers and in the transport and recombination of band edge carriers.

Understanding the microscopic origins of high ionic conductivities has been complicated by indirect measurements and sample microstructural heterogeneities. Here, we report the direct visualization of halide anion interdiffusion in CsPbCl3-CsPbBr3 single crystalline perovskite nanowire heterojunctions using wide-field and confocal photoluminescence measurements. The combination of nanoscale imaging techniques with these single crystalline materials allows us to measure intrinsic anionic lattice diffusivities, free from complications of micro-scale inhomogeneity. Halide diffusivities were found to be between 10(-13) and similar to 10(-12) cm(2)/second at about 100 degrees C, which are several orders of magnitudes lower than those reported in polycrystalline thin films. Spatially resolved photoluminescence lifetimes and surface potential measurements provide evidence of the central role of halide vacancies in facilitating ionic diffusion. Vacancy formation free energies computed from molecular simulation are small due to the easily deformable perovskite lattice, accounting for the high equilibrium vacancy concentration. Furthermore, molecular simulations suggest that ionic motion is facilitated by low-frequency lattice modes, resulting in low activation barriers for vacancy-mediated transport.

A series of C-dots functionalized with hydrogen, hydroxyl (-OH), and carboxyl (-COOH) groups are considered in this study for their hole-transporting properties. The results reveal that simple hexagonal structured C-dots including -OH and -COOH group substituted C-dots have suitable valance band maximum (VBM) positions, which are suitable for hole transport.

This implies that tuning the band position is possible so that these two-dimensional C-dots could, in principle, be used for other solar-cell applications that may require different band positions for optimal performance. As a representative example, we studied the perovskite/C-Dot interface of two different possible surfaces (i. e.

This approach represents a way to effectively increase the absorber thickness while tackling the limited MAI diffusion in the compact PbI2 film via a two-step deposition method. The efficiency of flexible PSCs is improved from 14.2 to 15.8% with multistage deposition. Furthermore, the use of an amorphous transparent conductive oxide (TCO), InZnO, enhances the mechanical resistance against bending with respect to conventional crystalline TCO-based flexible devices. Near-infrared transparent flexible PSCs are developed with an efficiency of 14.0% and average transmittance of similar to 74% between 800 and 1000 nm. Flexible perovskite/CIGS thin-film tandem devices are demonstrated with an efficiency of 19.6% measured in the four-terminal configuration.",,,,"Carron, Romain/R-6717-2017","Carron, Romain/0000-0001-8281-4881; Feurer, Thomas/0000-0002-0281-0176",,,,,,,,,,,,1884-4049,1884-4057,,,,16-Nov,2018,10,,,,,,,,,10.1038/s41427-018-0099-1,,,,,,,,WOS:000454244700001,,,,,

For instance, hybrid perovskites are well-known to suffer from moisture instability which leads to surface degradation. Nonetheless, the dependence of the surface effect on the moisture stability and optoelectronic properties of hybrid perovskites has not been fully investigated. In this work, the influence of the surface effect of 2D layered perovskites before and after mechanical exfoliation, representing rough and smooth surfaces of perovskite crystals, are studied. It is found that the smooth 2D perovskite is less sensitive to ambient moisture and exhibits a considerably low dark current, which outperforms the rough perovskites by 23.6 times in terms of photodetectivity. The superior moisture stability of the smooth perovskites over the rough perovskites is demonstrated. Additionally, ethanolamine is employed as an organic linker of the 2D layered perovskite, which further improves the moisture stability.

In the present work, an alternative route was proposed and it was evaluated. In conventional fabrication route, carbon paste is coated on two-step deposited perovskite layer, but in proposed alternative route, carbon paste is first deposited on PbI2 layer and then CH3NH3I solution is infiltrated through it to convert PbI2 to perovskite. PSCs fabricated by conventional and alternative routes, using a carbon paste which didn't contain CB nanoparticles, showed average eta of 4.3% +/- 1.0% and 7.7% +/- 1.6%, respectively.

By eliminating the two requirements, the deposition of perovskite films both at room temperature and under ambient air condition will make the scalable roll-to-roll fabrication scheme feasible.

In addition, graphene can extract deep-band hot carriers of perovskite within only, similar to 50 fs, several orders faster than hot carrier relaxation and cooling in perovskite itself, due to the unique Dirac linear band structure of graphene, indicating a potential high energy conversion efficiency exceeding the Shockley-Queisser limit.

The acidity of the environment and hence the extent of protonation of the TOPO molecules tune the reactivity of the PbX2 precursor, regulating the size of the nanocrystals. On the other hand, TOPO molecules are virtually absent from the surface of our nanocrystals, which are simply passivated by one type of ligand (e.g., Cs-oleate). Furthermore, our studies reveal that Cs-oleate is dynamically bound to the surface of the nanocrystals and that an optimal surface coverage is critical for achieving high photoluminescence quantum yield. Our scheme delivers NCs with a controlled size and shape: only cubes are formed, with no contamination with platelets, regardless of the reaction conditions that were tested. We attribute such a shape homogeneity to the absence of primary aliphatic amines in our reaction environment, since these are known to promote the formation of nanocrystals with sheet/platelet morphologies or layered phases under certain reaction conditions.

However, high inherent optical losses and high reactivity of noble metals with halides in perovskites are main limiting factors for this approach. Incidentally, low-loss and chemically inert resonant silicon NPs allow for light trapping and enhancement at nanoscale, being suitable for thin film photovoltaics. Here photocurrent and fill-factor (FF) enhancements in meso-superstructured perovskite solar cells, incorporating resonant silicon NPs between mesoporous TiO2 transport and active layers, are demonstrated. This results in a boost of device efficiency up to 18.8% and FF up to 79%, being a record among the previously reported values on NPs incorporation into CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite-based solar cells. Theoretical modeling and optical characterization reveal the significant role of Si NPs for increased light absorption in the active layer rather than for better charge separation.

In the UV-to-800-nm range, photodetectors based on the hierarchical MAPbI(3) NR arrays exhibit specific detectivities 18.1-23.7 times higher than those of photodetectors based on MAPbI(3) films due to the effective photon management and reduced charge trap states in the hierarchical MAPbI(3) NR arrays. The solution-processed hierarchical MAPbI(3) NRs can be fabricated on various substrates including ultrathin polyimide, which facilitates the development of flexible photodetectors with highly stable photoresponse under bending strain. Furthermore, the ferroelectricity and the highly anisotropic alignment of MAPbI(3) NR arrays allow multifunctional photodetectors capable of self-powered and polarization-sensitive light detection, respectively.

Intercalation of solvent molecules into the perovskite plays a crucial role in directing the final dimensionality/structure.

Upon UV excitation, the 1DN structure emits white light due to easily formed ""self-trapped"" excitons. 2DN perovskites show band edge blue emission (similar to 410 nm). Interestingly, Mn2+ incorporated 2DN perovskites show a highly red-shifted Mn2+ emission peak at similar to 670 nm.

In addition, 2D perovskites are synthesized with a simple fabrication process with potential low-cost and large-scale manufacture. Up until now, state-of-the-art simulations of the excitonic states have been limited to the study of bulk organic perovskites. The large number of atoms in the unit cell and the complex role of the organic molecules make inefficient the use of ab initio methods. In this work, we define a simplified crystal structure to calculate the optical properties of 2D perovskites, replacing the molecular cations with inorganic atoms. We can thus apply state-of-the-art, parameter-free and predictive ab initio methods like the GW method and the Bethe-Salpeter equation to obtain the excitonic states of a model 2D perovskite. We find that optical properties of 2D perovskites are strongly influenced by excitonic effects, with binding energies up to 600 meV.

During deposition, the perovskite precursor first forms intermediate phases when adding antisolvents, which transform into perovskite phases after annealing. However, the annealing temperature is usually as high as 100 degrees C, which is much higher than the glass-transition temperature of most polymer substrates. The key to a low annealing temperature is to control the intermediate phases. We demonstrate that only toluene (TL) drives the perovskite precursor into metastable phases while other antisolvents including chlorobenzene, ethyl acetate, and trichloromethane drive the perovskite precursor into supersaturation phases. The metastable zone is a region in which only grains grow and are involved in a further exothermic reaction to form perovskite, so TL ensures a large grain size of 480 nm and reduces the annealing temperature to as low as 80 degrees C. Through controlling the intermediate phases with TL, optimized efficiencies approach 18.42 and 16.89% for rigid and flexible planar perovskite solar cells, respectively. The flexible device treated by TL retains 85% of its initial efficiency over a period of 20 days of storage under ambient conditions.

Focusing on tetragonal MAPbI(3), we demonstrate that temperature has different effects on the organic and inorganic subsystems and leads to subtle structural changes, decreasing nonradiative electron hole recombination. First, charge-phonon interactions are decreased because the libration dynamics of the organic component at higher temperature reduces the oscillation amplitude of the Pb-I lattice that supports electrons and holes. Second, thermal disorder localizes wave functions, reducing the nonadiabatic charge phonon coupling. Third, tilting of the inorganic octahedra increases the bandgap, extending charge carrier lifetime further.

In fact, the perovskite photoactive layer needs to work synergistically with the other functional components of the cell, such as charge transporting/active buffer layers and electrodes. In this context, graphene and related two-dimensional materials (GRMs) are promising candidates to tune ""on demand"" the interface properties of PSCs. In this work, we fully exploit the potential of GRMs by controlling the optoelectronic properties of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) hybrids both as hole transport layer (HTL) and active buffer layer (ABL) in mesoscopic methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) perovskite (MAPbI(3))-based PSCs. We show that zero-dimensional MoS2 quantum dots (MoS2 QDs), derived by liquid phase exfoliated MoS2 flakes, provide both hole-extraction and electron-blocking properties. In fact, on one hand, intrinsic n-type doping-induced intraband gap states effectively extract the holes through an electron injection mechanism. On the other hand, quantum confinement effects increase the optical band gap of MoS2 (from 1.4 eV for the flakes to >3.2 eV for QDs), raising the minimum energy of its conduction band (from -4.3 eV for the flakes to -2.2 eV for QDs) above the one of the conduction band of MAPbI(3) (between -3.7 and -4 eV) and hindering electron collection. The van der Waals hybridization of MoS2 QDs with functionalized reduced graphene oxide (f-RGO), obtained by chemical silanization-induced linkage between RGO and (3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane, is effective to homogenize the deposition of HTLs or ABLs onto the perovskite film, since the two-dimensional nature of RGO effectively plugs the pinholes of the MoS2 QD films. Our ""graphene interface engineering"" (GIE) strategy based on van der Waals MoS2 QD/graphene hybrids enables MAPbI(3)-based PSCs to achieve a PCE up to 20.12% (average PCE of 18.8%).

X-ray crystallographic analysis of organic single crystals and theoretical modeling on the microscopic hole transport paths have disclosed that with respect to AZ1 possessing one n-propyl lateral substituent, the AZ2 hole transporter with 4-methoxyphenyl is characteristic of a closer intermolecular packing owing to a less short-axis slipped cofacial it-stacking configuration, and a larger averaged domain of molecule aggregates, which jointly contribute to a higher thin film hole mobility. The AZ2-based PSC exhibits an excellent power conversion efficiency of 19.4%, which is even higher than that (19.1%) of the control cell based on the state of the art hole-transporter spiro-OMeTAD.

The interfacial energetics and optoelectronic properties of the perovskite layer grown on a nickel oxide (NiOx) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate hole injection interfaces are investigated. The better interface formed between the NiOx/perovskite layers in terms of lower density of traps/defects, as well as more balanced charge carriers in the perovskite layer leading to high recombination yield of carriers are the main reasons for significantly improved device efficiency, photostability of perovskite, and operational stability of PeLEDs.",,,,"Song, Myoung Hoon/F-3766-2010","Hamilton, Iain/0000-0002-0685-1696; Daboczi, Matyas/0000-0001-9920-3657",,,,,,,,,,,,2198-3844,,,,,NOV,2018,5,11,,,,,,,1801350,10.1002/advs.201801350,,,,,,,,WOS:000451173200029,30479940,,,,

The formation of methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) perovskite into mesoporous titania (TiO2) scaffold by a sequential deposition technique is known to offer better control over the perovskite morphology. The growth reactions at the mesoporous TiO2 film depend on reactants concentration in the host matrix and the reaction activation energy. Here, we are characterizing formation of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite in mimic solar cell photoelectrodes utilizing the developed NanoPlasmonic Sensing (NPS) approach. Based on dielectric changes at the TiO2 mesoporous film interface, the technique provides time-resolved spectral shifts of the localized surface plasmon resonance that varies widely depending on the different operating temperatures and methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) concentrations. Analytical studies included Ellipsometry, Scanning Electron Microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The results show that perovskite conversion can be obtained at lower CH3NH3I concentrations if reaction activation energy is lowered. A significant finding is that the NPS response at 350 nm mesoporous TiO2 can widely change from red shifts to blue shifts depending on extent of conversion and morphology of perovskite formed at given reaction conditions.

A zwitterionic compound, 3-(1-pyridinio)-1-propanesulfonate, is used to modify the SnO2 ETL. The zwitterion, which forms interfacial dipoles, plays a few important roles: (1) it causes shifts in the work function of SnO2 resulting in more efficient charge extraction and an increase in the built-in potential. (2) It pulls electrons from perovskite layers to the ETL/perovskite interface, enhancing the electron transport ability. (3) Interfacial dipoles prevent back transfer of electrons from the ETL to the perovskite and suppress charge recombination. (4) Positively charged atoms in the zwitterion passivate Pb-I antisite defects, improving the stability of devices. With these desirable properties, the PSC with doped Spiro-OMeTAD obtained a power conversion efficiency of 21.43%. In addition, the PSC with the dopant-free HTL exhibited a record high efficiency of 20.5% among dopant-free polymeric HTLs using green solvents.

To obtain different values of CBO, Magnesium doped zinc oxide (Zn1-xMgxO (ZMO)) thin films with a tunable conduction band energy level were employed as a model ESL in planar PSCs. We found that the charge recombination at the interface between the ESL and perovskite is strongly dependent on the CBO values: When the cliff structure is formed, i.e., when the conduction band minimum (CBM) of the ESL is lower than that of the perovskite, the interface recombination became dominant, and the open-circuit voltage (V-oc) worsened. When the spike structure is formed, i.e., when the CBM of the ESL is higher than that of the perovskite, the interfacial recombination is largely suppressed, which leads to an increased V-oc of the solar cells. Additionally, we found that an appropriate amount of Mg doping in ZnO to form ZMO reduced carrier concentration and improved carrier mobility, thereby enhancing the charge collection efficiency of the photoexcited electrons by the FTO electrode and, consequently, the short-circuit current density (J(sc)). Using transient absorption (TA) measurements, we have revealed for the first time that the electron injection from photoexcited MAPbI(3) to FTO through a ZMO compact layer occurs in the timescale of a few nanoseconds in planar PSCs.

Herein, we decorated the widely used HTL materials of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) through dispersing rubidium chloride (RbCl) in the aqueous solution. Based on systematic characterizations, we find that the RbCl dopant plays multiple roles in both the PEDOT:PSS-RbCl composite film and the interface between perovskite and HTL. RbCl could induce phase segregation of PEDOT:PSS and enlarge its nanocrystal size, which in turn to simultaneously enhance electrical conductivity, hole transport capability and work function without sacrificing optical transmittance of the HTL. In addition, RbCl crystallite possesses similar polyhedral structure and lattice parameters as the perovskite, which is beneficial for the seed-mediated growth of perovskite.

However, due to the fast crystallization kinetics, the perovskite film fabricated by solution-processing technique usually suffers from low crystallinity and poor orientation. Here, both the morphology and the ambient stability of perovskite films were improved through regulating crystallization rate and enhancing intermolecular interaction by adding alpha, omega-diamino poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG-NH2) into precursor solution (mixture of CH3NH3I and PbCl2). The PEG-NH2 and Pb2+ tended to form a new chelated compound Pb2+-PEG-NH2. The stable multidentate chelation between Pb2+ and PEG-NH2 retarded the crystal growth rate to half of the one of the film without PEG-NH2, which is determined by the in situ UV-vis absorption spectra and in situ two-dimensional detection capability. The slow crystallization process is beneficial for realizing an uniform perovskite film with enhanced crystallinity almost 3 times of the pristine film, and increased crystal size from smaller than 100 nm to larger than 300 nm. In addition, the content of perovskite crystals adopted (h 0 0) orientation increased from 9.59% to 20.70% due to the flexible PEG-NH2 chains. Moreover, the ambient stability of perovskite films was also enhanced because the Pb-halogen bond in perovskite crystals became stronger as well as the film became defect-free. As a result, the device fabricated with PEG-NH2 attained a high efficiency of 15.6% with remarkably prolonged ambient stability without encapsulation.

The photo-induced charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage (photo-CELIV) investigation and photocurrent density (J(ph)) versus effective voltage (V-eff) measurement indicate that FAPbI(3) PeSCs possess lower charge recombination and higher charge collection efficiency because of the superior transport property of FAPbI(3) perovskite, leading to higher internal quantum efficiency (IQE) than MAPbI(3) PeSCs.

Despite the great successes in the exceptional power conversion efficiency, many underlying mechanisms involving the structures and performance of the perovskite solar cells remain elusive, such as the role of the methylammonium cation and the optimization of the passivation technique. These hinder the formulation of a universal design principle that can guide us to rationally improve the perovskite solar cell performance. In addition, the notorious stability issue in perovskite solar cells prevents the solar cell from wide industrial application. In this manuscript, we closely examine the cation rotation and the passivating layer at the halide perovskite surface in the context of the stability issue. An experimentally-proved passivating agent iodopentafluorobenzene (IPFB) is used as an example. The ab initio investigation is performed via constraining/relaxing the cation rotation at the perovskite surface and manipulating the coverage of IPFB. Many existing reports tend to agree that the methylammonium cation rotation could be beneficial to the outstanding performance of the perovskite solar cell due to the ferroelectric effect. On the other hand, the passivating agents such as molecular additives tend to universally improve the device stability. In this study, our calculation suggests that: 1) the methylammonium cation rotation could undesirably accelerate the water infiltration process at the perovskite surface; 2) the passivating layer can counter-intuitively facilitate the water interaction with the perovskite surface; both of these could severely degrade the solar cell stability. Therefore, we emphasize on the double-edged sword effects of cation rotation and additive passivation on the stability of the perovskite solar cells. This study facilitates the convergence to the fundamental understanding of the organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells and is beneficial for the rational design of the halide perovskite-based optoelectronic devices.",,,,"Zhang, Lei/U-4622-2019","Zhang, Lei/0000-0001-6873-7314",,,,,,,,,,,,0927-0248,1879-3398,,,,NOV,2018,186,,,,,,349,355,,10.1016/j.solmat.2018.07.011,,,,,,,,WOS:000441491100042,,,,,

Possessing broad absorption spectrum, excellent photoluminescence quantum yields, large Stokes shifts between their absorption and emission bands and thus low self-absorption loss, high stability under illumination and oxygen exposure and tunable emission spectra, through halogen substitution, are advantages of organic inorganic hybrid perovskites as active media in luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs). In this work, Methylammonium Lead Halide Perovskites (CH3NH3PbX3, X = Cl, Br and I), are investigated as the active medium in planar and bulk form of LSCs. Using spectroscopic and photovoltaic measurements, variation of optical properties and device performance, with different halogen sources in the perovskite based LSC precursors, are monitored. Their superior performance is attributed to the high quantum yield of the Halide Perovskites. The obtained results reveal that to find a suitable condition for effective LSC, it is necessary to investigate the appropriate halogen atom in the synthesized perovskite, as well as the concentration of halide perovskite in LSC. It was found that CH3NH3PbCI3 perovskite, with 2.0 wt% perovskite concentration in Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA), leads to the highest efficiency, with the least dissipative effect in LSC.

Here, the authors use numerical modeling to rigorously analyze the impact of doping type, doping concentration, and device architecture on the efficiency of the c-Si bottom cell. We show that the use of low-resistivity p-type wafers can result in higher efficiencies than the currently favored n-type, moderate resistivity wafers, for both homo- and heterojunction bottom c-Si devices. Two new device structures - localized emitter rear localized (LERL) and reversed tunneling oxide passivating contact (rTOPCon) are proposed in order to further simplify cell fabrication and improve the device efficiency.

Our results indicate that the hot-carrier-induced deprotonation of MA(+) cations is the fundamental origin of the photodegradation, which inevitably leads to the release of volatile species such as ammonia (NH3), aminocarbyne fragments (CNH2), hydrogen (H-2), and iodine/hydrogen iodide (I/HI) from methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)) at different rates under simulated one sun solar illumination. Photodegradation processes can be mitigated by applying ultra-violet (UV) filters with suitable cutoff wavelengths to the light source. Additionally, we demonstrate that the incorporation of FA reduces the release of organic species but does not prevent the formation of I/HI. However, the addition of Cs effectively suppresses the release of all volatile gases.

M.",,,A fast and robust numerical scheme for solving models of charge carrier transport and ion vacancy motion in perovskite solar cells,APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING,,,,,,,,,,,,"Drift-diffusion models that account for the motion of ion vacancies and electronic charge carriers are important tools for explaining the behaviour, and guiding the development, of metal halide perovskite solar cells. Computing numerical solutions to such models in realistic parameter regimes, where the short Debye lengths give rise to boundary layers in which the solution varies extremely rapidly, is challenging. Two suitable numerical methods, that can effectively cope with the spatial stiffness inherent to such problems, are presented and contrasted (a finite element scheme and a finite difference scheme). Both schemes are based on an appropriate choice of non-uniform spatial grid that allows the solution to be computed accurately in the boundary layers. An adaptive time step is employed in order to combat a second source of stiffness, due to the disparity in timescales between the motion of the ion vacancies and electronic charge carriers. It is found that the finite element scheme provides significantly higher accuracy, in a given compute time, than both the finite difference scheme and some previously used alternatives (Chebfun and pdepe). An example transient sweep of a current-voltage curve for realistic parameter values can be computed using this finite element scheme in only a few seconds on a standard desktop computer.

A two-step spin process produced a mixed halide perovskite of CH3NH3PbI3-xClx and a mixture of PbCl2 and PbI2 was deposited on CdS, followed by a sub-sequential reaction with MAI (CH3NH3I). The added PbCl2 to PbI2 in the first spin-step affected the structure, orientation, and shape of lead halides, which varied depending on the content of Cl. A small amount of Cl enhanced the surface morphology and the preferred orientation of PbI2, which led to large and uniform grains of perovskite thin films. In contrast, the high content of Cl produces a new phase PbICl in addition to PbI2, which leads to the small and highly uniform grains of perovskites. An improved surface coverage of perovskite films with the large and uniform grains maximized the performance of perovskite solar cells at 0.1 molar ratio of PbCl2 to PbI2. The depth profiling of elements in both lead halide films and mixed halide perovskite films were measured by Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy, revealing the distribution of chlorine along with the thickness, and providing the basis for the mechanism for enhanced preferred orientation of lead halide and the microstructure of perovskites.

The addition of NiOx brings about high-quality crystals and convenient photo-generated charge transport with reduced defect density owing to efficient control of the preferred nucleation and crystal growth.

To eliminate the defects and enhance the photovoltaic properties of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), we designed a facile and effective method to repair the defects of the perovskite film using formamidinium iodine (FAI) solution. The dissociative FA(+) and I- ions could compensate for the loss of volatile organic cations and also fill the I- vacancies of halide perovskites. After repairing defects with proper concentration of FAI solution, the TRPL curves obtained by light exciting from the different sides of the perovskite film nearly overlap together, indicating the reduction of surface traps.

In addition to acting as matrices, MSt also functions as the ligand bound to the surface of CsPbX3 NCs, thereby eliminating the potential damage of NCs commonly encountered during purification as in copious past work. Quite intriguingly, the resulting CsPbX3-MSt nanocomposites display an outstanding suite of stabilities. First, they retain high emission in the presence of water because of the insolubility of MSt in water, signifying their excellent water stability. Second, anion exchange between CsPbBr3 MSt and CsPbI3 MSt nanocomposites is greatly suppressed. This can be ascribed to the efficient coating of MSt, thus effectively isolating the contact between CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 NCs, reflecting notable compositional stability. Third, remarkably, after being impregnated by MSt, the resulting CsPbI3 MSt nanocomposites sustain the cubic phase of CsPbI3 and high emission, manifesting the strikingly improved phase stability. Finally, phase segregation of CsPbBr1.5I1.5 NCs is arrested via the MSt encapsulation (i.e., no formation of the respective CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3), thus rendering pure and stable photoluminescence (i.e., demonstration of phase segregation stability). Notably, when assembled into typical white light-emitting diode architecture, CsPbBr1.5I1.5 MSt nanocomposites exhibit appealing performance, including a high color rendering index (R-a) and a low color temperature (T-c).
