Metal elemental doping is an effective solution to largely improve the property of oxide semiconductor thin film. In this study, zinc dopant is successfully inserted into TiO2 crystal lattice using low-temperature solution-processed route. We find that Zn-doped TiO2 films possess less trap-state density and better conductivity, compared to undoped thin films, which contributes to the promotion of short circuit current. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy displays inserting Zn2+ into TiO2 compact layer can lift up TiO2's Fermi level, which reasonably improved the carrier dissociation and transportation. Consequently, CH3NH3PbI3 PSCs based on 4.5% Zn-doped TiO2 has obtained 17.6% power conversion efficiency (PCE), which is nearly 27.5% higher than control device (13.8%). In addition, triple-cation mixed-halide PSCs based on 4.5% Zn-doped TiO2 has obtained a PCE of 19.04%, which is almost 13.7% higher than PCE of the device with undoped sample 16.75%.

The structural characterization of APbX(3) thin films using (scanning) transmission electron microscopy ((S)TEM) techniques can provide valuable information that can be used to understand and model their optoelectronic performance and device properties. However, since APbX(3) perovskites are soft materials, their characterization using (S)TEM is challenging. Here, we study and compare the structural properties of two different metal halide APbX(3) perovskite thin films: bulk CH3NH3PbI3 prepared by spin-coating of the precursors in solution and CsPbBr3 colloidal NPs synthetized and deposited by doctor blading. Both specimen preparation methods and working conditions for analysis by (S)TEM are properly optimized. We show that CH3NH3PbI3 thin films grown by a one-step method are composed of independent grains with random orientations. The growth method results in the formation of tetragonal perovskite thin films with good adherence to an underlying TiO2 layer, which is characterized by a photoluminescence (PL) emission band centered at 775 nm. The perovskite thin films based on CsPbBr3 colloidal NPs, which are used as the building blocks of the film, are preserved by the deposition process, even if small gaps are observed between adjacent NPs. The crystal structure of CsPbBr3 NPs is cubic, which is beneficial for optical properties due to its optimal band gap. The absorption and PL spectra measured in both the thin film and the colloidal solution of CsPbBr3 NPs are very similar, indicating a good homogeneity of the thin films and the absence of aggregation of NPs.

Herein, single-layered Cs4CuSb2Cl12 nanocrystals (NCs) with a narrow band gap of 1.6 eV were prepared for the first time via an ultrasonic exfoliation technique. This powerful top-down method was further generalized to synthesize a class of lead-free perovskite (Cs3Bi2X9 and Cs3Sb2X9) NCs. The experimental and theoretical studies revealed that not only inter-layer van der Waals forces but also in-plane chemical bonds played a critical role in the exfoliation process. Specifically, smaller uniform-sized NCs were observed for Cs4CuSb2Cl12 (approximate to 3 nm) as compared to those for Cs3Sb2Cl9 (approximate to 20 nm) although both Cs4CuSb2Cl12 and Cs3Sb2Cl9 exhibited a similar exfoliation energy (approximate to 0.310 J m(-2)). This can be ascribed to the weaker in-plane chemical bonds of Cu-Cl (2.808 angstrom) and Sb-Cl (2.924 angstrom) in Cs4CuSb2Cl12 than the uniform Cl-Sb bond (2.69 angstrom) in Cs3Sb2Cl9 that allow for an easier exfoliation process. In addition, exfoliation of the Cs4CuSb2Cl12 microcrystal into NCs results in an indirect-to-direct bandgap transition and a reduced electron effective mass, which provides a rapid and steady photoelectrochemical response, demonstrating that Cs4CuSb2Cl12 NCs are a promising candidate for optoelectronic applications.",,,,"Kuang, Dai-Bin/G-3444-2012; Miao, Naihua/J-2852-2013","Kuang, Dai-Bin/0000-0001-6773-2319; Miao, Naihua/0000-0002-5383-9008",,,,,,,,,,,,2040-3364,2040-3372,,,,28-Mar,2019,11,12,,,,,5180,5187,,10.1039/c9nr00375d,,,,,,,,WOS:000465361800005,30843576,,,,

Their nonpolar feature effectively promotes the crystallinity of the perovskite film grown on them; meanwhile, their unique partial biradical character seems to provide a certain degree of defect passivation function at the perovskite interface to facilitate interfacial charge transfer/extraction.

In this report, we use the change in fluorescence brightness to image the transformation of individual lead bromide (PbBr2) nanocrystals to methylammonium lead bromide (CH3NH3PbBr3) via intercalation of CH3NH3Br. Analyzing this reaction one nanocrystal at a time reveals information that is masked when the fluorescence intensity is averaged over many particles. Sharp rises in the intensity of single nanocrystals indicate they transform much faster than the time it takes for the ensemble average to transform. While the ensemble reaction rate increases with increasing CH3NH3Br concentration, the intensity rises for individual nanocrystals are insensitive to the CH3NH3Br concentration. To explain these observations, we propose a phase-transformation model in which the reconstructive transitions necessary to convert a PbBr2 nanocrystal into CH3NH3PbBr3 initially create a high energy barrier for ion intercalation. A critical point in the transformation occurs when the crystal adopts the perovskite phase, at which point the activation energy for further ion intercalation becomes progressively smaller. Monte Carlo simulations that incorporate this change in activation barrier into the likelihood of reaction events reproduce key experimental observations for the intensity trajectories of individual particles.

The N-H bend vibrational mode of CH3NH3+ organic cations is coupled to the inorganic perovskite lattice and provides a means to examine the structural fluctuations of the crystalline lattice of CH3NH3PbI3 films. In the excited electronic state, the photogeneration of charge carriers the N-H bend vibrational dephasing dynamics to become very sensitive to temperature, revealing large changes in the amplitude of the structural motions of the lattice within a narrow 150-300 K temperature range of the tetragonal phase. The larger amplitude fluctuations of the lattice at elevated temperatures inhibit delocalization of photogenerated charges, causing them to self-trap into large polarons with delocalization lengths that decrease more than 30% as the temperature increases from 150 to 300 K. This self-trapping into large polarons introduces energetic barriers that decrease the capture cross section for electron/hole recombination by an order of magnitude at elevated temperatures. These findings indicate that the slow charge recombination kinetics of halide perovskites underpinning many of their remarkable properties are traced to the formation of energetic barriers that hinder wavefunction overlap of oppositely charged carriers in large polaron states. The findings also suggest that substitution of differently sized ions in halide perovskites can be used to tune the balance of charge transport versus charge recombination for photovoltaic or light-emitting applications because ions influence the structural flexibility and therefore the self-trapping of charge carriers into large polarons.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-7447,,,,,28-Mar,2019,123,12,,,,,7061,7073,,10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b00555,,,,,,,,WOS:000463115500013,,,,,

So far, only two organic hole-transport materials have led to state-of-the-art performance in these solar cells(1): poly(triarylamine) (PTAA)(2-5) and 2,2',7,7'-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9'-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD)(6,7). However, these materials have several drawbacks in terms of commercialization, including high cost(8), the need for hygroscopic dopants that trigger degradation of the perovskite layer(9) and limitations in their deposition processes(10). Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is an alternative hole-transport material with excellent optoelectronic properties(11-13), low cost(8,14) and ease of fabrication(15-18), but so far the efficiencies of perovskite solar cells using P3HT have reached only around 16 per cent(19). Here we propose a device architecture for highly efficient perovskite solar cells that use P3HT as a hole-transport material without any dopants. A thin layer of wide-bandgap halide perovskite is formed on top of the narrow-bandgap light-absorbing layer by an in situ reaction of n-hexyl trimethyl ammonium bromide on the perovskite surface. Our device has a certified power conversion efficiency of 22.7 per cent with hysteresis of +/- 0.51 per cent; exhibits good stability at 85 per cent relative humidity without encapsulation; and upon encapsulation demonstrates long-term operational stability for 1,370 hours under 1-Sun illumination at room temperature, maintaining 95 per cent of the initial efficiency. We extend our platform to large-area modules (24.97 square centimetres)-which are fabricated using a scalable bar-coating method for the deposition of P3HT-and achieve a power conversion efficiency of 16.0 per cent.

Here, planar PSCs are fabricated by a synergistic effect of dimethyl sulfoxide additive and a dropwise addition method in a two-step deposition method. Under the optimizing procedure, a large-grain perovskite film with well-packed flat crystals is induced with a largest grain size of about 5 mu m, which reveals decreased defect states owing to reduced grain boundaries. Moreover, the film has a highly compact and flat surface, leading to high crystallinity, enhanced light absorption, and low carrier recombination rates. Corresponding PCE is significantly promoted to 20.63% from the original 16.02%. More importantly, the PSCs even without encapsulation exhibit excellent humidity stability, retaining 93% of its initial efficiency after 500 h in air with 40% humidity, whereas the pristine devices degrade by approximately 65% after only surviving for 256 h.

Here we demonstrate a kind of stable PSCs by using simple solution-process in an air enviroment with about 45% relative humidity. Firstly, the NH4Cl was added to the perovskite precursor solution to adjust the kinetics of crystallization and growth of active layer, and then obtain high-quality CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films. Hydrophobic carbon electrode was used to protect the perovskite active layers and further improve the stability of PSCs, which optimized the structure of the devices at the same time. We adjusted the amount of NH4Cl in the perovskite precursor solution (PbI2: CH3NH3I: NH4Cl = 1: 1: x (x = 0 similar to 1), and investigated the effect of that on the properties of perovskite active layers and PSCs.

GIXRD analysis evidenced that all three iodobismuthates investigated in thin films show mainly the horizontal (parallel to the substrate) orientation of the 1D polymeric Bi-I frameworks. Such arrangement blocks the charge transport in vertical direction (orthogonal to the substrate) since the conductive Bi-I chains are separated with insulating bulky organic cations.

Its aim is to pursue how to stabilize a flat surfaces structure (no vacancy) of the MAPbI(3) perovskite in overcoming its chemical instability. In this calculation, the (001) texture of the MAPbI(3) perovskite surface was modeled as a prototype. The 216-atom and 264-atom supercells were employed to imitate the Lead Iodide (PbI2)- and Methylammonium Iodine (MAI)terminated surfaces, respectively. It was found that doping of either Cl or Br atoms on perovskite surfaces enhances the energies required for releasing PbI2 and MAI molecules from the surfaces, causing vacancies on the surfaces. This is owed to the binding energies between the Cl and Br dopants and their surrounding atoms on the surfaces being stronger than those created by the Iodine atom. This implies that the formation of surface vacancies-which causes perovskite's degradation-can be prevented by Cl and Br surface doping.

We identify the existence of a capacitance of the order 10(-4) F.cm(-2) that is not discernible from IS measurements, which is attributed to the accumulation of anions at the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface, which also likely includes an electronic component. This interface is a dominant recombination pathway at lower voltages and can account for the large disparity in fill factors observed in PSCs. By developing detailed models for the IMPS response at both OC and short-circuit conditions, we also confirm that the arcs observed in the upper quadrant of the IMPS spectra are not related to transport times, as is commonly interpreted, but time constants results from the combination of the series resistance and capacitors within the circuit.

Distinguishing the effect of the formed electron and hole traps in the bulk and at surface/interfaces of the perovskite layer from their impact on the performance of the device can be beneficial in optimizing fabrication methods. Here, the transient AC and steady state DC measurements, and morphology characterizations confirm the variation of performance parameters with respect to grain boundaries growth. The device physics is uncovered with respect to the grain size (GS) of the perovskite layer employing the theoretical drift-diffusion framework incorporating the electronic and ionic contributions. The increase of open circuit voltage (V-oc) for devices with large GS can be associated to the density of defect states. The findings here suggest a more pronounced role of interfaces in efficiency enhancement of the PSCs with the emphasis on the impact of the hole transport layer (HTL)/perovskite layer interface which is also found to be accountable to the difference between the device internal voltage and the terminal voltage and minimizing this difference can lead to an enhancement of approximately 100 mV in V-oc. Additionally, the electron traps in the bulk of the perovskite layer play a distinguishable role in the reduction of V-oc for the device with the smallest GS. The ionic defect density is also estimated. Considering our results and previous reports, the performance of the PSC is remarkably dependent on the method of fabrication and the associated perovskite conversion mechanism, and not necessarily on GS. The results are expected to deliver important guidelines for the development of more efficient PSCs by further enhancement of the V-oc towards its thermodynamic limit of 1.32V, via creating optimal interfaces.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-3727,1361-6463,,,,20-Mar,2019,52,12,,,,,,,125501,10.1088/1361-6463/aafea9,,,,,,,,WOS:000456840100001,,,,,

The surface modification of TiO2 electron transport layers is an effective way to overcome the problem. Here, we report the successful fabrication of high efficiency and negligible hysteresis planar perovskite solar cells through modifying the TiO2 electron transport layers with p-type NiO nanocrystals. We find that the NiO nanocrystals form large numbers of NiO islands rather than homogeneous NiO films on the TiO2 electron transport layers. This special island-like morphology is propitious to maintain high light transmittance and induce large crystal grains and high crystallinity of perovskite layers. Furthermore, the device with NiO nanocrystals modification shows more effective electron extraction and lower charge accumulation than the pristine one. The champion device can achieve forward scanned and reverse-scanned efficiencies of 19.22% and 19.42%, respectively.

Often these studies make use of finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations in which high intensity coherent light is used, which simultaneously generates multiple plasmon excitations In the plasmonic nanostructures in agreement with the quantum mechanical view. However, because of the relatively small photon flux of real sun light, in the classical view only one plasmon excitation can be generated at a time in real plasmonic nanostructured devices. In this work we demonstrate that the use of high intensity coherent light in simulations causes significant optical absorption variations due to surface plasmon polariton (SPP) interference, depending on incident light phase difference between neighboring plasmonic nanostructures. Because this is not possible under real sun light conditions in the classical view, this could constrain such FDTD simulations. The question therefore arises if a quantum mechanical view is more appropriate. In this case study the plasmonic nanostructures are embedded in Perovskite, which has a strong optical absorption from silver surface plasmon polaritons and is therefore sensitive to SPP interference. This study raises the question whether to mimic real sun light, SPPs should be separately generated at each individual plasmonic nanostructure, or that the quantum mechanical view leads to a better agreement with the experimental solar cell.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0038-092X,,,,,15-Mar,2019,181,,,,,,452,455,,10.1016/j.solener.2019.02.021,,,,,,,,WOS:000463120700049,,,,,

Four diphenylamine derivatives with a fluorene core were synthesized and employed as hole transport layers in inverted p-i-n planar PSCs. HTMs that are endowed with vinyl crosslinking units can form insoluble 3D networks under mild annealing temperature, which improve the solvent resistance during the device fabrication and morphological stability. Moreover, the optimized devices incorporating crosslinked HTMs exhibit an impressive power conversion efficiency of 18.7% with a high J(sc) of 20.89 mA cm(-2), V-oc of 1.15 V and FF of 77.8%, which are superior to those of PEDOT:PSS based PSCs. The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy measurement justifies that the new HTMs feature deep HOMO levels aligning well with the perovskite. Moreover, the hydrophobic nature of the synthesized HTMs favors the formation of large grained and continuous perovskite films with good surface coverage, evidenced by the water contact angles and film morphology measurements.

Nevertheless, the photovoltaic performance of PSCs based on solution-processed NiO is still not pleasing owing to their relatively low short-circuit current density (J(sc)) or fill factor (FF), which originates from the relatively low conductivity of NiO and the enormous difference in the mobility of the electron transporting layer (ETL) fullerene and hole transporting layer (HTL) NiO. In this work, K is firstly introduced into NiO to improve its conductivity, carrier extraction capacity and mobility, and thus largely improve its J(sc) and FF. Consequently, a best PCE of 18.05% based on K-doped NiO is obtained, resulting in an increment of approximately 15% compared with 15.77% of the device based on pure NiO. The improved conductivity and mobility of NiO by extrinsic dopant K are believed to achieve charge-carrier transport balance from the perovskite to the ETL and HTL, which can effectively avoid charge accumulation within the perovskite or at the interface of the perovskite and HTL. Moreover, the partial diffusion of K induced a moderate excess of PbI2, thus forming type II band alignment between PbI2 and the perovskite, which can passivate the surface or grain boundaries of the perovskite. This work demonstrates that K-doped NiO is a promising HTM for highly efficient inverted PSCs.

First, the surface energies of seven low-index surfaces ((100), (010), (001), (110), (101), (011) and (111)) of orthorhombic MASnI(3) were calculated by density functional theory (DFT). The results showed the (011) surface was the most stable among the seven low index surfaces by the PW91 method. Secondly, three stable configurations were sorted out from these adsorption models of different molecules (H2O, O-2, N-2) at six positions on the (011) surface. For H2O, O-2 and N-2 adsorption, the smallest adsorption energies were -1.931(934) eV, -0.134(67) eV and -0.049(523) eV, respectively. The stabilities of configurations for H2O adsorption were affected by the strong interaction of the H-I bond. However, for O-2 adsorption, the Sn-O bond and charge transfer between the Sn atom and O atom mostly affected the stability of the configuration. We found that the MASnI(3) surface under a N-2 atmosphere maintained a higher stability than in the other two cases. In addition, we further confirmed that the mechanism of H2O adsorption was not the same as O-2 and N-2 molecular adsorption from the Mulliken population, energy band and electrical density of state calculations. These results indicated that the H-I bond and Sn-O bond mainly affect the Sn-I bond, leading to MASnI(3) stability being worse in H2O and O-2 environments, respectively, and performance in a N-2 environment is more stable than in O-2 and H2O environments.

The molecular orientation during the thermal conversion of NDI-Boc to NDI-H was examined using two-dimensional grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (2D-GIXD) and p-polarized multiple-angle incidence resolution spectrometry.

This performance enhancement can also be achieved by exposing these devices to high vacuum at ambient temperature. This study postulates that the performance increase stems from desorption of hydrogen from oxygen vacancies in SnO2.

It is concluded that high extrinsic electron concentrations in SnO2 are undesirable because of their role in non-radiative recombination. The reduction in electron density when SnO2 is incorporated into a perovskite diode is therefore advantageous for solar cell performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2196-7350,,,,,8-Mar,2019,6,5,,,,,,,1801788,10.1002/admi.201801788,,,,,,,,WOS:000460657100018,,,,,

The first-principle molecular dynamics simulations reveal substantial anharmonic fluctuations of the R-Ag Symbol of the Klingon Empire Br and R-Bi Symbol of the Klingon Empire Br at high temperatures. The synergy of anharmonic fluctuations and associated electron-phonon coupling, and the peculiar spin-orbit coupling effect, is responsible for the thermochromism. In addition, the intrinsic bandgap of Cs2AgBiBr6 shows negligible changes after repeated heating/cooling cycles under ambient conditions, indicating excellent thermal and environmental stability. This work demonstrates a stable thermochromic lead-free double perovskite that has great potential in the applications of smart windows and temperature sensors. Moreover, the findings on the structure modulation-induced bandgap narrowing of Cs2AgBiBr6 provide new insights for the further development of optoelectronic devices based on the lead-free halide double perovskites.",,,,"Abrikosov, Igor/I-7328-2013; Huang, Wei/A-4461-2009; Simak, Sergei/N-3205-2019; Wang, Feng/T-2610-2018; Simak, Sergei I./C-3030-2014","Huang, Wei/0000-0001-7004-6408; Simak, Sergei/0000-0002-1320-389X; Wang, Feng/0000-0002-0751-3672; Simak, Sergei I./0000-0002-1320-389X",,,,,,,,,,,,1616-301X,1616-3028,,,,7-Mar,2019,29,10,,,,,,,1807375,10.1002/adfm.201807375,,,,,,,,WOS:000460474200013,,,,,

However, the intermediate phase formation is often not uniform due to the uncontrolled solvent extraction, and finally effects the perovskite layer growth. Here, a solvent-vapor-assisted post treatment is developed to obtain a homogeneous perovskite intermediate phase after anti-solvent extraction. The homogenization of the intermediate phase renders the sole upward growth mechanism of perovskite crystals during heating, affording optimal alignment with few horizontal grain boundaries and large grains. These coarsened grains across the whole perovskite film facilitate efficient carrier transport and reduce charge recombination. As a result, the resulting planar perovskite solar cell (PeSC) has achieved a power conversion efficiency of 18.3%, compared to the as-prepared PeSC of 15.7%. Via solvent-vapor-assisted treatment, the operating time window of anti-solvent extraction was prolonged significantly, and correspondingly, a narrowed efficiency distribution was obtained. Thus, the influence of the operating time on the cell efficiency is released, effectively promoting the operability of practical applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Outstanding optoelectronic properties including high absorption coefficient, high mobility, and long diffusion length of charge carriers have been revealed in the family of hybrid organic inorganic halide perovskite materials that are considered the heart of solar cells. A long-anticipated feature for solar cells that the diffusion lengths of charge carriers outstrip the active layer thickness of a device has been demonstrated in PSCs so that the efficiency of extracting photocarriers, particularly electrons at the interfaces becomes a key parameter controlling global device performance. The n-type semiconductor TiO2 with the merits of thermal and chemical stability, low cost, and suitable band edge positions has been regarded an ideal electron transporting layer (ETL) material in PSCs performing the function of selectively extracting photoelectrons and subsequently delivering them toward a current collector. Besides the highly concerning energy conversion efficiency of PSCs, the challenge of the current-voltage hysteresis phenomenon and instability of PSCs are also revealed to be closely related with TiO2, ETLs. In this review, the recent progress on strategies for modifying TiO2 ETLs by controlling morphology, surface modification, doping, and constructing composites to improve global performance of PSCs is reviewed. Moreover, the perspective on future development of TiO2 based ETLs for high performance PSCs is proposed on the basis of the comprehensive and deep understanding of TiO2 from the area of photocatalysis.

Photon management allows for increasing the short-circuit current and energy conversion efficiency of perovskite single junction and perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells due to improved light incoupling and/or light trapping. In this study, an electrically flat but optically rough solar cell design is investigated, which combines the benefit of reaching high short-circuit currents, while maintaining the integrity of perovskite films processed on planar substrates or surfaces. Consequently, the perovskite films exhibit electrical properties comparable to planar perovskite solar cells, which allows for achieving solar cells with high open circuit voltage and fill factors. Electrically flat but optically rough perovskite solar cell structures can be successfully implemented because the perovskite material system and the contact materials of the solar cells exhibit comparable refractive indices. This sets the perovskite material system with its low refractive index apart from other high refractive index materials like silicon or germanium. Hence the proposed design of an electrically flat but optically rough solar cell cannot be applied to silicon or germanium solar cells. The design of perovskite single junction solar cells is discussed, and electrically flat but optically rough solar cells are compared to electrically and optically rough solar cells.

However, the toxicity and instability of best-in-class lead-halide perovskite materials make them nonideal. To combat these issues, we replaced lead with bismuth and explored the sensitivity of these new lead-free materials to the valency and bonding of their cationic organic groups. Specifically, we synthesized and characterized the materials properties and photophysical properties of hexane-1,6-diammonium bismuth pentaiodide ((HDA(2+))BiI5) and compared them to an analogue containing a more volatile organic group with half the number of carbon and nitrogen atoms in the form of n-propylammonium ((PA(+))(x)BiI3+x, where 1 < x < 3). The full crystallographic structures of (HDA(2+))BiI5 and (PA(+))(x)BiI3+x, were resolved by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. (HDA(2+))BiI5 was shown to be pure-phase and have a one-dimensional structure, whereas (PA(+))(x)BiI3+x was shown to be a mix of one-dimensional and zero-dimensional phases. Structures of the materials were confirmed by synchrotron X-ray diffraction of powders. Both (HDA(2+))BiI5 and (PA(+))(x)BiI3+x exhibit steady-state photoluminescence at room temperature. Density functional theory calculations of (HDA(2+))BiI5 predict electronic absorption features and a similar to 2 eV bandgap that are consistent with those observed experimentally. Structure-property relationships of the materials were examined, and moisture tolerance and film quality were found to be superior for dication-containing (HDA(2+))BiI5 in relation to monocation-containing (PA(+))(x)BiI3+x. We hypothesize that these trends are in part due to a molecular bridging effect enabled by the presence of the dicationic hexanediammonium groups in (HDA(2+))BiI5. Solar cells fabricated using (HDA(2+))BiI5 as the photoactive layer exhibited photovoltaic action while those containing (PA(+))(x)BiI3+x did not, suggesting that organic dicationic groups are beneficial to light-absorber morphology and ultimately solar-cell performance.",,,,"Scanlon, David/B-1516-2008","Scanlon, David/0000-0001-9174-8601",,,,,,,,,,,,2574-0962,,,,,MAR,2019,2,3,,,,,1579,1587,,10.1021/acsaem.8b01809,,,,,,,,WOS:000462944700001,,,,,

Additionally, the Na+ doping may increase the grain size and decrease the trap density. We recently reported a new 3-step method using additional spin-coating of a HC(NH2)(2)I (FAI) solution on a 2-step prepared CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI(3)) layer containing an unreacted PbI2, which produced a multiple bandgap structure by forming a FA-rich layer with a smaller bandgap near the electron transport layer. Here, we attempted to form the top layer with larger bandgap by adding a small amount of NaI into the FAI solution for the third step and investigated the effect of NaI post-treatment on the perovskite layer. The NaI addition slightly enlarged the bandgap of surface of the perovskite layer. Additionally, it accelerated the grain growth and effectively decreased grain boundaries, while the Na+ tended to increase nonradiative recombination. As a result, the NaI addition enhanced the power conversion efficiency from 18.12% (FAI only) to 19.07% (with NaI addition) without degrading stability in air.

Evidence suggests that nonradiative recombination governed by the mismatched energy levels between the perovskite film and the electron-transporting layer (or hole-transporting layer) is the main cause for photovoltage losses. Here we introduced a gradient bilayered zinc tin oxide (ZTO) ETL for fully printed mesoporous PSCs. This approach reduces the energy loss and augments the V-oc, which benefits from the suitable matching of cascade level between the perovskite and the ZTO ETL. By tuning of the Zn content, ZTO films with gradient energy levels and different carrier concentrations are acquired. Our optimized device delivers a high V-oc of 1.02 V and PCE of 15.86%. These findings provide a simple pathway to design the interface between ETL and perovskite and to tailor the band alignment to suppress interfacial trap-assisted recombination of fully printed mesoporous PSCs for enhancing V-oc and charge extraction simultaneously.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2574-0962,,,,,MAR,2019,2,3,,,,,2034,2042,,10.1021/acsaem.8b02104,,,,,,,,WOS:000462944700051,,,,,

Recently hole blocking layer-free perovskite solar cells, getting rid of complex and high-temperature fabrication processes, have engaged in innovative designs of photovoltaic devices. However, the elimination of the hole blocking layer constrains the energy conversion efficiencies of perovskite solar cells and severely degrades the stabilities. In this paper a simple approach (without energy-consuming and time-consuming procedures) for the fabrication of hole blocking layer-free perovskite solar cells has been demonstrated by an integration of copper-silver alloy nanoparticles, which are synthesized by the wet chemical method with controllable diameters and elemental compositions. The rear-side integration of the subwavelength-sized silver-copper alloy particles (200 nm diameter), through a spraying/drying method, realizes a pronounced absorption enhancement of the perovskite layer by effectively light scattering in a broadband wavelength range and achieves a series resistance decrease of the solar cell because of high electrical conductivities of the alloy particles. The particle integration achieves the highest efficiency of 18.89% due to the significant improvement in both optical and electrical properties of solar cells, making this device one of the highest-performing hole blocking layer-free perovskite solar cells and plasmonic perovskite solar cells. Moreover, the copper based nanoparticles prevent the perovskite from diffusing into metal back electrodes. Because the diffusion can lead to a severe corrosion of the Au electrode and thus an efficiency degradation, the alloy nanoparticle integration between the perovskite and the electrode results in 80% and 200% improvements in the long-term stability and the photostability of solar cells, respectively. Through the proposed simple and effective fabrication process, our results open up new opportunities in the manufacturability of perovskite solar cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2574-0962,,,,,MAR,2019,2,3,,,,,2094,2103,,10.1021/acsaem.8b02145,,,,,,,,WOS:000462944700058,,,,,

The stability is the result of the direct specific interaction between the polymer and the perovskite that reduces ion migration, charge recombination, trap-state density, and dark currents and at the same time leads to improve mobility and carrier lifetime. The interaction between the polymer and PbI2 also improves the crystallization kinetics, leading to larger grain size in the perovskite films.

We show that the average surface photovoltage sign is dominated by the band bending at the buried perovskite-substrate interface. However, the film exhibits substantial variations in the spatial and temporal response of the photovoltage. Under illumination, the photovoltage equilibrates over hundreds of microseconds, a time scale associated with ionic motion and trapped electronic carriers. Surprisingly, we observe that the surface photovoltage of the 2D grain centers evolves more rapidly in time than at the grain boundaries. We propose that the slower evolution at grain boundaries is due to a combination of ion migration occurring between PbI4 planes, as well as electronic carriers traversing grain boundary traps, thereby changing the time-dependent band unbending at grain boundaries.

Microstructured gold electrode arrays were used to investigate the charge transport across a rnetal-perovskite interface and through micrometers of the perovsldte films. Symmetrical contact configuration enabled detailed polarization studies. Hysteresis in the current-voltage characteristics and a corresponding current-time behavior indicated limitations by charge transfer in the contacts. Hysteresis was less pronounced in PEA(0.08)FA(0.92)SnI(3) compared with FASnI(3). This is explained by a 2-dimensional interlayer at the contacts, which leads to decreased field-induced migration of ions at the contact. Carrier recombination in the bulk of FASnI(3) however, was only slightly modified by the presence of PEA. Ferntosecond broadband transient absorption experiments up to 1.5 ns provided rate constants for the Auger and bimolecular recombination processes in FASnI(3) of k(3) = 1 x 10(-29) cm(6) s(-1) and k(2) = 3.1 x 10(-1) cm(3) sal, respectively.

Generalized Elliott fits of absorption spectra offer the possibility to determine both E-B and E-g. However, since excitonic effects are non-negligibk even at room temperature, a careful and detailed analysis of the spectra is crucial for a correct interpretation. Therefore, an additional evaluation based on a so-called f-sum rule is applied to achieve an improved reliability of the results at higher temperatures.

Practically, this type of device architecture could also be applied in flexible modules for large-area application.",,,,,"Li, Chang-Zhi/0000-0003-1968-2032",,,,,,,,,,,,1754-5692,1754-5706,,,,1-Mar,2019,12,3,,,,,929,937,,10.1039/c8ee02575d,,,,,,,,WOS:000462661900023,,,,,

Selective carrier collection was accomplished by a p(+) implantation on the illumination side and an n(+) implantation followed by atomic layer deposition of TiO2 on the electrolyte site. The Ag-supported dendritic Cu CO2 reduction catalyst was formed by evaporation of Ag followed by high-rate electrodeposition of Cu to form a high surface area structure. Under simulated 1 sun illumination in 0.1 M CsHCO3 saturated with CO2, the photovoltage generated by the Si (approximate to 600 mV) enables C-2 and C-3 products to be produced at -0.4 vs. RHE.

Under simulated diurnal illumination conditions photocathodes maintain over 60% faradaic efficiency to hydrocarbon and oxygenate products (mainly ethylene, ethanol, propanol) for several days. After 10 days of testing, contamination from the counter electrode is observed, which causes an increase in hydrogen production. This effect is mitigated by a regeneration procedure which restores the original catalyst selectivity. A tandem, self-powered CO2 reduction device was formed by coupling a Si photocathode with two series-connected semitransparent CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells, achieving an efficiency for the conversion of sunlight to hydrocarbons and oxygenates of 1.5% (3.5% for all products).",,,,"Towle, Clarissa/O-9233-2019","Towle, Clarissa/0000-0002-2494-1409; Beeman, Jeffrey/0000-0002-5678-6255; Ager, Joel/0000-0001-9334-9751; Toma, Francesca Maria/0000-0003-2332-0798",,,,,,,,,,,,1754-5692,1754-5706,,,,1-Mar,2019,12,3,,,,,1068,1077,,10.1039/c8ee03547d,,,,,,,,WOS:000462661900018,,,,,

This approach is particularly challenging on hybrid perovskite layers and perovskite solar cells because of the presence of organic/inorganic interfaces requiring the fine optimization of the sputtering beam conditions. The ion beam sputtering must ensure a viable sputtering rate on hard inorganic materials while limiting the chemical (fragmentation), compositional (preferential sputtering) or topographical (roughening and intermixing) modifications on soft organic layers. In this work, model (Cs-x(MA(0.17)FA(0.83))(100-x)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)(3)/cTiO(2)/Glass) samples and full mesoscopic perovskite solar cells are profiled using low-energy (500 and 1000 eV) monatomic beams (Ar+ and Cs+) and variable-size argon clusters (Ar-n(+), 75 < n < 4000) with energy up to 20 keV. The ion beam conditions are optimized by systematically comparing the sputtering rates and the surface modifications associated with each sputtering beam. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, and in-situ scanning probe microscopy are combined to characterize the interfaces and evidence sputtering-related artifacts. Within monatomic beams, 500 eV Cs+ results in the most intense and stable ToF-SIMS molecular profiles, almost material-independent sputtering rates and sharp interfaces. Large argon clusters (n > 500) with insufficient energy (E < 10 keV) result in the preferential sputtering of organic molecules and are highly ineffective to sputter small metal clusters (Pb and Au), which tend to artificially accumulate during the depth profile. This is not the case for the optimized cluster ions having a few hundred argon atoms (300 < n < 500) and an energy-per-atom value of at least 20 eV. In these conditions, we obtain (i) the low fragmentation of organic molecules, (ii) convenient erosion rates on soft and hard layers (but still different), and (iii) constant molecular profiles in the perovskite layer, i.e., no accumulation of damages.",,,,"; Busby, Yan/A-4347-2012","Pescetelli, Sara/0000-0002-3336-2425; Noel, Celine/0000-0002-3000-8914; Busby, Yan/0000-0002-6826-6142",,,,,,,,,,,,1996-1944,,,,,1-Mar,2019,12,5,,,,,,,726,10.3390/ma12050726,,,,,,,,WOS:000462543700042,30832309,,,,

Solar cells or photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells that require the design of light harvesting assemblies for efficiently converting solar light into electricity or solar fuels are of particular interest. Semiconductor TiO2, serving as the photoelectrode for photovoltaic devices (e.g., dye- or quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs/QDSSCs) or perovskite solar cells (PSCs)) and PEC cells, has aroused intense research interest owing to its inherent characteristics of wide band gap and promising optical and electrical properties. TiO2 nanowires (TNWs) have been widely used in optoelectronic devices due to their unique 1D geometry and salient optical and electrical properties. However, the insufficient surface area resulting from the relatively large diameter of NWs and considerable free space between adjacent NWs restricts their optoelectronic performance. Hence, it is desirable to explore every feasible aspect of TNWs in terms of structural design and optical management, aiming to further improve the performance of optoelectronic devices. In this Account, we present a brief survey of strategies for designing branched or hyperbranched TNW-based photoelectrodes and their applications in solar cells and PEC cells. The general strategies (e.g., alkaline/acid hydrothermal method, lift-off transfer, and self-assembly approach) are discussed to address the challenges associated with fabricating TNWs on transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrates. A series of strategies to fabricate judiciously designed 3D branched array architectures, including length tuning and sequential surface branched or hyperbranched modification, are proposed. The versatile implantation of the TNWs onto other backbones (nanosheets, nanotubes, hollow spheres, or multilayered electrodes) and substrates (fiber-shaped metal wire or mesh, flexible metal foil, or plastic sheet) is demonstrated to construct a new class of the TNW-embedded composite electrode materials with desired morphological characteristics and optoelectronic properties, for example, favorable energy level alignment for cascade charge transfer and rational homogeneous/heterogeneous interfacial engineering. The functionalities of TNW-based electrodes include enlarged surface area and superior light scattering for maximized light harvesting, as well as facilitated charge transport and suppressed charge recombination for enhanced charge collection, which are promising in optoelectronic fields such as solar cells, photocatalysis, and PEC cells. Beyond TNWs, one can also integrate other types of semiconductor (e.g., Fe2O3 or W03) NWs into rationally designed structures for preparing novel photocatalytic materials with panchromatic absorption, efficient charge transfer, and excellent catalytic properties.

Further, because they generate less waste, solvent-free methods are often 'greener' and more industrially scalable. Herein, we review the solvent-free methods used to synthesize single composition 'parent' and heavily mixed perovskites in the solid-state. We discuss the known mechanisms for ion diffusion involved in these transformations, summarize and contrast their main benefits and features, and review their use in the preparation of mixed-cation and/or mixed-halide perovskites.",,,,,"Rosales, Bryan/0000-0003-2488-7446",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-4596,1095-726X,,,,MAR,2019,271,,,,,,206,215,,10.1016/j.jssc.2018.12.054,,,,,,,,WOS:000460196300025,,,,,

It compares two sequential spin-coating methods for Cs-0.15(MA(0.7)FA(0.3))(0.85)PbI3 perovskite. First is the static process, with a stoppage between the two spin-coating steps (1st PbI2-CsI-dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-dimethylformamide (DMF) and 2nd methylammonium iodide (MAI)-formamidinium iodide (FAI)-isopropyl alcohol). Second is the dynamic process, where the 2nd precursor is dispensed while the substrate is still spinning from the 1st step. For the first time, such a dynamic process is used for Cs-0.15(MA(0.7)FA(0.3))(0.85)PbI3 perovskite. Characterizations reveal improved film formation with the dynamic process due to the retainment of DMSO-complex necessary for the intermediate phase which i) promotes intercalation between precursors and ii) slows down perovskite crystallization for full conversion. The comparison on as-deposited perovskite before annealing indicates a more ordered film using this dynamic process. This results in a thicker, more uniform film with higher degree of preferred crystal orientation and higher carrier lifetime after annealing. Therefore, dynamic-processed devices present better performance repeatability, achieving a higher average efficiency of 17.0% compared to static ones (15.0%). The new insights provided by this work are important for perovskite solar cells processed sequentially as the process has greater flexibility in resolving solvent incompatibility, allowing separate optimizations and allowing different deposition methods.",,,,"Ho-Baillie, Anita/R-4801-2018","Ho-Baillie, Anita/0000-0001-9849-4755; Huang, Shujuan/0000-0003-3468-4773",,,,,,,,,,,,1613-6810,1613-6829,,,,1-Mar,2019,15,9,,,,,,,1804858,10.1002/smll.201804858,,,,,,,,WOS:000460676900008,30706685,,,,

An appropriate amount of DRCN5T into the precursor can promote the crystallization of film with successful suppression of delta-FAPbI(3) phase, reduce grain boundaries and adequately passivate the native defect sites. In addition, the incorporation of DRCN5T also regulates the energy level alignment of the perovskite to charge transport layer suitably. This leads to the promotion of charge transport, reduction in non-radiative recombination, and boosts the efficiency to a value of 20.60% with greatly reduced hysteresis in the device. Moreover, the treatment by DRCN5T also significantly increases the stability of the devices in ambient environment.

We conduct a Monte Carlo simulation based on a mechanistic model for meso-structured perovskite solar cell to correlate the device performance with the variability of input modeling parameters. The presented sensitivity analysis is statistically performed in two different scenarios: first by varying the modeling parameters individually, and second by varying all of them simultaneously. The stochastic parameters are ranked and quantified according to their contributions to the variation of the cell performance, thereby providing insights for optimum device performance. Furthermore, a reduced multiple linear regression model is derived for calculating the cell performance without having to solve the full physics-based model. The main finding is that the layer thickness of the hole and electron-transporting layers, and the hole mobility in the hole-transporting layer are the three most critical parameters influencing on the cell performance.

The layered perovskite films in this study are found to be a mixture of layered and three dimensional (3D)-like phases with phase separations at micrometer and nanometer scale in both vertical and lateral directions. This phase separation is explained by the surface initiated crystallization process and the competition of the crystallization between 3D-like and layered perovskites. We further propose that the working mechanisms of the layered perovskite solar cells involve energy transfer from layered to 3D-like perovskite network.

To illuminate origin of increased PCE by t-BP modification, UPS, PL and EIS are performed. The results reveal that t-BP modification improves efficiency through two separated mechanisms. First, t-BP interfacial dipole layer can tune Fermi energy level and work function of TiO2, thus increasing built-in potential and improving band alignment at TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 interface. Second, reduced defect states of TiO2 by specific binding of t-BP at defect sites, resulting in reduction of charge recombination are found to be another mechanism for increased efficiency.

The calculated effective masses of electrons is smaller than that of holes (m(c1)(perpendicular to) , m(c1)(parallel to) (me(*)) < m(v1)(perpendicular to) , m(v1)(parallel to) , m(v2)(perpendicular to) , m(v2)(parallel to) (mh(*))), for all values of x; this is expected to contribute to the desirable photocatalytic performance. Effective mass tensor for electrons is found to be isotropic (unlike holes). The optical constants such as static dielectric constant, refractive index, extinction coefficient and absorption coefficient are comparable with that Si. The maximum absorption exists in the visible light region for all the phases studied; making In-doped AlFeO3 suitable for energy harvesting applications.

These hydrocarbon groups are not directly conjugated with the chlorin pi-system, and have a negligible effect on the electronic absorption spectra and energy levels of mono-meric Chl derivatives. However, the different chain lengths of these hydrocarbon groups affect their solubility in nonpolar solvents, which in turn has an influence on the intermolecular organization and crystallinity of their J-aggregates. As a result, these Chl derivative solid films show slightly different electronic absorption, energy levels, and surface morphology with the exception of the methyl ester, but they all show similar hole-extraction abilities as HTMs. Among the four Chl derivatives examined here, the average power conversion efficiencies are ordered as follows: hexyl ester (13.06 +/- 0.72%).2; dodecyl ester (12.52 +/- 1.60%) > methyl ester (10.33 +/- 1.23%) > phytyl ester (9.90 +/- 0.93%), which are consistent with the order of the short-circuit current density (J(sc)) and fill factor (FF).

Aluminum doped zinc oxide (AZO) replaces the conventional FTO/TiO2(c)/TiO2(m) stack, considerably simplifying the fabrication process and reducing thermal budget. Photoelectron spectroscopy suggests that AZO is an effective ETL for perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) thin films, with a large valence band offset and a small conduction band offset, but with a possible path for carrier recombination at the interface. We show that treating the surface of AZO with ozone gas (AZO:O-3) improves the charge carrier extraction at the interface. Detailed characterization of the AZO:O-3/CH3NH3PbI3 interface shows that ozone reduces the oxygen vacancies and de-dopes top 6-9 nm of the AZO surface. The gradient in doping induces an electric-field at the AZO surface which enhances the carrier extraction.

Here, we present the pressure-driven buckling effects of the layered bismuth oxysulfide Bi9O7.5S6 on a 3D network structure. Although no crystallographic symmetry change was observed up to 58.1 GPa, the layer and bonding distances between and within BiO and BiS layer changed dramatically, which drives the enhancements of electric conductivity by 6 orders of magnitude, increasing the photocurrent by 4 orders of magnitude, and significant narrowing down of band gap from 1.34 eV to 0.45 eV.

Nevertheless, over the past century, determination of the formability and stability of perovskites has relied on semiempirical models derived from physics intuition, such as the commonly used Goldschmidt tolerance factor, t. Here, through high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a database containing the decomposition energies, considered to be closely related to the thermodynamic stability of 354 halide perovskite candidates, is established. To map the underlying relationship between the structure and chemistry features and the decomposition energies, a well-functioned machine learning (ML) model is trained over this theory-based database and further validated by experimental observations of perovskite formability (F-1 score, 95.9%) of 246 A(2)B(I)B(III)X-6 compounds that are not present in the training database; the model performs a lot better than empirical descriptors such as tolerance factor t (F-1 score, 77.5%).

Solution-processed fabrication technique is the most widely adopted for preparing perovskite films because of its low cost. In the solution-proceed perovskite films, solvents not only play the role of dissolving the solute but also participate in the crystallization of perovskite. In the one-step method, solvents play key roles in controlling morphology, widening process window, and achieving room-temperature crystallization of perovskite films. In addition, the solvents play important roles in controlling the nuclei/growth, suppressing volume expansion during the two-step method.

Depending on the measurement conditions, two complementary mechanisms appear to control the I-V behavior. First, ionic species contribute to the conduction, and because of their slow-moving nature, a slower scan rate gives ions enough time to take part in conduction (i.e., below a relaxation frequency). Second, migration of ionic species to the interface(s) modulates the Schottky junction and, consequently, the electronic transport across the interfaces.

The prepared films possess synergestic advantages of single crystals and polymers, such as, enhanced material stability, maintenance of excellent charge transport and feasibility to prepare thick films. Prototypical thick junction photodiodes based on such composite films are fabricated. The devices presented decent photoresponse in the visible region, low dark current and noise, improved stability and compelling fast response of 800 ns.

However, the commercialization of organic-inorganic hybrid solar cells is hampered by costly electrocatalysts or hole-transport materials. Currently, state-of-the-art dye- or quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells and perovskite solar cells necessitate noble metals and high-price polymeric materials.

However, their current-voltage (I-V) curves often exhibit hysteresis characteristics, which not only strongly affect the accuracy of measurements but also seriously impair device performance, and, moreover, their actual origin is still the subject of debate. Here, a single HOIP micro/nanowire-based two-terminal device was constructed. Not only can its hysteresis properties be accurately modulated, but also their origin can clearly be identified as variations in the surface barrier related to trap filling. Under illumination of the entire device with visible (VIS) light, two anticlockwise hysteresis loops appear symmetrically in cyclic I-V curves. Interestingly, the cyclic I-V curves can be switchably changed into asymmetrical 8-shaped hysteresis loops with bipolar resistive switching (RS) features when only the vicinity of one electrode is illuminated. The traps located in the surface space charge region play a crucial role in the tunable hysteresis behaviour. Owing to the presence of abundant surface states, two back-to-back connected diodes related to the surface barrier can be formed in the two-terminal device. With the synergistic assistance of illumination and bias, moreover, the injection and extraction of holes in the surface space charge region can effectively modulate the surface barrier, which triggers the formation of a bipolar RS device. Accordingly, two switchable back-to-back connected bipolar RS devices were built. Regarding the tunable hysteresis with nonvolatile memory properties controlled by the synergistic action of bias and illumination, our results provide a valuable insight into the identification of its origin and, furthermore, also indicate that the HOIP materials have significant potential in nonvolatile memory applications.",,,,"Lei, Shuijin/K-2603-2014","Lei, Shuijin/0000-0003-4586-4059",,,,,,,,,,,,2040-3364,2040-3372,,,,21-Feb,2019,11,7,,,,,3360,3369,,10.1039/c8nr08934e,,,,,,,,WOS:000459580000028,30724937,,,,

While every layer of a PSC has been shown to impact its durability in power output, the hole-transport layer (HTL) is critical for several reasons: (1) it is in direct contact with the perovskite layer, (2) it often contains mobile ions, like Li+-which in this case are hygroscopic, and (3) it usually has the lowest thermal stability of all layers in the stack. Therefore, HTL engineering is one method with a high return on investment for PSC stability and lifetime. Research has progressed in understanding design rules for small organic molecule hole-transport materials, yet, when implemented into devices, the same dopants, bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI) and tris(2-(1Hpyrazol- 1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine) cobalt(III) tri[ bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide] (FK209), are nearly always required for improved charge-transport properties (e. g., increased hole mobility and conductivity). The dopants are notable because they too have been shown to negatively impact PSC stability and lifetime. In response, new research has targeted alternative dopants to bypass these negative effects and provide greater functionality.

Dipping yields perovskite films with discrete and rough morphologies, whereas spinning yields films with smooth and connected morphologies. The residual MAI solution that remains after spinning is the key factor that governs the smoothness of the resulting morphology; centrifugal force has no influence. A perovskite layer forms as soon as the MAI solution is loaded onto the PbI2 film, then the MAI residues left after spinning dissolve this outermost perovskite layer. The subsequent recrystallization of the dissolved perovskites increases the connectivity and smoothness of the crystals. The final morphology is dependent on the degrees of dissolution and recrystallization, which can be controlled by varying the processing conditions. A post-thermal treatment can be applied to induce the additional dissolution of the perovskites, which results in an increase in the final grain size while maintaining good connectivity. Combining these results, we fabricated an optimal film morphology that gives rise to perovskite solar cells with improved efficiency. The optimal perovskite film has a smooth and connected morphology as well as better carrier transport than rough and discrete films. This article provides fundamental understanding of the mechanism of formation during two-step processes of connected perovskite morphologies that can guide the further development of two-step processes for the fabrication of optimal perovskite morphologies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1944-8244,1944-8252,,,,20-Feb,2019,11,7,,,,,7037,7045,,10.1021/acsami.8b20750,,,,,,,,WOS:000459642200037,30672283,,,,

The organic HTL device shows the lower activation energy (E-A < E-g) indicating a dominant interface-mediated recombination. The defect analysis reveals that the device with the inorganic HTL induces rather deep antisite defects with slightly higher trap densities.

Different from the commonly used conventional approaches to form perovskite precursor solutions by mixing metal halides and organic halides such as PbI2, SnI2, MAI, FAI, etc., together, the precursor solutions are formulated by reacting pure Pb-based perovskite precursor solutions with fine Sn metal powders. After the ratios between Pb and Sn are optimized, high PCEs of 15.85% and 18.21% can be achieved for MAPb(0.4)Sn(0.6)I(3) and (FAPb(0.6)Sn(0.4)I(3))(0.85)(MAPb(0.6)Sn(0.4)Br(3))(0.15) based PVSCs, which are the highest PCEs among all values reported to date for Pb-Sn binary PVSCs. Moreover, the GDR perovskite-based PVSCs exhibit significantly improved ambient and thermal stability with encapsulation, which can retain more than 90% of their initial PCEs after being stored in ambient (relative humidity (RH) approximate to 50%) for 1000 h or being thermal annealed at 80 degrees C for more than 120 h in ambient conditions.

The former material exhibits a (100)- and the latter a very rare 3 X 3 (110)-structural type. Compared with primary ammonium functionality, their constituent ring-centered positive charges have lower charge density. As a result, [PbI6](4-) interoctahedral distortions of the inorganic lattice in 1 and 2 are reduced (Pb-I-Pb bond angles are as high as 166 degrees and 174 degrees, respectively). This results in bathochromically shifted optical features. In addition, the compact nature of the dications produces extremely short lead-iodide sheet separations, with respective iodide-iodide (I center dot center dot center dot I) distances as small as 4.149 and 4.278 angstrom. These are among the shortest separations of adjacent lead-iodide layers ever reported for such materials. When crystallized as thin films on top of substrates, the resulting 2D perovskite layers do not adopt a regular growth direction parallel to the surface. Instead, the crystallites grow with no fixed orientation. As a consequence of their proximate inorganic distances and unusual crystallization tendencies, the resulting 2D perovskites exhibit low excitonic activation energies (93.59 and 96.53 meV, respectively), enhanced photoconductivity in solar cells, and unprecedented incident photon-to-current conversion rates of up to 60%. More importantly, mesoporous 2D layered perovskite solar cells with power conversion efficiencies of 1.43 and 1.83% were achieved for 1 and 2, respectively.

This process uses lead silylamide Pb(btsa)(2) and SnI4 as precursors and works at temperatures below 90 degrees C, on a variety of starting surfaces and substrates such as polymers, metals, metal sulfides, and oxides. The starting surface defines the crystalline texture and morphology of the PbI2 films.

Exposure to light increases conductivity of the ALD PbI2 films which enables their use in photodetectors. The films can be converted into a CH3NH3PbI3 halide perovskite, an important solar cell absorber material.

Alloying, as for instance in InxGa1-xN, has been a mainstream strategy for tuning the bandgap. Keeping the semiconductor alloys in the miscibility gap (being homogeneous), however, is non-trivial. This challenge is now being extended to halide perovskites - an emerging class of photovoltaic materials. While the bandgap can be conveniently tuned by mixing different halogen ions, as in CsPb(BrxI1-x)(3), the so-called mixed-halide perovskites suffer from severe phase separation under illumination. Here, we discover that such phase separation can be highly suppressed by embedding nanocrystals of mixed-halide perovskites in an endotaxial matrix. The tuned bandgap remains remarkably stable under extremely intensive illumination. The agreement between the experiments and a nucleation model suggests that the size of the nanocrystals and the host-guest interfaces are critical for the photo-stability.

As a result, the pristine, Y-shaped XSIn847 gives higher hole-mobility and more effective photoluminescence quenching than does XSIn1453. Additionally, a decreased charge recombination occurs in the XSIn847-fabricated inverted perovskite solar cells. As a consequence, the device based on XSIn847 affords a higher power conversion efficiency of 15.02% than does that of XSIn1453 (12.65%) under standard global AM 1.5 illumination.

It is reported that blocking the contact between moisture and perovskite is an effective way to mitigate the decomposition of perovskite and stabilize the performance of the solar cells.

Copper iodide (CuI) has been diversely utilized as a hole-transport layer in solutionprocessed photovoltaic devices. In this work, for the first time, the power output instability that occurs seemingly at random with an incorporation of CuI in methylammonium lead triiodide perovskite solar cells is found to be, in fact, strongly aging-and CuI morphology-dependent.

In this paper, we consider a simple crystallisation system, being a capillary-written system to enable the growth of single crystal microribbon arrays (MRAs) directly from a precursor solution. It is demonstrated by microstructure characterisation that CsPbBr3 MRAs are good-quality single crystals with highly-aligned crystal packing and smooth surfaces.

An exceptional photo-response having a particularly quick 99 s response time and a 2496 A W-1 ultra-high responsivity is exhibited by photodetectors which are built upon these MRAs. The fact that the as-fabricated photodetectors maintain 90% of their commencing performance following 100 days of constant stress testing under ambient conditions under an illumination of 450 nm, showing exceptional operational stability, is noteworthy.

We have recently shown that 10 cycles of ALD Al2O3 deposited directly on top of the CH3NH3PbI3-xClx perovskite material, are effective in delivering a superior PSC performance with 18% efficiency (compared to 15% of the Al2O3-free cell) with a long-term humidity-stability of more than 60 days. Motivated by these results, the present contribution focuses on the chemical modification which the CH3NH3PbI3-xClx perovskite undergoes upon growth of ALD Al2O3. Specifically, we combine in situ Infrared (IR) spectroscopy studies during film growth, together with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the ALD Al2O3/perovskite interface. The IR-active signature of the NH3+ stretching mode of the perovskite undergoes minimal changes upon exposure to ALD cycles, suggesting no diffusion of ALD precursor and co-reactant (Al(CH3)(3) and H2O) into the bulk of the perovskite. However, by analyzing the difference between the IR spectra associated with the Al2O3 coated perovskite and the pristine perovskite, respectively, changes occurring at the surface of perovskite are monitored. The abstraction of either NH3 or CH3NH2 from the perovskite surface is observed as deduced by the development of negative N-H bands associated with its stretching and bending modes. The IR investigations are corroborated by XPS study, confirming the abstraction of CH3NH2 from the perovskite surface, whereas no oxidation of its inorganic framework is observed within the ALD window process investigated in this work. In parallel, the growth of ALD Al2O3 on perovskite is witnessed by the appearance of characteristic IR-active Al-O-Al phonon and (OH)-Al=O stretching modes. Based on the IR and XPS investigations, a plausible growth mechanism of ALD Al2O3 on top of perovskite is presented.",,,,,"Koushik, Miss Dibyashree/0000-0002-7609-3544",,,,,,,,,,,,1944-8244,1944-8252,,,,6-Feb,2019,11,5,,,,,5526,5535,,10.1021/acsami.8b18307,,,,,,,,WOS:000458347900089,30624886,,,,

However, the primary stumbling block for their application in PSC is their relatively lower power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared with the conventional 3D perovskite. In this work, through a binary solvent engineering of dimethylformamide (DMF)/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in the precursor solution, high-performance 2D perovskite planar solar cells are fabricated with beyond 10% PCE and outstanding environmental stability. In the formation of the 2D perovskite film during the hot-coating process, heterogeneous nucleation primarily occurs at the air-liquid interface, contributing to the formation of the thin, flaky cap layer on the outmost surface of the film. Sequentially, for the unary solvent DMF, its fast volatilization facilitates homogeneous nucleation, resulting in random-orientated perovskite grains in the inner layer. In contrast, with the binary solvent engineering of DMF/DMSO, the formation of intermediate can slow the crystallization process, making the perovskite cap layer serve as the seed that impels the subsequent perovskite crystallization to be vertically orientated in the inner layer of the perovskite film.

Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy was applied to investigate the electron injection dynamics from the photoexcited perovskites to the TiO2. It is found that the interfacial electron injection rate from perovskite to planar TiO2 is accelerated with increasing Cl- content, which explains the increased power conversion efficiencies using Cl--modified perovskites as photoactive materials. In contrast, Cl- addition demonstrate no discernable influence on electron injection to mesoporous TiO2 , suggesting the interfacial charge recombination rather than electron injection give rise to the improved performance observed in the mesoporous configuration.

In this study, we used large size graphene oxide (LGO) sheets as the protective barrier for bottom Ag NW nano-network. Contributed by the LGO with average size of 60 mu m, less GO sheet was necessary for forming the fully covered protective barrier with fewer cracks, which consequently improved the optical transparency and anticorrosive ability of the composite electrode compared to the one from relatively small size GO. Our experiments demonstrated the composite electrode of Ag NW/LGO. The glass substrate exhibited transmittance of 83.8% and 81.8% at 550 nm before and after partial reduction, which maintained 98.4% and 95.1% average transmittance (AVT) of the pristine Ag NW electrode. Meanwhile, we utilized the steady hot airflow to assist the fast solvent evaporation and the uniform GO film formation on Ag NW electrode. Before the application of composite electrode in organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells, the operational stability of composite electrodes from different sizes of GO with perovskite film fabricated on top were characterized under continuing external bias and light irradiation. Experimental results indicate that the Ag NW electrode protected by LGO could maintain original resistance for more than 45 h. Finally, the PVSC fabricated on Ag NW/LGO based composite electrode yielded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.62%, i.e., nearly 85% of that of the reference device fabricated on the commercial indium-tin oxide (ITO) glass.

Attempts have been made to resolve the rapid-degradation problems, including formula changes, transport layer improvements, and encapsulations, but none of these have effectively resolved the dilemma. This paper reports our findings on adding inorganic films as surface-passivation layers on top of the hybrid perovskite materials, which not only enhance stability by eliminating weak sites but also prevent water penetration by using a water-stable layer. The surface-passivated hybrid perovskite layer indicates a slight increase of bandgap energy (E-g = 1.76 eV), compared to the original methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3,) E-g = 1.61 eV) layer, allowing for more stable perovskite layer with a small sacrifice in the photoluminescence property, which represents a lower charge diffusion rate and higher bandgap energy.

However, poor environmental stability of PSCs has been proved to be challenging and needs further improvement. Here, a strategy of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) antioxidant additive with hydrophobic tert butyl and hydrophilic hydroxyl is developed to enhance the hydrophobicity, control nucleation rate and passivate the defect states of perovskite. The tert butyl group effectively prevents the penetration of moisture, as well as the formed hydrogen bond between hydroxyl group and iodine controls the assembly process of BHT and perovskite. By optimizing weight ratio of BHT and MAPbI(3) in precursor solution, the power conversion efficiency of PSCs increased from 14.93% to 18.28% and greatly enhanced device stability compared with control device. We believe that our tactic of BHT additive can be applied to various perovskite films and will facilitate the realization of stable perovskite optoelectronics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1793-2920,1793-7094,,,,FEB,2019,14,2,,,,,,,1950022,10.1142/S179329201950022X,,,,,,,,WOS:000460316800009,,,,,

For a perovskite layer interfaced between these graded HTLs and a mesoporous TiO2 electron-extracting layer, its photoluminescence yield reaches 15% compared to 5% for the perovskite layer interfaced between TiO2 and Spiro-OMeTAD alone. For PSCs with graded HTL structure, we demonstrate efficiency of up to 21.6% and an extended power output of over 550 hours of continuous illumination at AM1.5G, retaining more than 90% of the initial performance and thus validating our approach.

However, the detailed interaction between water and 3D/2D perovskite heterojunctions has not been elucidated yet. Using in situ neutron and X-ray scattering techniques, we reveal surprisingly strong water uptake into 3D/2D perovskite films despite the presence of hydrophobic bulky cations. Our results show rapid disproportionation of the initial 2D phase (number of layers, m = 5) in methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI)/2D films into lower m phases under humidity. Nevertheless, the 2D perovskite inhibits the irreversible PbI2 formation, which suggests that the suppression of land MA(+) ion migration and consequently of MAI escape is related to the improved moisture stability of MAPI/2D perovskite films.

Although many excellent research institutes and enterprises have emerged to advance commercialization of PSCs, the performance of devices which have large areas still lag much farther behind those of smaller lab scales. The performances of PSCs are predominantly determined by the quality of the perovskite film, which in turn, is controlled by the fabrication process.

One of the puzzling questions in this regard is electrical bias-dependent degradation of PSCs. Several mechanisms have been suggested to explain the effect, but none are sufficient to embrace all observations. Bias-dependent degradation has been observed in several types of previously developed solar cells, and was attributed to a variety of underlying mechanisms. For example, extrinsic and intrinsic migration of mobile ionic species, which are widely believed to be one of the main reasons for PSC instability, were known to instigate degradation of CdTe and CI(G)S-based photovoltaics. Yet, the stability of these types of solar cells was greatly improved by rational design and currently meets the requirements of in-field applications. In this paper we review the progress in the understanding of bias-dependent instabilities in different photovoltaic technologies (including perovskites) and discuss what lessons can be learned to improve the PSC stability.",,,,"Khenkin, Mark V/F-1917-2014","Khenkin, Mark V/0000-0001-9201-0238; Katz, Eugene/0000-0001-6151-1603",,,,,,,,,,,,1754-5692,1754-5706,,,,1-Feb,2019,12,2,,,,,550,558,,10.1039/c8ee03475c,,,,,,,,WOS:000459741700004,,,,,

Despite a remarkable defect tolerance compared to conventional semiconductors, perovskite thin films still show substantial microscale heterogeneity in key properties such as luminescence efficiency and device performance. However, the origin of the variations remains a topic of debate, and a precise understanding is critical to the rational design of defect management strategies. Through a multi-scale investigation - combining correlative synchrotron scanning X-ray diffraction and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements on the same scan area - we reveal that lattice strain is directly associated with enhanced defect concentrations and non-radiative recombination. The strain patterns have a complex heterogeneity across multiple length scales. We propose that strain arises during the film growth and crystallization and provides a driving force for defect formation.

Here, the RS behaviors of switchable methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)) and nonswitchable rubidium lead iodide (RbPbI3) mixtures are reported and it is elucidated on the source of the switching phenomena. By controlling the ratio of rubidium iodide (RbI)/methylammonium iodide (MAI), five compositions of the mixture of RbPbI3 and MAPbI(3) (Rb(1-x)MA(x)PbI(3), x= 0, 0.31, 0.52, 0.71, and 1) films are fabricated.

Plausible explanations for the switching mechanism are provided based on Ag bridges by using the combination of conductive atomic force microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy.

The electron and hole selective contacts are responsible for the transport of photogenerated charges out of the solar cell and are in intimate contact with the perovskite absorber. Besides the intrinsic stability of the selective contacts themselves, the interfaces at perovskite/selective contact and metal/selective contact play an important role in determining the overall operational lifetime of perovskite solar cells. This review discusses the impact of external factors, i.e., heat, UV-light, oxygen, and moisture, and measured conditions, i.e., applied bias on the overall stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs).

It thus requires a clear criterion to select/design appropriate organic spacer cations to improve the device efficiency based on this class of materials. Here, 2,2,2-trifluoroethylamine (F(3)EA(+)) is introduced to combine with butylammonium (BA(+)) cations as mixed spacers. While BA(+) enables self-assembly of 2D perovskite crystals by van der Waals interaction, the introduction of F(3)EA(+) spacers with a high dipole moment suppress nonradiative recombination and promote separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs by taking the advantage of electronegativity of fluorine.

For this reason, the carrier dynamics occurring on this time scale are extremely important in determining the participation of hot-carriers in the photovoltaic process.

However, the typical conductivity of NiOx is low because of the low carrier concentration, which consequently compromises its photovoltaic performance. Herein, we show that the carrier concentration of NiOx can be improved by as much as three times through embedding a small concentration (0.11 At%) of gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs), 2-3nm in diameter, into the NiOx thin film. The enhancement is due to the formation of Ohmic contact between Au and NiOx while avoiding direct contact between Au and perovskite. All key parameters of the PVSC, namely J(sc), V-oc, and FF have improved, and the overall efficiency shows a significant improvement from 17.8% to 20.2%.

Here, we realized an n-doped organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite by directly incorporating AgI into the CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution, to fabricate high-performance PSCs. AgI doping resulted in a balanced charge transporting owing to a remarkable increase in the electron mobility, which was attributed to the aligned orientation of MA(+) ions owing to the Ag+-influenced distribution of electron cloud density. Meanwhile, AgI could act as an additive to control the perovskite crystallization with improved crystallinity and film morphology.

Here, a novel device structure comprised of double-side-passivated perovskite solar cells (DSPC) is devised through intentionally distributing PbI2 to both the front/rear-side surfaces and grain boundaries of the formamidinium-lead-iodide-based (FAPbI(3)-based) perovskite film. The minority carrier lifetime in double-side-passivated perovskite is extended to 1.1s with single-exponential decay using time-resolved photoluminescence.

Herein, we investigated the aging properties of three-dimensional (3D) and MD perovskite under different humidity levels. Through analyzing the performance changes before and after aging tests, the possible mechanism of high moisture resistance for MD perovskite is speculated and verified. After undergoing cation exchange, the surface NH4+ combines with H2O to form NH4PbX3*(H2O)(2) (X=I or Br), and then the two-dimensional (2D) perovskite protective layers are formed on the surface of perovskite, which prevent H2O from destroying the 3D perovskite structure. Meanwhile, under continuous illumination, the -phase FAPbI(3) produced from inside FA(+) may change into -phase FAPbI(3). Therefore, the MD perovskite maintains great 3D perovskite structure and displays outstanding humidity stability under high humidity. The devices retain their starting photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) for 4000h under 40% relative humidity (RH) and 80% of PCE over 2000h under 70% RH.

Inverted perovskite solar cells can overcome this problem by employing metal-oxide free, low-temperature-fabricated, and solution-processed electron transporting materials. However, the conventionally-used electron transporting materials (e.g. phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)) has several drawbacks including poor morphology control and high cost, which make its application impractical. Thus, scientists are actively searching novel organic small molecules to replace PCBM because these small compounds have tunable frontier molecular orbitals as well as good film morphology control. More importantly, these molecules can be prepared through inexpensive synthesis routes. Herein, we report the synthesis of two novel naphthalenediimide (NDI)-based electron transporting materials (4,4 '-(piperazine-1,4-diyl)bis(2,7-dioctylbenzo[lmn]-[3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2 H,7 H)-tetraone) (PDPT) and 9,9'-(piperazine-1,4-diyl) bis(4-(4-methylpiperidin-1-yl)-2,7 dioctylbenzo [lmn]-[3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2 H,7 H)-tetraone) (PMDPT)), and found that the inverted perovskite solar cells with PMDPT as an electron transporting layer can reach a power conversion efficiency up to 9.2% while the efficiency of PSC5 based on PDPT can only approach 7.6%. We believe that this improvement in the efficiency of PMDPT-based PSCs ascribes to the increased number of nitrogen atoms in the framework of PMDPT, which passivates the electron trap centers on the surface of the perovskite layer. This passivation results in less charge recombination, therefore delivering a higher Voc and PCE.",,,,"Qichun, Zhang/A-2253-2011","Qichun, Zhang/0000-0003-1854-8659",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-4596,1095-726X,,,,FEB,2019,270,,,,,,51,57,,10.1016/j.jssc.2018.10.045,,,,,,,,WOS:000458344900007,,,,,

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that the hybrid grows as a unique rhombohedral structure consisting of one-dimensional chains of SnI6-octahedra that share corners and edges to build up a ribbon along the [111] direction. Notably, we find that hypophosphorous acid, H3PO2, is of central importance to the formation of this hybrid. In the absence of H3PO2, we synthesize 2,5-dimethylanilinium triiodide from the same starting compounds. We investigate the synthesis routes that drive the growth of these two compounds with distinct crystal structures, appearance and properties. Pulse-radiolysis time-resolved microwave conductivity measurements and density functional theory calculations reveal that both compounds have low charge carrier mobilities and very long lifetimes, consistent with their one-dimensional structural characteristics. Our findings give a better understanding of the relation between synthesis, crystal structures and charge carrier mobilities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-4596,1095-726X,,,,FEB,2019,270,,,,,,593,600,,10.1016/j.jssc.2018.12.029,,,,,,,,WOS:000458344900075,,,,,
