Among the metal oxide semiconductors, anatase (TiO2) is the most common material used as ETM in PSCs to facilitate charge collection as well as to support a thin perovskite absorber layer. Production of conductive crystalline TiO2 requires relatively higher temperatures (400-500 degrees C) which limits its application to glass substrates coated with fluorine tin oxide (FTO) as other tin oxides (e.g. indium tin oxide) degrade at temperatures above 300 degrees C. Furthermore, this renders it unsuitable for flexible devices, often based on low-temperature flexible plastic substrates. Pure tin oxide, one of the earliest metal oxide semiconductors, is often used in myriad electronic devices and has shown outstanding characteristics as an ETM in PSC systems. Thus, tin oxide can be considered a viable alternative to TiO2 due to its excellent electron mobility and higher stability than other alternatives such as zinc oxide. This review article gives a brief history of ETMs in PSC systems and reviews recent developments in the use of tin oxide in both Pure and composite form as ETMs. Efficiencies of up to 21% have been reported in tin oxide based PSCs with photovaltages of up to similar to 1214 mV.",,,,"Jose, Rajan/C-9944-2009; Iqbal, Yaseen/G-6438-2012","Jose, Rajan/0000-0003-4540-321X; Iqbal, Yaseen/0000-0002-6577-3632",,,,,,,,,,,,0927-0248,1879-3398,,,,1-Jun,2018,179,,,,,,102,117,,10.1016/j.solmat.2018.02.007,,,,,,,,WOS:000428483600014,,,,,

However, the thin absorber layer inevitably contains grain of crystallites and hence grain boundary (GB) defects. The GB defects affect device performance. Therefore, we theoretically investigated the effects of GB defects on performance of solar cells.

However, there is much that is not understood about the interaction of ion migration with other processes in the cell. The key question is: what factors of a PSC are influenced when ions are free to move? In this contribution, we employ a numerical drift-diffusion model of PSCs to show that the migration of both anions and cations in interaction with trap-mediated recombination in the bulk and/or at the surfaces of the perovskite absorber can manifest both current-voltage hysteresis and unusual nonmonotonic PSC photovoltage transients. We identify that a key mechanism of this interaction is the influence of the net ionic charge throughout the perovskite bulk-which varies as the ions approach new steady-state conditions-on the distribution of electrons and holes and subsequently the spatial distribution of trap-mediated recombination modeled after Shockley Read Hall (SRH) statistics. Relative to intrinsic recombination mechanisms, SRH recombination can be highly sensitive to local asymmetries of the electron-hole population. We show that this sensitivity is key to replicating nonmonotonic transients with multiple time constants, the forms of which may have suggested multiple processes. This work therefore supports the conceptualization of the hysteretic behavior of PSCs as dominated by the interplay between ion migration and trap-mediated recombination throughout the perovskite absorber.",,,,"Weber, Klaus/P-8241-2019","Weber, Klaus/0000-0002-2421-6178",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-7447,,,,,31-May,2018,122,21,,,,,11270,11281,,10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b02529,,,,,,,,WOS:000434236700010,,,,,

Demand for self-healing conductors as cost-effective and promising materials for prolonging the durability of devices has increased. Recently, diverse designs of self-healing and deformable circuits have been introduced in virtue of their high stretchability and conductivity. However, encapsulating a liquid metal with a polymer in a micro-size container is essential for real applications. In this work, core-shell-structured liquid metal microcapsules (LMCs, diameter = 2-10 mu m) are synthesized via in situ polymerization of urea-formaldehyde onto liquid metal colloids. Passivation films comprising LMC/polymer composites are simply prepared using phase separation between the capsules and the liquid prepolymer. Capsules ruptured by cutting or pressing release and transport liquid metal to the damaged sites, leading to effective recovery of electrical pathways. Such self-healing of the metal contacts shows the high potential of LMCs for smart passivation of electronic devices. As an example, flexible perovskite solar cells incorporated with the passivation film demonstrate perfect recovery of the photovoltaic parameters immediately after cutting the metal contact, exhibiting a power conversion efficiency (PCE) retention of 99% relative to the initial value (PCE = 15.07%).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1616-301X,1616-3028,,,,30-May,2018,28,22,,,,,,,1800110,10.1002/adfm.201800110,,,,,,,,WOS:000434030800005,,,,,

However, in typical 2D perovskites, the highly conductive inorganic layers are isolated by large organic cations leading to quantum confinement and thus inferior electrical conductivity across layers. To address this issue, the large organic cations are replaced with small propane-1,3-diammonium (PDA) cations to reduce distance between the inorganic perovskite layers. As shown by optical characterizations, quantum confinement is no longer dominating in the PDA-based 2D perovskites. This leads to considerable enhancement of charge transport as confirmed with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, time-resolved photoluminescence, and mobility measurements. The improved electric properties of the interlayer-engineered 2D perovskites yield a power conversion efficiency of 13.0%. Furthermore, environmental stabilities of the PDA-based 2D perovskites are improved. PDA-based 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with encapsulation can retain over 90% of their efficiency upon storage for over 1000 h, and PSCs without encapsulation can maintain their initial efficiency at 70 degrees C for over 100 h, which exhibit promising stabilities.

The incorporated HS boosts the power conversion efficiency from 17.2 to 20.1% with suppressed hysteresis and Shockley-Read-Hall recombination, which originates primarily from the passivation of traps near the interface between the perovskites and the TiO2 cathode. The incorporation of an HS interfacial layer also leads to a considerable retardation of device degradation, by which 85% of the initial performance is maintained after 70 d storage in ambient environment.

Although superb efficiencies have been achieved, it is widely recognized that long-term stability is a key challenge intimately determining the future development of perovskite-based photovoltaic technology. Herein, we present reversible and irreversible photodecomposition reactions of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)). Simulated sunlight irradiation and temperature (40-80 degrees C) corresponding to solar cell working conditions lead to three degradation pathways: (1) CH3NH2 + HI (identified as the reversible path), (2) NH3 + CH3I (the irreversible or detrimental path), and (3) a reversible Pb(0) + I-2(g) photodecomposition reaction. If only the reversible reactions (1) and (3) take place and reaction (2) can be avoided, encapsulated MAPbI(3) can be regenerated during the off-illumination timeframe. Therefore, to further improve operational stability in hybrid perovskite solar cells, detailed understanding of how to mitigate photodegradation and thermal degradation processes is necessary. First, encapsulation of the device is necessary not only to avoid contact of the perovskite with ambient air, but also to prevent leakage of volatile products released from the perovskite. Second, careful selection of the organic cations in the compositional formula of the perovskite is necessary to avoid irreversible reactions. Third, selective contacts must be as chemically inert as possible toward the volatile released products. Finally, hybrid halide perovskite materials are speculated to undergo a dynamic formation and decomposition process; this can gradually decrease the crystalline grain size of the perovskite with time; therefore, efforts to deposit highly crystalline perovskites with large crystal sizes may fail to increase the long-term stability of photovoltaic devices.",,,,"Juarez-Perez, Emilio Jose/B-5365-2008; Arenillas, Ana/L-9080-2014; Qi, Yabing/O-7807-2014; Hawash, Zafer/B-8829-2015; Ono, Luis/G-7685-2014","Juarez-Perez, Emilio Jose/0000-0001-6040-1920; Arenillas, Ana/0000-0002-5388-1169; Qi, Yabing/0000-0002-4876-8049; Hawash, Zafer/0000-0001-9606-3521; Jiang, Yan/0000-0001-7665-1174; Ono, Luis/0000-0003-3176-1876",,,,,,,,,,,,2050-7488,2050-7496,,,,28-May,2018,6,20,,,,,9604,9612,,10.1039/c8ta03501f,,,,,,,,WOS:000433427300030,,,,,

The UV irradiation effect on structural, morphological and optical properties of the perovskite thin film is studied. Experimental results show significant degradation of perovskite properties after 12 h of exposure to UV light.

In fact, it has been found that the CH3NH3Pb(I1-xBrx)(3) perovskite exhibits a better stability, distinctly when the bromide fraction is above 20%.

Cooling of electrons from high in the conduction band to the conduction band edge, however, is much slower, on the order of 1-10 ps. Density of states calculations indicate that excited states with holes deep in the valence band are greatly favoured upon photoexcitation, and this matches well with the fast (100-500 fs) formation time for the relaxed excited state observed in our ultrafast PL measurements.

Keeping these significant challenges in mind, we use ab initio density functional theory (DFT) and incorporate mixed Ca/(Ge, Sn) and Sr/(Ge, Sn) at the B-site of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI(3)) to get Pb-free perovskites with excellent properties. Tunability of the band gaps is observed while decreasing the ratios of Sn and Ge. The predicted band gaps (<2.01 eV) determined using the HSE06 functional reveal that all of the studied mixed perovskites are in a highly favorable range for solar cells. Out of the 12 studied, five materials are in the ideal range for the top cell in tandem solar cells (1.70-1.90 eV); meanwhile 2 perovskites fall in the optimum band gap range of single junction solar cells. The enthalpy of formation study confirms that all of the mixed Pb-free perovskites are more stable than MAPbI(3). We also calculated the effective masses, uncovering the lower effective mass of these materials. We expect excellent carrier mobility as a consequence of this. This work is of high importance for the solar industry due to the low cost (Ca and Sr are highly earth abundant), non-toxic nature and higher absorption of the perovskites investigated as compared to the toxic MAPbI(3).",,,,"Yan, Qing-Bo/C-3607-2008","Yan, Qing-Bo/0000-0002-1001-1390",,,,,,,,,,,,2050-7488,2050-7496,,,,21-May,2018,6,19,,,,,9220,9227,,10.1039/c8ta01490f,,,,,,,,WOS:000434625200048,,,,,

However, only the cations or anions in most additives are capable of functioning as active species in improving the quality of perovskite films.

The synergistic effect between the ions in NH4SCN is favorable for controlling the nucleation and growth speed of the crystal grains, which evidently increases the grain size and markedly improves the film stability. Finally, the efficiency of the device based on NH4SCN (16.47%) is significantly enhanced without a hysteresis effect as compared to that of the devices with single ions as the active species, e.g., NH4+ in NH4I (13.97%) and SCN- in Pb(SCN)(2) (12.88%).

The excellent photovoltaic performance is attributed to good optical and electrical properties such as appropriate bandgap, large absorption coefficient, high carrier mobility, long carrier lifetime and long carrier diffusion length. However, the physical mechanism of high PCE for halide perovskite solar cells is still unclear. The Gaussian 09 software is utilized to optimize the geometries of isolated CH3NH3+ and CH3NH3 at a B3 LYP/6-311++G(d, p) level, and the Multiwfn software is used to visualize the electrostatic potentials (ESPs) of CH3NH3+ and CH3NH3. Based on the ESPs of CH3NH3+ and CH3NH3, it is found that the CH3NH3+ has a strong electrophilic character, however, the NH3- side and CH3- side of CH3NH3 have weak nucleophilic and electrophilic character, respectively. So the electrostatic characteristics of CH3NH3+ and CH3NH3 are significantly different. The strong electrostatic repulsive interaction between two neighboring CH3NH3+ radicals plays an important role in structural phase transition of CH3NH3PbI3 material. At room temperature, the CH3NH3+ in the inorganic cage is activated and disordered, and has a strong electrophilic character. Due to these characteristics of CH3NH3+, the interfacial electrons at TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 heterojunction are combined with CH3NH3+ to form CH3NH3 in the inorganic [PbI3](-) framework. The CH3NH3 at the heterojunction under the built-in electric field is more easily oriented than CH3NH3+. Two initial geometrical configurations for CH3NH3+:CH3NH3 and CH3NH3:CH3NH3 dimers are optimized by using Gaussian 09 at an MP2/Aug-cc-PVTZ level. On the basis of the electrostatic characteristic of CH3NH3+:CH3NH3 dimer, the interfacial electrons at TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 heterojunction are easily injected into the CH3NH3PbI3 material, which leads to the strong polarization of CH3NH3PbI3 material at the heterojunction. From the ESP of optimized CH3NH3:CH3NH3 dimer, it is found that the weak electrostatic field of the inorganic framework, parallel to C-N axis, is induced by the CH3NH3 orientational order, which is made for improving the photogenerated electron-hole pair separation and carrier transport. The TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 heterojunction has more advantage than traditional p-n junction because of no consumption of carrier for CH3NH3PbI3 material in the process of forming built-in electric field. The physical mechanism is the origin of high PCE for CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells. According to the experimental results and first-principle calculations, we can draw an important conclusion that the electrostatic characteristics of organic CH3NH3+ cations in the inorganic [PbI3](-) framework result in the high performances of halide perovskite solar cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1000-3290,,,,,20-May,2018,67,10,,,,,,,106701,10.7498/aps.67.20180236,,,,,,,,WOS:000443195900018,,,,,

Here, an enhancement in the luminescent property of tin-halide perovskite nanoplates (TPNPs) that are composed of strongly coupled layered structures with the chemical formula of PEA(2)SnX(4) (PEA = C6H5(CH2)(2)NH3, X = Br, I) is reported.

The presence of aliphatic carboxylic acid is found to play a key role in reducing the tin perovskite defect density, which significantly improves the emission intensity and stability of TPNPs. Upon mixing iodo- and bromo-precursors, the emission wavelength is successfully tuned from 640 nm (PEA(2)SnI(4)) to 550 nm (PEA(2)SnBr(4)), with a corresponding emission quantum yield and FWHM of 0.16-6.40% and 36-80 nm, respectively.

Strain effects on CH(3)NH(3)Pbl(3) are fully investigated by the first principles calculations. The results indicate that the inorganic framework deforms under compression or stretch and the embedded organic CH3NH3+ molecules rotate correspondingly. A band gap oscillation and a new structural phase in response to the external strain were observed for the first time. These phenomena are explained with the nonlinear structural deformation and phase transition under the external strains. The semi-quantitative relationship between the band gap variation and geometry change under the external strain is obtained. We found that the shift of valence band maximum under the external strain is mostly determined by the most stretched or compressed Pb-I bond of CH(3)NH(3)Pbl(3), and the shift of the conduction band minimum under the external strain is likely to be determined by the largest Pb-I-Pb bond angle in the system.

Interestingly, in contrast to these expected trends, the current density (J(SC)) of PSCs is found to decline strongly below 20% of the initial value upon cycling the temperatures from 10 to 60 degrees C and back. This decline in the current density is driven by an increasing series resistance and is caused by the fast temperature variations as it is not apparent for solar cells exposed to constant temperatures of the same range. The effect is fully reversible when the devices are kept illuminated at an open circuit for several hours. Given these observations, an explanation that ascribes the temperature variation-induced performance decline to ion accumulation at the contacts of the solar cell because of temperature variation-induced changes of the built-in field of the PSC is proposed.

The ratio of Cu to Cu2O in the films can be tuned by the oxygen flow ratio (O-2/(O-2 + Ar)) during the sputtering of copper. Auger electron spectroscopy was performed to determine the elemental composition and chemical state of Cu in the films. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy revealed that the valence band maximum of the p-type Cu/Cu2O matches well with the perovskite. The Cu/Cu2O film not only acts as a p-type modified layer but also plays the role of an electron blocking buffer layer. By introducing the p-type Cu/Cu2O films between the low-mobility hole transport material, spiro-OMeTAD, and the Ag electrode in the PSCs, the device durability and power conversion efficiency (PCE) were effectively improved as compared to the reference devices without the Cu/Cu2O interlayer. The enhanced PCE is mainly attributed to the high hole mobility of the p-type Cu/Cu2O film.

To lower the device processing temperature, the development of low-temperature-processable ETL materials (such as solution-processed ZnO) has received growing attention. However, thus far, the use of solutionprocessed ZnO is limited because the reverse decomposition reaction that occurs at ZnO/perovskite interfaces significantly degrades the charge collection and stability of PSCs. In this work, the reverse decomposition reaction is successfully retarded by sulfur passivation of solution-processed ZnO. The sulfur passivation of ZnO by a simple chemical means, efficiently reduces the oxygen-deficient defects and surface oxygen-containing groups, thus effectively preventing reverse decomposition reactions during and after formation of the perovskite active layers. Using the low-temperature-processed sulfurpassivated ZnO (ZnO-S), perovskite layers with higher crystallinity and larger grain size are obtained, while the charge extraction at the ZnO/perovskite interface is significantly improved. As a result, the ZnO-S-based PSCs achieve substantially improved power-conversion-efficiency (PCE) (19.65%) and long-term air-storage stability (90% retention after 40 d) compared with pristine ZnO-based PSCs (16.51% and 1% retention after 40 d).

In this article, five hexaazatrinaphthylene-based DLC molecules were investigated theoretically, and their frontier molecular orbital energy levels, crystal structures, and electron/hole drift mobilities were calculated by combination of density functional theory (DFT) and semiclassical Marcus charge transfer theory. The systems studied in this work include three experimentally reported molecules (1, 2, and 3) and two theoretically designed molecules (4 and 5). Compared with the 1-3 compounds, 4 and 5 have three more extended benzene rings in the p-conjugated core. The present results show that the orders of the frontier molecular orbital energy levels and electron drift mobilities agree very well with the experiment. For 4 and 5, the electron/hole reorganization energies are lower than those of compounds 1-3. Furthermore, the calculated electron/hole transfer integral of 5 is the largest among all the five systems, leading to the highest electron and hole mobilities. In addition, the hydrophobicity and solubility were also evaluated by DFT, indicating that compound 5 has good hydrophobicity and good solubility in trichloromethane. As a result, it is expected that compound 5 can be a potential charge transport material in electronic and optoelectronic devices.

Herein, we studied the recombination and dissociation processes of photo-excited states in perovskite solar cells with different densities and depths of the trap states in the perovskite layer using magnetophoto-current measurements. The devices with lower density of traps show higher power conversion efficiency and negative magneto-photocurrent, whereas devices with higher density of deep traps exhibit lower power conversion efficiency and positive magneto-photocurrent. As the strong spin orbital coupling is induced by heavy atoms (Pb, I) in the perovskite materials, the original photo-excited spin-singlets (phi(mI)= +/- 1 phi up arrow e down arrow h) will transform into spin-triplets (phi(mI)= 0 phi up arrow e up arrow h) through intersystem crossing. In particular, the spin-triplets and trap states play an important role in photovoltaic actions of perovskite solar cells. Depending upon the depth of the traps, the spin-triplets can de-trap shallow charge carrier traps and subsequently contribute to the photocurrent in the perovskite solar cell, while the spin-triplets will be destroyed with the deep charge carrier traps, giving rise to non-radiative recombination in the perovskite solar cell.

Finding novel materials for solar cell applications is an integral part of photovoltaic research. Hybrid lead halide perovskites are one of, if not the most, well sought material in the photovoltaic research community. Its unique intrinsic properties, flexible synthesis techniques, and device fabrication architecture made the community highly buoyant over the past few years. Yet, there are two fundamental issues that still remain a concern, i.e., the stability in external environment and the toxicity due to Pb. This led to a search for alternative materials. More recently, double perovskite [A(2) B B' X-6 (X=Cl, Br, I)] materials have emerged as a promising choice. Few experimental synthesis and high throughput computational studies have been carried out to check for promising candidates of this class. The main outcome from these studies, however, can essentially be summarized into two categories: (i) either they have an indirect band gap or (ii) a direct but large optical band gap, which is not suitable for solar devices. Here we propose a large set of stable double perovskite materials, Cs-2 B B' X-6 (X=Cl, Br, I), which show indirect to direct band gap transition via small Pb+2 doping at both B and B' sites. This is done by careful band (orbital) engineering using first-principles calculations. This kind of doping has helped to change the topology of the band structure, triggering an indirect to direct transition that is optically allowed. It also reduces the band gap significantly, bringing it well into the visible region. We also simulated the optical absorption spectra of these systems and found a comparable/higher absorption coefficient and solar efficiency with respect to the state of the art photovoltaic absorber material CH3NH3PbI3 . A number of materials Cs-2(B0.75Pb0.25)(B-0.75'-Pb-0.25)X-6 (for various combinations of B, B', and X) are found to be promising, some with better stability and solar efficiency than CH3NH3PbI3, but with much less toxicity. Experimental characterization of one of the materials, Cs-2(Ag0.75Pb0.25)(Bi0.75Pb0.25)Br-6, is carried out. The measured properties such as band gap and chemical stability agree fairly well with the theoretical predictions. This material is shown to be even more stable than CH3NH3PbI3, both under sufficient humidity (similar to 55%) and temperature (T = 338 K), and hence has the potential to become a better candidate than the state of the art materials.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2475-9953,,,,,11-May,2018,2,5,,,,,,,55401,10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.2.055401,,,,,,,,WOS:000433008000004,,,,,

The effect of Ga doping concentrations on the electric properties of Ga-TiO2 ETL and PSCs has been systematically investigated. At the optimum Ga concentration, the PSCs based on Ga-TiO2 and TiO2 ETL achieve the champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.09% and 14.63%, and an average PCE of 16.51% and 14.15%, respectively. The higher PCE of PSCs based on Ga-TiO2 ETL (Ga-PSCs) can be attributed to the reduced trap state density, enhanced conductivity, increased electron mobility and suppressed charge recombination, which will lead to higher V-oc, J(sc) and FF, thus the improved PCE. Moreover, the Ga-PSC shows negligible hysteresis and improved stability compared to the reference TiO2-PSC. After being stored in air for 28 days, the PCE of unsealed Ga-PSCs can remain to be 86% of its initial value.

A c-axis contraction in this process makes a relative large thickness variation in OA(2)PbBr(4) NPs, which can be realized by simply varying the precursor concentration, only result in a small thickness change in subsequent FAPbBr(3) NPs, thereby enabling finely tunable emissions in the range of 525-535 nm along with FWHM <25 nm and a quantum yield up to 85%.

Specifically, a fluorine-based plasma treatment prior to perovskite deposition leads to surface fluorination of the TiO2 ETL. The presence of fluorine on the TiO2 surface drastically improves the adhesion between the ALD layer and the methylammonium lead iodide perovskite film, and leads to a more favourable energy band alignment, accompanied by a faster electron carrier extraction at the interface.

Oraganolead halide perovskites (CH3NH3PbX3) possess remarkable optoelectronic properties and tunable optical band gaps by changing the halogens, and integration with single-walled carbon nanotubes can further improve their photoresponsivities. The CH3NH3PbCl3-based photosensor shows a responsivity up to 10(5) A W-1 to ultraviolet and no obvious response to visible light, which is superior to that of most ultraviolet sensors. The CH3NH3PbBr3-based photosensor exhibits a high responsivity to visible light.

In PVSCs, interfacial carrier recombination is one of the dominant energy-loss mechanisms, which also results in the simultaneous loss of potential efficiency. In this work, for planar inverted PVSCs, the carrier recombination is dominated by the dopant concentration in the p-doped hole transport layers (HTLs), since the F4-TCNQ dopant induces more charge traps and electronic transmission channels, thus leading to a decrease in open-circuit voltages (V-OC). This issue is efficiently overcome by inserting a thin insulating polymer layer (poly(methyl methacrylate) or polystyrene) as a passivation layer with an appropriate thickness, which allows for increases in the V-OC without significantly sacrificing the fill factor. It is believed that the passivation layer attributes to the passivation of interfacial recombination and the suppression of current leakage at the perovskite/HTL interface. By manipulating this interfacial passivation technique, a high PCE of 20.3% is achieved without hysteresis.

As a result, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the TMA-PTC-based PeSCs is ca. 30% higher than that of the devices without CM. It was revealed that the enhancement in PCE might be attributed to the improved electron-transporting and hole-blocking properties of the PC61BM/TMA-PTC/Ag interfaces. Moreover, the TMA-PTC devices show remarkably higher stability than those without CIL probably due to the suppressed corrosion of perovskite on Ag cathode.

Based on this strategy, the perovskite film formed with an optimal DSMO addition ratio of 0.5 v% exhibits a significant higher film quality with improved optical properties than that of the pristine one, which can be attributed to an optimized crystallization process including pre-wetting the PbI2 film and simultaneously Ostward ripening the formed perovskite crystals induced by the DMSO addition. Thus the corresponding perovskite solar cells yielded a higher power conversion efficiency as high as 15.39% comapred with the pristine counterpart, finally achieving a 14.42% enhancement of the PCE.

By tuning the band gap we can create materials with specific absorption spectra suitable for photodetection that display conduction and photoresponse properties similar to previously observed perovskite nanocrystals. We also observe weak emission consistent with indirect band-gap materials.

In this study, compact Ru-doped TiO2 films, prepared via a one-step spray pyrolysis method, have been employed as ETLs for planar perovskite solar cells. Compared to the pristine TiO2 film, the doped counterpart exhibits remarkably improved conductivity, as revealed by the conducting atomic force microscopy measurement. Consequently, the optimized device containing a 1% Ru-doped TiO2 ETL presents a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 15.7% (with an average value of 14.74%), which is 17% higher than that of the device using the pristine TiO2 layer (13.42%, with an average value of 12.20%). The mechanism behind the enhancement in photovoltaic parameters has been investigated intensively via physicochemical characterization. A slight upshift of the conduction band minimum (CBM) is observed in the case of Ru-doped TiO2 films. More importantly, fast injection of the photo-generated electrons from a perovskite layer into an ETL is also found when Ru-doped TiO2 is applied as the ETL. Meanwhile, impedance spectroscopy suggests that the application of Ru-doped TiO2 films leads to an increase in recombination resistance and a decrease in selective contact resistance. The enhancement in PCE is attributed to the improved charge injection and transport properties of the Ru-doped TiO2 film, as well as its better band matching with the perovskite layer.

It has been found that C3 has a work function tunneling effect, which can decrease the work function of the Ag electrode; therefore, introduction of C3 successfully enhances the interface contact and reduces the interface barriers, which usually exist between fullerene derivatives and metal electrodes. It was also found that the C3 capping layer could improve the surface quality of PCBM, forming a smooth, dense and pinhole-free morphology with fewer surface defects. Thus, C3 can modify the interface between PCBM and Ag, enhance the diode properties of devices and facilitate electron transport through the devices; therefore, it is a very promising CBL material for PVSCs. A device with a hybrid PCBM ETL and a single cathode buffer layer of C3 exhibited a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.42% with negligible hysteresis, which was dramatically higher than that of a device based on a pure PCBM ETL.

Herein, we introduced CaI2 instead of PbI2 with much less additive content into the CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI(3)) film and obtained a dense, uniform and surface-smooth morphology with much enlarged crystal grains. It has been demonstrated that addition of only 0.5% CaI2 additive to MAPbI(3) is enough to enlarge the average grain size from 260 nm to 550 nm; accordingly, the defect density is decreased from 5.76 x 10(16) cm(-3) to 3.35 x 10(16) cm(-3) and the photoluminescence (PL) lifetime is increased from 65 ns to 133 ns; as the reference, addition of 5% PbI2 additive to MAPbI(3) results in an average grain size of 410 nm, a defect density of 4.06 x 10(16) cm(-3) and a PL lifetime of 98 ns. In all of these key parameters, CaI2 as a new passivator of the MAPbI(3) film, is found to be more effective than conventional PbI2.

In this study, the surface of compact TiO2 layer is modified by a thin self-assembled dodecanedioic acid (DDDA) molecular layer. The TiO2 substrates are immersed into the DDDA solution for 0.5, 2.5, 4.5, 22 h, respectively. It is found that the PCE of PSCs is improved when using the DDDA modified TiO2, showing optimized PCE of 15.35% +/- 0.75% under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW.cm(-2) after 4.5 h modification. The short current density (J(SC)) of the best device is improved from 20.34 mA.cm(-2) to 23.28 mA.cm(-2), with the PCE increasing from 14.17% to 15.92%. And it is found that the hysteresis of the PSC is also reduced remarkably with hysteresis index decreasing from 0.4288 to 0.2430. In the meantime, the device with DDDA modification shows a significant improvement in light stability, keeping 71% of its initial PCE value after 720 min exposure under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW.cm(-2) without encapsulation. As a contrast, the device without DDDA modification keeps 59% of its initial PCE value under the same condition. To reveal the mechanism, we investigate the surface energy level change using ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy. It is found that after DDDA modification, the valence-band maximum energy (E-VBM) of TiO2 decreases from -25 eV to -32 eV, and the conduction-band minimum energy (E-CBM) of TiO2 from -05 eV to -12 eV. The shifting of energy level optimizes the energy level alignment at the interface between the TiO2 and perovskite. It promotes the transport of electrons from perovskite layer to compact TiO2 layer and obstructs the transport of holes from perovskite layer to compact TiO2 layer more effectively. In addition, the decrease of E-CBM implies the increase of conductivity of TiO2. We further design a series of electrical experiments, and confirm that the modification improves the conductivity of TiO2 obviously with both contact resistance and thin-film resistance decreasing.

A approximate to 45 nm thick compact CuCrO2 layer is incorporated into an inverted planar configuration of indium tin oxides (ITO)/c-CuCrO2/perovskite/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag, to result in the high steady-state power conversion efficiency of 19.0% versus 17.1% for the typical low temperature solution-processed NiOx-based devices. More importantly, the optimized CuCrO2-based device exhibits a much enhanced photostability than the reference device due to the greater UV light-harvesting of the CuCrO2 layer, which can efficiently prevent the perovskite film from intense UV light exposure to avoid associated degradation.

A combination of characterization techniques were employed to investigate the effects of DA doping on the electron donating capability of DA-PEDOT:PSS, perovskite film quality and charge recombination kinetics in the solar cells. Our study shows that DA doping endows the DA-PEDOT:PSS-modified PVSCs with a higher radical content and greater perovskite to HTL charge extraction capability. In addition, the DA doping also improves work function of the HTL, increases perovskite film crystallinity, and the amino and hydroxyl groups in DA can interact with the undercoordinated Pb atoms on the perovskite crystal, reducing charge-recombination rate and increasing charge-extraction efficiency.

Hollow perovskites derive from three-dimensional (3D) AMX3 perovskites = methylammonium (MA), formamidinium (FA); M = Sn, Pb; X = CI, Br, I), where small molecules such as ethylenediammonium cations (en) can be incorporated as the dication without altering the structure dimensionality. We present in this work the inherent structural properties of the hollow perovskites and expand this class of materials to the Pb-based analogues. Through a combination of physical and spectroscopic methods (XRD, gas pycnometry, NMR, TGA, SEM/EDX), we have assigned the general formula (A)(1-x)(en)(x)(M)(1-0.7x)(X)(3-0.4x) to the hollow perovskites. The incorporation of en in the 3D perovskite structure leads to massive M and X vacancies in the 3D [MX3] framework, thus the term hollow. The resulting materials are semiconductors with significantly blue-shifted direct band gaps from 1.25 to 1.51 eV for Sn-based perovskites and from 1.53 to 2.1 eV for the Pb-based analogues. The increased structural disorder and hollow nature were validated by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis as well as pair distribution function (PDF) analysis. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the experimental trends and suggest that the observed widening of the band gap is attributed to the massive M and X vacancies, which create a less connected 3D hollow structure. The resulting materials have superior air stability, where in the case of Sn-based hollow perovskites it exceeds two orders of temporal magnitude compared to the conventional full perovskites of MASnI(3) and FASnI(3). The hollow perovskite compounds pose as a new platform of promising light absorbers that can be utilized in single junction or tandem solar cells.",,,,"Seshadri, Ram/C-4205-2013; Stoumpos, Constantinos/P-6677-2016","Seshadri, Ram/0000-0001-5858-4027; Stoumpos, Constantinos/0000-0001-8396-9578",,,,,,,,,,,,0002-7863,,,,,2-May,2018,140,17,,,,,5728,5742,,10.1021/jacs.8b01034,,,,,,,,WOS:000431600000014,29617127,,,,

As the aspect ratio increases in the 1-D structures, in addition, the charge transport/extraction rate is enhanced and the resistance further decreases. However, when the aspect ratio reaches 6.67 (diameter similar to 30 nm), the recombination rate is aggravated due to high interface-to-volume ratio-induced defect generation.

The thermal stability of the as-synthesized Cs2SnCl6 powders was investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), demonstrating stability up to 615 degrees C, above which a phase decomposition occurs leading to the loss of constituent component of SnCl4. Consolidation of Cs2SnCl6 into dense pellets (94% theoretical density) was achieved via spark plasma sintering (SPS) at a low sintering temperature of 350 degrees C. X-ray diffraction confirms no phase decomposition in the SPS-densified perovskite pellets as a result of rapid consolidation of the SPS sintering at a short duration and lower temperature, and the TGA analysis suggest a comparable thermal stability up to 627 degrees C for the densified pellet, slightly better than the as-synthesized powders.

The PSC with sputtered CdS film shows a higher open-circuit voltage (V-oc) and efficiency of 13.17% than high temperature sintered TiO2 ETL (12.71%). Moreover, a RF sputtered CdS buffer layer between TiO2 and perovskite could tune the conduction band edge of TiO2 and perovskite and passivating the surface defects. Time resolved photoluminescence results indicate the RF sputtered CdS film buffer layer could accelerate charge transportation and a higher conversion efficiency over 16% has thus been achieved, with enhanced air stability and minimized hysteresis. These findings offer new research directions for low-temperature sputtered metal sulfide film as a promising electron transport material for stable and high efficient planar perovskite solar cell.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0927-0248,1879-3398,,,,MAY,2018,178,,,,,,186,192,,10.1016/j.solmat.2018.01.017,,,,,,,,WOS:000427337300023,,,,,

In order to address these issues, we have designed a new type of composite hole-transport materials based on a new metal-organic copper complex (CuH) and Spiro-OMeTAD. The incorporation of the molecularly bulky HTM CuH into the Spiro-OMeTAD material efficiently improves the hole mobility and suppresses the aggregation in the Spiro-OMeTAD film. As a result, the conversion efficiencies obtained for perovskite solar cells based on the composite HTM system reached as high as 18.83%, which is superior to solar cells based on the individual hole-transport materials CuH (15.75%) or Spiro-OMeTAD (14.47%) under the same working conditions.

The reason consists in substantial chemical impact of the solvent during drying that lessens control of crystallisation and reproducibility. This current investigation proposes very fast crystallisation by means of a flash lamp to solve those issues. CH3NH3PbI3 films were prepared on glass and silicon substrates by spin-coating from N, N-dimethylformamide based solutions with various CH3NH3I to PbI2 ratios (1:1, 2:1 and 3:1). Thermal annealing of as-deposited films at 85 degrees C, 120 degrees C and 140 degrees C was compared with the flash lamp annealing realised via sub-second high energy xenon light illumination from the uncoated glass side. Optimal light pulse length and energy density were found to be 2.7 ms and 8 J/cm(2), respectively. According to our simulations based on the finite element model the perovskite layers underwent to a short-term heating to 350-425 degrees C followed by cooling to 100 degrees C within 3 ms. No decomposition of the perovskite was detected. Conversely its crystallinity according to the X-ray diffraction was prominently better as for thermally annealed films. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy revealed the effective elimination of the solvent from perovskite films by flash lamp annealing. High temperature was found to be crucial for the completeness of PbI2 reaction into the perovskite in stoichiometric films. High heating rate appeared to suppress the gel-like phase formation in super-stoichiometric films that helped to avoid the formation of pores.

We find that the coating method and conditions profoundly influence the crystallization process, which proceeds through intermediate crystalline solvates. The polymorphism and composition of the solvates are mediated by the solvent removal rate dictated by the process temperature in blade-coating. Low to intermediate temperatures (25-80 degrees C) yield solvates with differing compositions and yield poor PCEs (similar to 5-8%) and a large spread (+/- 2.5%). The intermediate solvates are not observed at elevated temperatures (>100 degrees C), pointing to direct crystallization of the perovskite from the sol-gel ink. These conditions yield large and compact spherulitic domains of perovskite and improve the PCE to similar to 13-15% with a narrower spread (< +/- 0.5%), while coating at 150 degrees C yields 17.5% solar cells by inducing in situ decomposition of a small amount of MAPbI(3) into PbI2.

To improve device performance, it is necessary to develop PSCs with good interfacial engineering and film crystallinity, which are two critical aspects of high-performance PSCs.

This study reports an effective and universal sequential solution deposition process to specifically address this issue.

In addition, the cosolvent DMSO captures vacant perovskite CH3NH3+ groups at the boundaries of perovskite grains, resulting in the growth of large-sized grains. Compared to a conventional device, this new design realizes enhanced optical absorption, reduced crystal defects in perovskite film, tight contact, and well-matched energy-level alignment between the perovskite film and the hole-transport layer (HTL). This strategy enables the fabrication of PSCs with enhanced short-circuit current density (J(sc)), fill factor (FF), and open circuit voltage (V-oc), resulting in an enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.40% from 15.29% under standard testing conditions.

Tetrahedral texture with the aspect ratio of 0.78 was indicated as the optimal, enabling J(SC) boosts of 26.2% and 16.3% in the selected organic and perovskite cells, respectively. Furthermore, light management mechanisms enabled by the microtextured foil were identified, and each of them was studied and evaluated independently. Among them, the ability to internally trap the un-absorbed reflected light coming from the back side of the cell was revealed as the dominant one. Finally, the optical losses associated with a limited area of realistic prototype solar cells enhanced with microtextured foils were investigated. Results showed that in the selected solar cells, an area at least five times larger than the 2 x 2 mm(2) area of the incident light beam is required in order to sufficiently suppress these losses and enable error-free experimental characterization of such devices.",,,,"Topic, Marko/A-5194-2008","Topic, Marko/0000-0001-8089-2974",,,,,,,,,,,,2156-3381,,,,,MAY,2018,8,3,,,,,783,792,,10.1109/JPHOTOV.2018.2810844,,,,,,,,WOS:000430718700018,,,,,

One of the hot topics with perovskite solar cells is how to achieve a high quality perovskite thin film. A Lewis acidbase adduct is effective for controlling perovskite morphology during the film preparation process. Zinc ion (Zn2+) is a stronger Lewis acid than lead ion (Pb2+) and it has a high ability to coordinate with methylamine groups (CH3NH3 +), so it is doped into perovskite precursors to substitute for Pb2+ to influence crystallization during the annealing process. In this work, by adjusting zinc ion's concentration, high quality perovskite films with larger grain sizes and fewer pinholes were obtained. Finally, the average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells based on optimal concentration reached to 16.3% (with an open circuit voltage of 1.06 V, short circuit current density of 21.98 mA cm(-2), and fill factor of 70%), resulting in a 34.7% improvement compared to a pristine one.

However, a simple manufacturing process without additional heat treatment is desirable for low-cost production. Remarkably, we observed an absence of photocurrent hysteresis of perovskite solar cell with as-deposited PCBM/C60 layer. To understand what caused hysteresis-free photocurrent behaviors, PL quenching studies were conducted using time-resolved lifetime decays and deconvoluted PL analysis. It is found that the perovskite/PCBM layer, which was not thermally treated after deposition, led to inefficient defect passivation of grain boundaries (GBs) and defective domains at the perovskite interface. This led to charge trapping and detrapping events at the perovskite/PCBM interface, which caused the photocurrent hysteresis behaviors.

The value of D-rate increases by an order of magnitude from about 0.02 to 0.35 inA cm(-2) min(-1) after light-IV testing. The accelerated degradation progress is proven to be dominated by the hydration process and the migration of the iodine ions of the light current. The migration of the iodine ions enhances the hydration process through a chain reaction, enabling the formation of fast diffusion channels for both H2O and O-2, which induce the rapid decomposition of the perovskite film and increase the density of the trap state.

Yet, their photovoltaic performance still lags considerably behind their lead-counterparts. Improving their performance requires a detailed knowledge of the photoinduced carrier dynamics and kinetics in these systems. In the current study, we present a detailed investigation of layered BiI3. The compound exhibits pronounced exciton dynamics which is associated with a characteristic second-derivative type feature in the transient absorption spectra. Accurate time constants are assigned to carrier cooling and recombination processes. Pronounced coherent oscillations are observed in the kinetic traces indicating strong electron-phonon coupling. Analysis of the coherences recovers the steady-state Raman spectrum of BiI3 with a dominant mode of A(g) symmetry at 114 cm(-1), associated with the zone center C(Gamma) phonon. The line position is well reproduced by DFT calculations. In terms of the carrier lifetime, high absorption coefficient and band-gap position, BiI3 is a promising candidate as a photovoltaic material but challenges posed are the difficulty to split the strongly bound excitons which are confined in the 2D layers and the efficient extraction of electrons and holes at n-and p-selective contacts, beside well-known issues regarding high resistivity and the intrinsic softness of this material.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1463-9076,1463-9084,,,,28-Apr,2018,20,16,,,,,10677,10685,,10.1039/c7cp07729g,,,,,,,,WOS:000431821800010,29260159,,,,

We tested several X-donor bases (X = : N, : O, : S), paying attention to the thermodynamic stability of the final MAPI.base adducts and to their electronic properties. Factors that impact on the passivation mechanism are the directionality of the Lewis base lone pair and its enhanced/reduced overlap with MAPI Pb p orbitals, the dipole moment of the base and, similarly, the electronegativity of the X donor atom. Also non-covalent interactions, both at the surface side (intra, MAPI) and at the very interface (inter, MAPI.Lewis base), seem to contribute to the stability of the final adducts.

Then, the electronic structures, optical properties, and hole-transporting properties are investigated at the molecular level via density functional theory and Marcus theory coupled to Einstein relation. The calculated results reveal that the derivatives with o-OMe or m-OMe substituent exhibit lower HOMO levels, favoring higher open circuit voltages. Most importantly, benefitting from greater order and compact intermolecular stacking, the derivatives with o-OMe substituents (F1, F3) as HTMs exhibit relatively decent hole mobilities (F1: 6.29 X 10(-2) cm(2) V-1 s(-1); F3: 2.49 X 10(-3) cm(2) V-1 s(-1)), which are two or three orders of magnitude higher than that of FDT.

With an irradiation time of fewer than 2 s, FIRA enables the coating of glass and plastic substrates with pinhole-free perovskite films that exhibit micrometer-size crystalline domains. This work discusses the FIRA-induced crystallization mechanism and unveils the main parameters controlling the film morphology. The replacement of the antisolvent method and the larger crystalline domains resulting from flash annealing make FIRA a highly promising method for the scale-up of PSC manufacture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1614-6832,1614-6840,,,,25-Apr,2018,8,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000433706700016,,,,,

Here, a rationally designed 2D-3D perovskite stacking-layered architecture by in situ growing 2D PEA(2)PbI(4) capping layers on top of 3D perovskite film, which drastically improves the stability of PSCs without compromising their high performance, is reported.

Time-resolved photoluminescence decay measurements indicate the facilitated hole extraction in the 2D-3D stacking-layered perovskite films, which is ascribed to the optimized energy band alignment and reduced nonradiative recombination at the subgap states.

Herein, it is reported that self-organized multiple QWs in 2D-RPP thin films naturally form an energy cascade, which enables an ultrafast energy transfer process from higher energy-bandgap QWs to lower energy-bandgap QWs. Therefore, photoexcitations are concentrated on lower-bandgap QWs, facilitating the build-up of population inversion. Room-temperature amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) from 2D-RPP thin films is achieved at dramatically low thresholds, with gain coefficients as high as >300 cm(-1), and stoichiometrically tunable ASE wavelengths from visible to near-infrared spectral range (530-810 nm).

As a result, the ZnO PSC based on MA(0.1)FA(0.75)Cs(0.15)PbI(3) annealed at 110 degrees C achieved a PCE as high as 20.09%, exceeding the previous highest efficiency recorded for ZnO ETL based PSCs.

The perovskite crystallization kinetics are studied using in situ synchrotron-based grazing-incidence X-ray scattering to explore the film formation mechanism. A model of the passivation mechanism is proposed to understand how the molecules simultaneously passivate the Pb-I antisite defects and vacancies created by under-coordinated Pb atoms.

Doping with iodines decreases the nonadiabatic charge-phonon coupling because iodines are heavier and slower than bromines and because the overlap between the electron and hole wave functions is reduced. In general, the nonradiative electron-hole recombination proceeds slowly, on a nanosecond time scale, due to small sub 1 meV nonadiabatic coupling and short sub-10 fs coherence times.

By introducing a V2O5 optical coupling layer, the PCE is enhanced to 8.91% illuminated from the Ag film side, which is 63% improvement compared with the bare Ag film electrode, whereas the PCE illuminated from the ITO side remains almost unchanged. Moreover, when a back-reflector is employed, the PCE of device could be further improved to 15.39% by illumination from the ITO side and 12.44% by illumination from the Ag side. The devices also show superior semitransparent properties and exhibit negligible photocurrent hysteresis, irrespective of the side from which the light is illuminated.

Here, controllable crystallization for growing high-quality films with the improvements of increased crystallinity and strengthened preferred orientation through a introducing rubidium cation into the methylammonium Sn-Pb perovskite system (65% Sn) is achieved. Fundamentally, the theoretical results show that rubidium incorporation causes lower surface energy of (110) plane, facilitating growth in the dominating plane and suppressing growth of other competing planes. Consequently, the methylammonium-rubidium Sn-Pb perovskite photodetectors simultaneously achieve larger photocurrent and lower noise current.

Conventional solvent annealing using DMF, DMSO and ethanol, etc. fails to work effectively at low temperature (<100 degrees C). Here, we comprehensively investigated the effects of non-coordinating solvent vapor on the properties of perovskite film, and obtained micron-sized columnar grains (with an average grain size of 1.4 mu m) of CH3NH3PbI3 even at a low temperature of 75 degrees C whenannealed with benzyl alcohol vapor. The perovskite solar cells based on benzyl-alcohol-vapor annealing (75 degrees C), delivered much higher photovoltaic performance, better stability and smaller hysteresis than those based on conventional thermal annealing. Additionally, a champion power conversion efficiency( PCE) of 15.1% was obtained and the average PCE reached 12.2% with a tiny deviation. Finally, the mechanism of solvent annealing with non-coordinating solvent was discussed. Moreover, we revealed that high polarity and high boiling point of the solvent used for generating vapor, was critical to grow micronsized columnar grains at such a low temperature (75.degrees C). This work will contribute to understanding the mechanism of grain growth in solvent annealing and improving its facility and effectiveness.

However, the practical application of perovskite solar cells is hindered by their poor stability, which is related to the ion transport properties of perovskite materials. In this study, we explore an effective approach for reducing the migration of ions and improving the stability of solar cells by using mixed organic-inorganic perovskites. The structural and electronic properties of the mixed halide perovskites, namely, FMRCPbI and FMRCPbI, with various cation vacancies (V-MA', V-FA', V-Cs', and V-Rb') and the organic cation migration effects of MAPbI(3), FAPbI(3), and mixed FMRCPbI3 perovskites were investigated using first-principles method. FA cations exhibit high activation energy in the mixed FMRCPbI perovskite, suggesting that the diffusion of FA cations in FMRCPbI mixed perovskite is suppressed. In addition, radiation recombination is slightly small in FMRCPbI with a high concentration of cation vacancies due to the absence of energy levels of vacancy defects in the band gap. With its relatively low recombination loss and direct band gap with high absorption coefficient and high thermal stability, FMRCPbI mixed perovskite may be a new generation of highly efficient and emissive perovskites for photovoltaics and photoemission applications.

In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the recent progress of organic near-infrared (NIR) photodiodes, mainly focusing on diverse device architectures toward superior performance. The key to achieving a high specific detectivity is a high responsivity while keeping dark current low. Interfacial engineering plays a critical role in suppressing the dark current, and has been identified as an essential approach for maximizing detectivity of organic photodiodes. Besides, optimization of photoactive layer thickness and morphology is also highly desirable. As to narrowband organic NIR photodiodes, we highlight three primary strategies: (i) the use of truly narrowband absorbers; (ii) the manipulation of internal quantum efficiency via charge collection narrowing; and (iii) the incorporation of a resonant optical microcavity structure to exploit charge-transfer absorption.

Despite this high efficiency value, the commercialization of PSCs for large area applications at affordable prices is still pending due to the low stability of the devices under ambient atmospheric conditions and the very high cost of the hole transporting materials (HTMs) used as the charge transporting layer in these devices. To cope with these challenges, the use of cheap HTMs can play a dual role in terms of lowering the overall cost of perovskite technology as well as protecting the perovskite layer to achieve a higher stability. To achieve these goals, various new organic hole transporting materials (HTMs) have been proposed. In this study, we used a unique and novel anthanthrone (ANT) dye as a conjugated core building block and an affordable moiety to synthesize a new HTM. The commercially available dye was functionalized with an extended diphenylamine (DPA) end capping group. The newly developed HTM, named DPA-ANT-DPA, was synthesized in a single step and used successfully in mesoporous perovskite solar cell devices, achieving a PCE of 11.5% under 1 Sun condition with impressive stability. The obtained device efficiency is amongst the highest as compared to that of other D-A-D molecular design and low band gap devices.

Here, we demonstrate that the addition of C-60 and self-organized PFN to PCBM as a ternary electron transport layer (ETL) can effectively improve the device performance by enhancing the conductivity and buffering the interfacial contact simultaneously. As a result, the highest hysteresis-free power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.31% has been achieved. Furthermore, the device based on ternary PCBM:C-60:PFN can retain 91.3% of its initial PCE over 1056 hours of continuous full spectral illumination after a ""burn in"" period and thus shows a more stable performance than TiO2 based PSCs.

We investigate equilibrium phase stability of orthorhombic Pnma gamma-phase CsM(XxY1-x)(3) perovskites where M is Pb or Sn, and X and Y are Br, Cl, or I. Finite-temperature phase diagrams are constructed using a cluster expansion effective Hamiltonian parameterized from first-principles density-functional-theory calculations. Solid solution phases for CsM(IxBr1-x)(3) and CsM (BrxCl1-x)(3) are predicted to be stable well belowroom temperature while CsM(IxCl1-x)(3) systems have miscibility gaps that extend above 400 K. The height of the miscibility gap correlates with the difference in volume between end members. Also layered ground states are found on the convex hull at x = 2/3 for CsSnBr2Cl, CsPbI2Br, and CsPbBrCl2. The impact of these ground states on the finite temperature phase diagram is discussed in the context of the experimentally observed photoinduced phase segregation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2475-9953,,,,,12-Apr,2018,2,4,,,,,,,45401,10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.2.045401,,,,,,,,WOS:000429780300003,,,,,

The transformed rutilized phase not only bridges the perovskite-TiO2 interfacial charge transfer but also protects the light absorber from ultraviolet- induced degradation by suppressing the survival of holes generated in the TiO2 skeleton. As a result of these merits, an increment of 50% in power conversion efficiency can be achieved.

Nevertheless, polycrystalline perovskite films are still limited by nonradiative losses due to charge carrier trap states that can be affected by illumination. Here, in situ microphotoluminescence measurements are used to elucidate the impact of light-soaking individual methylammonium lead iodide grains in high-quality polycrystalline films while immersing them with different atmospheric environments. It is shown that emission from each grain depends sensitively on both the environment and the nature of the specific grain, i.e., whether it shows good (bright grain) or poor (dark grain) luminescence properties. It is found that the dark grains show substantial rises in emission, while the bright grain emission is steady when illuminated in the presence of oxygen and/or water molecules. The results are explained using density functional theory calculations, which reveal strong adsorption energies of the molecules to the perovskite surfaces. It is also found that oxygen molecules bind particularly strongly to surface iodide vacancies which, in the presence of photoexcited electrons, lead to efficient passivation of the carrier trap states that arise from these vacancies.

Nanoparticles are therefore extremely unstable and easily change themselves or react with active substances to reach a relatively stable state in some cases. This causes desired changes or undesired changes to nanoparticles and thus makes them exhibit a high reactivity and a poor stability. Such dual nature (poor stability and high reactivity) of nanoparticles may result in both negative and positive effects for nanoparticle processing. However, the existing studies mainly focus on the high reactivity of nanoparticles, whereas their poor stability has been neglected or considered inconsequential. In fact, in some cases the unstable process, which is derived from the poor stability of nanoparticles, offers an opportunity to design and fabricate unique nanomaterials, such as by chemically transforming the ""captured"" intermediate nanostructures during a changing process, assembling destabilized nanoparticles into larger ordered assemblies, or shrinking/processing pristine materials into the desired size or shape via selective etching. In this review, we aim to present the stability and reactivity of nanoparticles on three levels: the foundation, concrete manifestations, and applications. We start with a brief introduction of dangling bonds and the surface chemistry of nanoparticles.

This work is dedicated to the investigation of the behavior of charged species at the compact TiO2/OHP interface with respect to electrode polarization in PSC devices. By providing a comprehensive discussion of open-circuit voltage (V-OC) buildup and V-OC decay under illumination and in the dark for the PSCs modified with [6,6]-phenyl-C-61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) at the TiO2/OHP interface and their corresponding electrochemical impedance spectroscopies (EISs), a justified mechanism is proposed attempting to elucidate the dynamics of interfacial species with respect to the time and frequency domains. Our results demonstrate that the retarded V-OC buildup and decay observed in PSC devices are related to the formation of bound charges in TiO2, which is essential to neutralize the oppositely charged ions accumulating at the OHP side. Besides, inserting a thicker PCBM at the TiO2/OHP interface as a passivation layer can alleviate the electrode polarization more efficiently as verified by the low dielectric constant measured from EIS. Moreover, photoluminescence measurements indicate that PCBM at the TiO2/OHP interface is capable of passivating a trap state and improving charge transfer. However, with respect to the time scale investigated in this work, the reduction of the hysteresis behavior on a millisecond scale is more likely due to less bound charge formation at the interface rather than shallow trap-state passivation by PCBM.

Such a blocking film can minimise undesirable parasitic processes, for example, the back reaction of photoinjected electrons with the oxidized form of the redox mediator or with the holetransporting medium can be avoided. In the present work, thin, transparent, blocking TiO2 films are prepared by semi-automatic spray pyrolysis of precursors consisting of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) as the main component. The variation in the layer thickness of the sprayed films is achieved by varying the number of spray cycles. The parameters investigated in this work were deposition temperature (150, 300 and 450 degrees C), number of spray cycles (20-200), precursor composition (with/without deliberately added acetylacetone), concentration (0.05 and 0.2 M) and subsequent post-calcination at 500 degrees C. The photo-electrochemical properties were evaluated in aqueous electrolyte solution under UV irradiation. The blocking properties were tested by cyclic voltammetry with a model redox probe with a simple one-electron-transfer reaction. Semi-automatic spraying resulted in the formation of transparent, homogeneous, TiO2 films, and the technique allows for easy upscaling to large electrode areas. The deposition temperature of 450 degrees C was necessary for the fabrication of highly photoactive TiO2 films. The blocking properties of the as-deposited TiO2 films (at 450 degrees C) were impaired by post-calcination at 500 degrees C, but this problem could be addressed by increasing the number of spray cycles. The modification of the precursor by adding acetylacetone resulted in the fabrication of TiO2 films exhibiting perfect blocking properties that were not influenced by post-calcination. These results will surely find use in the fabrication of large-scale dye-sensitized and perovskite solar cells.",,,,"Kavan, Ladislav/F-5218-2014; Krysova, Hana/G-8016-2014","Kavan, Ladislav/0000-0003-3342-4603; ",,,,,,,,,,,,2190-4286,,,,,10-Apr,2018,9,,,,,,1135,1145,,10.3762/bjnano.9.105,,,,,,,,WOS:000430355700001,29719764,,,,

Using this solvent-free protocol we are able to prepare domain-free MHP solid solutions with randomly distributed halide ions about the Pb center.

In the proposed method, approximately 20% of the silsesquioxane interlayers can be replaced without changing the layer distance owing to the size of the silsesquioxane.

Through the variation of amine fraction, the micropore volume can be adjusted in the range.

Going beyond well reported perovskite quantum dots, all-inorganic cesium lead halide (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br or I) perovskite rods have been realized, both in pure as well as mixed halide phases, via a facile, environmentally benign, room temperature and solution based protocol. Using a series of halide precursor alterations in this general synthesis protocol, we have tailored the chemical and optical features of the rod in a subtle manner. The highlights of this synthesis protocol are the zero thermal budget and the ability to bulk produce and have tailor made control over exact phase formation. Pure phase halide perovskite rods were crystallized in the orthorhombic phase. These rods exhibit a strong intense cathodoluminescence emission which can be tuned over the entire visible range by varying the halide composition. Besides cathodoluminescence, these single crystalline perovskite rods also exhibited wavelength tunable photoluminescence. In addition to the pure phase synthesis of all of the inorganic perovskite forms, the halide induced structural features were also correlated with their optical properties in detail. Halide substituted band gap engineering results were further corroborated computationally via density functional analysis of these perovskites.

Recently, it has been shown that layers of 2D perovskites can be grown in which the average thicknesses of the quantum wells increase from the back to the front of the film. This geometry carries implications for light harvesting applications because the bandgap of a quantum well decreases as its thickness increases. The general structural formula for the 2D perovskite systems under investigation in this work is (PEA)(2)(MA)(n - 1)[PbnI3n+1] (PEA = phenethyl ammonium, MA = methyl ammonium). Here, we examine two layered 2D perovskites with different distributions of quantum well thicknesses. Spectroscopic measurements and model calculations suggest that both systems funnel electronic excitations from the back to the front of the film through energy transfer mechanisms on the time scales of 100's of ps (i.e., energy transfer from thinner to thicker quantum wells). In addition, the model calculations demonstrate that the transient absorption spectra are composed of a progression of single exciton and biexciton resonances associated with the individual quantum wells. We find that exciton dissociation and/or charge transport dynamics make only minor contributions to the transient absorption spectra within the first 1 ns after photo-excitation. An analysis of the energy transfer kinetics indicates that the transitions occur primarily between quantum wells with values of n that differ by 1 because of the spectral overlap factor that governs the energy transfer rate. Two-dimensional transient absorption spectra reveal a pattern of resonances consistent with the dominance of sequential energy transfer dynamics.

In this work, a 3D metal-organic framework, namely, [In-2(phen)(3)Cl-6]center dot CH3CN center dot 2H(2)O (In2) is first introduced into hole transport material of PSCs through band alignment engineering. By this facile strategy, the pinholes in the hole transport layer are effectively reduced, and the migration of Au into the entire PSC structure can be alleviated simultaneously. Meanwhile, In2 also plays a role in enhancing the light absorption of perovskite, which is due to: (1) the large particles of In2 acting as light scattering centers; (2) the emission wavelength of In2 is almost the same as the excitation wavelength of perovskite. Consequently, short-current density (J(sc)), open circuit voltage (V-oc), and fill factor (FF) gain a significant increase from 19.53 to 21.03 mA cm(-2), 0.98 to 1.01 V, and 0.67 to 0.74, respectively.

The I-I bond distances in the thus formed I-I-I-I linear links are not uniform; the central bond is only slightly longer than in a standalone I-2 molecule, whereas the peripheral bonds are significantly shorter than longer bonds typical for various polyiodides, which is confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. The analysis of the electronic structure shows that the atoms forming the I-I-I-I subunits transfer electron density from their occupied 5p orbitals onto their vacant states as well as onto 6s orbitals of bismuth atoms that center the BiI6 octahedra. This leads to low direct band gaps that were found to be 1.57 and 1.27 eV for 1 and 2, respectively, by optical absorption spectroscopy.

Using both lateral and vertical piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) to image polycrystalline thin films, we observed domains in the piezoresponse that reversibly appear and disappear below and above the tetragonal-to-cubic phase transition temperature. Importantly, we observe these domains to exhibit a piezoresponse that is predominantly in-plane for films with the (110) plane oriented parallel to the substrate, providing a measure of the polarization associated with specific crystal planes. We characterize the polarization and its temporal response using both local switching spectroscopy and time-dependent PFM spectra. These data show hysteresis loops with the polarization switching with bias but relaxing back on time scales of several minutes. Our results suggest the existence of ferroelectric behavior due to off-center displacement of the Pb2+ cation, although the local polarization response is complicated by the presence of local ionic and electronic conductivity.

Here we employ a facile control strategy to modulate the microstructures of rutile TiO2 NR arrays hydrothermally grown on the fluorine tin oxide (FTO) glass from a water-HCl solution of titanium n-butoxide (TBOT). It was found that introducing commercial TiO2 nanoparticles (P25, Degussa) into the hydrothermal reaction system can efficiently slow down the growth rate of rutile TiO2 NRs, thus causing the controllable preparation of an NR array on the FTO substrate. The device fabricated with an optimized NR array derived from the hydrothermal reaction solution containing P25 exhibits an improvement of 26.5% in PCE compared with the device fabricated with the NR array from the hydrothermal solution without P25, which is mainly attributed to the reduced charge recombination and the enhanced fill factor stemming from the better contact at the NRs array/perovskite interface.

By mechanical exfoliation method, 2D perovskite microplates with the thickness of around 20 nm are obtained, which surprisingly have single n-number perovskite phase for n = 2-5. In addition, we have demonstrated that the exfoliated 2D perovskite microplates can be integrated with other 2D layered materials such as boron nitride, and are able to be transferred to prefabricated electrodes for photodetections.

Nevertheless, there is a consensus that spiro-OMeTAD by itself is not stable enough for long-term stable devices, and its market price makes its use in large-scale production costly.& para;& para;Novel synthetic routes for new HTMs have to be sought that can be carried out in fewer synthetic steps and can be easily scaled up for commercial purposes. On the one hand, synthetic chemists have taken, as a first approach, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the spiro-OMeTAD molecule as a reference to synthesize molecules with similar energy levels, although these HOMO and LUMO energy levels often have been measured indirectly in solution using cyclic voltammetry. On the other hand, the ""spiro"" chemical core has also been studied as a structural motif for novel HTMs. However, only a few molecules incorporated as HTMs in complete functional perovskite solar cells have been capable of matching the performance of the best-performing perovskite solar cells made using spiro-OMeTAD.& para;& para;In this Account, we describe the advances in the synthesis of HTMs that have been tested in perovskite solar cells. The comparison of solar cell efficiencies is of course very challenging because the solar cell preparation conditions may differ from laboratory to laboratory. To extract valuable information about the HTM molecular structure-device function relationship, we describe those examples that always have used spiro-OMeTAD as a control device and have always used identical experimental conditions (e.g., the use of the same chemical dopant for the HTM or the lack of it).& para;& para;The pioneering work was focused on well-understood organic semiconductor moieties such as arylamine, carbazole, and thiophene. Those chemical structures have been largely employed and studied as HTMs, for instance, in organic light-emitting devices. Interestingly, most research groups have reported the hole mobility values for their novel HTMs. However, only a few examples have been found that have measured the HOMO and LUMO energy levels using advanced spectroscopic techniques to determine these reference energy values directly. Moreover, it has been shown that those molecules, upon interacting with the perovskite layer, often have different HOMO and LUMO energies than the values estimated indirectly using solution-based electrochemical methods.

Very recently, fully inorganic perovskite quantum dots also led to promising efficiencies, making them a potentially stable and efficient alternative to their hybrid cousins. Currently, the record efficiency is obtained with CsPbI3, whose crystallographical characterization is still limited. Here, we show through high-resolution in situ synchrotron XRD measurements that CsPbI3 can be undercooled below its transition temperature and temporarily maintained in its perovskite temperature, stabilizing a metastable perovskite polytype (black gamma-phase) crucial for photovoltaic applications. Our analysis of the structural phase transitions reveals a highly anisotropic evolution of the individual lattice parameters versus temperature. Structural, vibrational, and electronic properties of all the experimentally observed black phases are further inspected based on several theoretical approaches. Whereas the black gamma-phase is shown to behave harmonically around equilibrium, for the tetragonal phase, density functional theory reveals the same anharmonic behavior, with a Brillouin zone-centered double-well instability, as for the cubic phase. Using total energy and vibrational entropy calculations, we highlight the competition between all the low-temperature phases of CsPbI3 (gamma, delta, beta) and show that avoiding the order-disorder entropy term arising from double-well instabilities is key to preventing the formation of the yellow perovskitoid phase.

Here, for the first time, we observed a 10(5) enhancement in SERS for 4-mercaptopyridine (MPY) adsorbed on a methylamine lead chlorine (MAPbCl(3)) single crystal. Compared to the Raman spectrum of bulk MPY molecules, the b(2) mode of the MPY molecule was selectively enhanced. This is attributed to the charge transfer (CT) resonance mechanism at the interface between the single crystal and the adsorbed molecules, which benefit from the Herzberg-Teller contribution. UV-vis spectra demonstrated that the modification with the MPY molecules leads to the formation of a new interfacial transition state, which matches the excitation laser photon energy and results in a CT resonance process under 532 nm laser excitation. The MPY-modified MAPbCl(3) single crystal was further applied to a photoelectronic device, and the device I-V curve was collected under 532 nm laser irradiation. The results indicate that the MPY-modified MAPbCl(3) shows a clear photoelectronic response to the 532 nm light.

High-Q Bragg resonator gratings with a periodicity of 300 nm are directly patterned by thermal nanoimprinting into thin films of MAPbBr(3) at a temperature as low as 100 degrees C. A notable effect of the imprinting process is a substantial flattening of the initially very rough polycrystalline perovskite layers to layers consisting of large crystals on the order of tens of microns with a surface roughness of 0.6 nm. The smooth surface affords a significantly lowered threshold for the onset of amplified spontaneous emission due to reduced scattering.

Compared to the referenced device that adopted poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT: PSS) as the HTLs, these novel materials were favorable for the growth of perovskite film with larger grain size and less grain boundaries. The hole extraction at the HTLs/perovskite film interface and the hole transport in HTLs were also more efficient under the conditions of taking the diarylfluorene-based nano-molecules as HTLs. Through further optimization, stabilized preliminary high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.85% was achieved, much higher than the PCE of 11.90% achieved using PEDOT: PSS. Finally, flexible devices adopted poly(ethylene naphthalene-2,6-dicarboxylate) (PEN) as substrate was also fabricated through the same fabrication procedure, and a maximum PCE 9% was achieved.

The instability of these cells under illumination, however, remains a major technical barrier for commercialization. In this work, by fabricating full perovskite cells (not test structures) that is compatible with in photoluminescence (PL), for the first time we have achieved in-situ monitoring of the localized charge carrier and ion dynamics in an operating perovskite solar cell under light soaking, using nanoscale resolved in-situ PL and time-resolved PL (tr-PL) microscopy. By analyzing the dynamic PL lifetime and intensity under different light soaking conditions and its correlation with the shape of the voltage current curve, we explain the different scenarios of ion migration and accumulation at the interface and in the bulk that result in different hysteresis behaviors. Our results suggest that mobile positive ions, predominantly iodide vacancies pre-accumulate near the spiro-MeOTAD/perovskite interface of as-fabricated devices, reducing charge-carrier separation and increasing recombination at that electrode. After light soaking for a short time at open circuit, these positive ions drift away from the interface under the altered electric field, improving device performance. After prolonged light soaking, however, negative ions, predominantly iodide interstitials drift to the spiro-MeOTAD/perovskite interface, significantly enhancing carrier recombination at that electrode. In contrast, light soaking had less effect at short-circuit because the electric field is invariant at short circuit. In addition to the light-soaked-induced ion movement under short circuit is by diffusion rather than by drift. This result in ionic redistribution and ion-recombination increases PL intensity uniformity across the device and resulting in relatively stable device performance. Our work reveals that the bias voltage during light soaking results in different dynamic processes, which can be either positive or negative. Analysis on the corresponding PL images revealed a difference in charge carrier and ion dynamics between grain interior and grain boundary during light soaking. The larger density of grain boundaries causes a faster ion migration rate in the regions with smaller grains. Therefore, it may be possible to reduce J-V hysteresis by producing larger grains. Our results provide novel insight into the effect of light soaking on ions and subsequent effect on carrier dynamics for better understanding of the operation of perovskite solar cells.",,,,"green, martin a/H-7567-2012; Ho-Baillie, Anita/R-4801-2018","green, martin a/0000-0002-8860-396X; Ho-Baillie, Anita/0000-0001-9849-4755; Huang, Shujuan/0000-0003-3468-4773",,,,,,,,,,,,2211-2855,2211-3282,,,,APR,2018,46,,,,,,356,364,,10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.02.024,,,,,,,,WOS:000427924000042,,,,,

Further augmentation of the PCE toward the Shockley-Queisser limit of 33.5% warrants suppression of radiationless carrier recombination by judicious engineering of the interface between the light harvesting perovskite and the charge carrier extraction layers. Here, we introduce a mesoscopic oxide double layer as electron selective contact consisting of a scaffold of TiO2 nanoparticles covered by a thin film of SnO2 , either in amorphous (a-SnO2), crystalline (c-SnO2), or nanocrystalline (quantum dot) form (SnO2 -NC). We find that the band gap of a-SnO2 is larger than that of the crystalline (tetragonal) polymorph leading to a corresponding lift in its conduction band edge energy which aligns it perfectly with the conduction band edge of both the triple cation perovskite and the TiO2 scaffold. This enables very fast electron extraction from the light perovskite, suppressing the notorious hysteresis in the current-voltage (J-V) curves and retarding nonradiative charge carrier recombination. As a result, we gain a remarkable 170 mV in open circuit photovoltage (V-oc) by replacing the crystalline SnO2 by an amorphous phase. Because of the quantum size effect, the band gap of our SnO2 -NC particles is larger than that of bulk SnO2 causing their conduction band edge to shift also to a higher energy thereby increasing the V-oc. However, for SnO2 -NC there remains a barrier for electron injection into the TiO2 scaffold decreasing the fill factor of the device and lowering the PCE. Introducing the a-SnO2 coated mp-TiO2 scaffold as electron extraction layer not only increases the V-oc and PEC of the solar cells but also render them resistant to UV light which forebodes well for outdoor deployment of these new PSC architectures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1530-6984,1530-6992,,,,APR,2018,18,4,,,,,2428,2434,,10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b05469,,,,,,,,WOS:000430155900033,29528229,,,,

The overall efficiency exceeding 4.1% was achieved by using perovskite (230 nm in thickness) and nanocrystalline Si cells with efficiencies of 10.5 and 3.8%, respectively, resulting from higher open-circuit voltage and fill factor. The external quantum efficiency of the silicon solar cell that was unfiltered or filtered with perovskite layer exhibited that power matching is of great importance to achieve a high efficiency. Moreover, the change in the thickness of perovskite layer impacted on the overall hybrid cell efficiency, which also implying the importance of power matching issue. This study experimentally demonstrates the possibility of perovskite-based tandem cells and the strategy to achieve a high efficiency of tandem cell.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1941-4900,1941-4919,,,,APR,2018,10,4,,,,,537,541,,10.1166/nnl.2018.2680,,,,,,,,WOS:000439423600014,,,,,

To break this single junction efficiency limitation, it is highly desirable to construct a tandem structure in which the high bandgap perovskite is stacked with a current commercial prevailing low bandgap CuInGaSe2 (CIGS) solar cell. Improving the bottom CIGS subcell absorption with a reduced thickness for photocurrent matching holds the key to developing a high-performance perovskite/CIGS tandem device and reducing the overall manufacturing cost. We propose a monolithic perovskite/CIGS tandem solar cell integrated with optimized nanophotonic structures: dielectric nanocones on the top surface and Ag nanoparticles at the rear surface. Significant light absorption enhancement as large as 12.5% is achieved with a reduced bottom cell thickness by 58.7% through simulation. This approach opens up a viable pathway for achieving high-performance and cost-effective perovskite/CIGS tandem solar cells.

For monolithic tandem solar cells, the available light must be distributed equally between the two subcells, which is known as current matching. For a planar device design, a global optimization of the layer thicknesses in the perovskite top cell allows current matching to be reached and reflective losses of the solar cell to be minimized at the same time. However, even after this optimization, the reflection and parasitic absorption losses add up to 7 mA/cm(2). In this contribution, we use numerical simulations to study how well hexagonal sinusoidal nanotextures in the perovskite top-cell can reduce the reflective losses of the combined tandem device. We investigate three configurations. The current density utilization can be increased from 91% for the optimized planar reference to 98% for the best nanotextured device (period 500 nm and peak-tovalley height 500 nm), where 100% refers to the Tiedje-Yablonovitch limit. In a first attempt to experimentally realize such nanophotonically structured perovskite solar cells for monolithic tandems, we investigate the morphology of perovskite layers deposited onto sinusoidally structured substrates.

The CV technique is used in order to acquire a comprehensive understanding of the electron transport dynamics within the TiO2 film, loaded with perovskites, while the structural and optical properties can be easily extracted from X-ray diffraction, optical absorption and photoluminescence measurements. The electrochemical behavior of the adsorbed perovskites was studied as a function of the potential applied to the semiconductive film, which induces transition from an insulating to a conductive state. The localized traps in the bandgap of the composite semiconductive film predominantly govern the electron transfer process. The HOIS employed are either 3D or mixtures of quasi-2D perovskites, for which there is strong evidence that the lead bromide and chloride based HOIS exhibit cathodic peaks at positive voltages. In addition, exploiting the capability of ions to migrate and interact with the HOIS lattice, a perovskite-based electrode was successfully used as an (electro-) chemical sensor for CBr4. All electrochemical processes concurring on the composite hybrid film vary with respect to the CBr4 concentration in the tested solution, leading to a CBr4 detectability range of the order of 20 ppb mol mol(-1).",,,,"Topoglidis, Emmanuel/V-1673-2017; Nikolaou, Pavlos/M-4275-2018","Topoglidis, Emmanuel/0000-0002-0009-9309; Vassilakopoulou, Anastasia/0000-0002-0710-7092; Koutselas, Ioannis/0000-0002-8879-8816; Nikolaou, Pavlos/0000-0003-2641-6680; Papadatos, Dionysios/0000-0002-4441-9458",,,,,,,,,,,,2052-1537,,,,,1-Apr,2018,2,4,,,,,730,740,,10.1039/c7qm00550d,,,,,,,,WOS:000435857400010,,,,,

An Au electrode with a thickness of 70 nm was prepared with one-step and two-step processes using a general thermal evaporator with a 30 cm source-substrate distance and 6.0 x 10(-6) torr vacuum. The one-step process deposits the Au film with the desirable thickness through a source power of 60 and 100 W at a time. The two-step process deposits a 7 nm-thick buffer layer with source power of 60, 70, and 80 W, and then deposits the remaining film thickness at higher source power of 80, 90, and 100W. The photovoltaic properties and microstructure of these PSC devices with a glass/FTO/TiO2/perovskite/HTL/Au electrode were measured by a solar simulator and field emission scanning electron microscope. The one-step process showed a low depo-temperature of 88.5 degrees C with a long deposition time of 90 minutes at 60 W. It showed a high depo-temperature of 135.4 degrees C with a short deposition time of 8 minutes at 100 W. All the samples showed an ECE lower than 2.8% due to damage on the HTL. The two-step process offered an ECE higher than 6.25% without HTL damage through a deposition temperature lower than 88 degrees C and a short deposition time within 20 minutes in general. Therefore, the proposed two-step process is favorable to produce an Au electrode layer for the PSC device with a general thermal evaporator.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1225-0562,2287-7258,,,,APR,2018,28,4,,,,,235,240,,10.3740/MRSK.2018.28.4.235,,,,,,,,WOS:000432715200007,,,,,
