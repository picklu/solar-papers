We show that Sr segregates at the perovskite surface, where it induces important changes of morphology and energetics. Notably, the Sr-enriched surface exhibits a wider band gap and a more n-type character, accompanied with significantly stronger surface band bending. As a result, we observe a significant increase of the quasi-Fermi level splitting in the neat perovskite by reduced surface recombination and more importantly, a strong reduction of losses attributed to non-radiative recombination at the interface to the C-60 electron-transporting layer. The resulting solar cells exhibited a V-oc of 1.18 V, which could be further improved to nearly 1.23 V through addition of a thin polymer interlayer, reducing the non-radiative voltage loss to only 110 meV.

In this study, taking Cs2AgInX6 (X = Cl, Br) HDPs as prototypes, for the first time we suggest that the fast ion diffusion of the dominant defects may play an important role in the performance stability of HDPs. Importantly, we find that the Agi(+) diffusion in a multi-ion concerted fashion has a much faster diffusion rate, compared to the V-Ag(-) and V-x+ diffusion in a single-ion fashion. It is revealed that HDPs exhibit quite different diffusion properties from CH3NH3PbI3. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the diffusion rate of Agi+ in HDPs can be effectively suppressed by applying an epitaxial strain, which opens a promising way to enhance the performance stability of perovskite materials for various device applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0378-7753,1873-2755,,,,1-Feb,2019,412,,,,,,689,694,,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.12.015,,,,,,,,WOS:000456762100080,,,,,

The optical properties of the solution-processed organic inorganic halide perovskite layers deposited on meso-structured TiO2 scaffolds are investigated using UV-Vis reflectance and transmittance spectroscopies at the wavelength range of 400-900 nm. Optical parameters including refractive index, extinction coefficient, real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constants, optical conductivity and direct and indirect optical band gaps are calculated and compared for the perovskite films created by above mentioned methods. Optical band gaps are determined from the absorption coefficient values using Tauc's power law. The obtained values of direct band gap for two perovskite films are close to each other (1.56 and 1.58 eV for perovskite layer deposited by OSM and HCT respectively). For both prepared films, the difference between direct and indirect band gaps is 60 meV which is in very good agreement with that reported in literature. In addition to the difference between the perovskite morphology, the optical absorption of perovskite layers created by the HCT is less than that of layers prepared by OSM and therefore the amount of generated photo current is less.

However, the bromide-rich perovskite, such as CsPbBr3, always suffer from a low phase-purity and poor morphology synthesized by traditional two-step deposition route. Herein, we demonstrate a facile multistep spin-coating strategy to fabricate high-quality CsPbBr3 films on the low-temperature processed compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) electron transport layer (ETL) of the carbon-based PSCs. As-prepared films exhibit more homogeneous with higher CsPbBr3-phase purity and larger average grain sizes up to 1 mu m, compared to those prepared through traditional two-step deposition process. The champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the planar CsPbBr3 PSC is boosted from 7.05% to 8.12%, getting an increase by 15.2%, due to the increased crystallinity and light-harvesting ability as well as reduced trap states of the CsPbBr3 film. To further enhance the device performance, a SnO2 thin layer with much higher carrier mobility than TiO2 is introduced to passivate the c-TiO2 ETL. It is found that the SnO2 layer can not only improve the surface morphology of the ETL, but also reduce the current shunting pathways in the c-TiO2. The TiO2/SnO2 bilayered ETL possesses a superior electron extraction capability, beneficial to the charge transport and suppression of the interfacial trap-assisted recombination. The best-performing TiO2/SnO2-based CsPbBr3 PSC delivers an excellent fill factor of 0.817 and a high PCE of 8.79%, which is the highest efficiency for planar CsPbBr3 PSCs reported to date. More importantly, the unencapsulated all-inorganic PSCs show a promising humidity and thermal stability with no decline in efficiency when stored in ambient air at room temperature (25 degrees C) for over 1000 h and 60 degrees C for one month, respectively.

To boost light absorption, we design light management antireflective foils made from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer carrying random-pyramidal textures with three different pyramid size ranges (1-3 mu m 3-8 mu m, 8-15 mu m). The optical properties, together with the reflection behavior applied to perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells have been systematically studied. One of the PDMS layer exhibited a relatively strong light-scattering property with a high average haze ratio originated from synergistic effect of the appropriate pyramid size and the uneven random pyramid distribution. Consequently, the short-circuit current density of the tandem device was improved by 1.72 mA/cm(2) and thus its efficiency increased from 19.38% to 21.93%, after laminating the PDMS-based antireflection coating (ARC) onto the front surface of tandem device.

We also unambiguously demonstrated that photocurrent and photovoltage of LDRP PSCs are highly related to the position of chloride on organic ammonium salts.

In this manuscript, we provide evidence that the electron flow directions could be successfully controlled by light, using a molecule/TiO2 hybrid system based on azo dyes (methyl red and ethyl red) as an example.

We researched in detail on the relationship between surface morphology of MAPbI(3) thin films fabricated by the antisolvent method and various drying temperature. We found that surface roughness and grain size of CH3NH3PbI3 films together increased with increasing drying temperature. The larger grain size could efficiently reduce crystal boundaries which is advantageous for the suppression of photo-induced charge carrier recombination resulting in increase of FF. However, increase of surface roughness resulted in larger contact area at interface which might produce more tarp states and poorer wettability of HTM solution leading in decrease of Jsc . Surface morphology of MAPbI(3) layer on the performance of solar cell devices is also an important research issue. By optimizing the drying temperature to 60 degrees C, the highest efficiency of 14.4% was achieved for the CH3NH3PbI3 -based solar cell devices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

CH3NH3PbI3 is known to be one of the major breakthrough in absorbing layers for solar cell material researches. These properties allowed this material to break records in the photoelectric conversion reaching 22% in Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE) in a short period of time, but this material have some drawbacks, putting obstacles for its commercialization. First one is the instability and the second one is the toxicity of lead. It was the reason why, the choice of Bi was the most appropriate to use in CH3NH3BiI2Te, CH3NH3BiI2 S and CH3NH3BiI2 Se as it is a non-toxic element and also for the fact that it does not induce a big difference in the electronic structure, being close to lead in the periodic table.

Herein, spin coating and aerosol-assisted chemical vapour deposition (AACVD) are chosen to represent solution-based and vapour-based deposition routes, respectively. SnO2 films processed at low temperature via the mentioned methods are applied in photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell as active photoanode and perovskite solar cell (PSC) as electron transport layer. This study discovers that spin coated SnO2 film which consists of greater amount of oxygen vacancy is beneficial for PEC cell but is detrimental towards the stability and hysteresis of PSC device. The improved PEC performance is majorly attributed to the enhanced light absorption of SnO2 caused by the reduction of its band gap energy. Meanwhile, AACVD method successfully eliminates oxygen vacancy in SnO2 crystal lattice. Although PEC cell shows very poor performance upon using AACVD-fabricated SnO2, the employment of this layer greatly enhances the overall performance of PSC. The absence of oxygen vacancy allows efficient charge transfer at SnO2/perovskite interface and renders SnO2 less hydrophobic which prevents moisture-induced degradation of perovskite layer.

The lasing performance is generally determined by the as-synthesized crystal quality. Noble metal nanostructures have been widely utilized to enhance optical responses due to their unique property of localized surface plasmon resonance. Herein, we report a simple method to enhance the near-infrared amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) performance of MAPbI(3) polycrystalline films by solution-processing a PMMA spacer layer and an Au NR-doped PMMA top layer on perovskite thin films. As a result, the ASE threshold of the triple-layer perovskite film was significantly reduced by around 36% and the ASE intensity increased by 13.9-fold, compared to the pristine film. The underlying mechanism was attributed to the combined effects of surface passivation by PMMA and plasmon resonance enhancement of Au NRs. The passivation effect results in suppressing the nonradiative recombination and prolonging excited state decay, which have been investigated by transient absorption and pump-probe measurements. The plasmon effect is systematically studied through distance-dependent and spectra-dependent plasmon enhanced emission. The perovskite films with PMMA and Au NR coating showed great stability for 180 min under intense pulse laser continuous irradiation. The improved ASE performance still remained after leaving the film under the atmosphere for more than one month.

Here, we show an innovative strategy that uses solution-processed hydrogen molybdenum bronze (HxMoO3-y) nanobelts, an n-type HTM with high work function and electrical conductivity, as the sole electrode material to enhance the hole-extraction process and realize efficient PSCs for the first time.

Moreover, these metal-oxide scaffolds usually suffer from high charge carrier recombination rates and inherent UV instability. In this paper, we develop for the first time an organic-scaffold architecture, which consists of room-temperature-processed C-60 single-crystalline nanoparticles (C-60-NPs) serving as an electron selective contact covering on C-60 compact films (c-C-60). C-60-NPs act as a three-dimensional framework to support perovskite crystals, enabling them to cover the substrate more uniformly and thus demonstrating an advantage over planar heterojunction PSCs. Furthermore, the higher electron mobility of C-60-NPs compared with commonly used TiO2 enhances the charge transfer from the perovskite to electron transport layers and reduces charge carrier accumulation at the interface, demonstrating the advantage of an organic scaffold over inorganic metal-oxides for mesoporous scaffold PSCs. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.45% was obtained in organic-scaffold MAPbI(3)-based perovskite solar cells (OPSCs), outperforming standard reference devices based on a TiO2 mesoporous scaffold (maximum PCE = 17.07%). Furthermore, the high UV stability of C-60-NPs enables the realisation of ultra-stable OPSCs stressed under ambient conditions and working under both UV and full-sun illumination. Moreover, the devices can be easily processed at low temperatures, providing an efficient method for the large-scale production of flexible PSCs.

Seeking a suitable passivation material using facile and efficient methods to passivate the perovskite film for minimum defect density is necessary to further improve the photovoltaic performance. Here, we introduce a novel potassium-intercalated rubrene (K(2)Rubrene) with facile anti-solvent engineering to obtain high quality perovskite films through a novel dual-functional perovskite passivation approach. It was found that the cation- interaction between aromatic rubrene and organic cations can immobilize the organic cations in perovskite, which can trigger heterogeneous nucleation over the perovskite precursor film to decrease the grain size and obtain a more homogeneous and uniform perovskite film. The potassium insertion in the K(2)Rubrene molecule, more importantly, could balance the cation- interaction energy that occurred between the aromatic additive and the organic cations in perovskite films to reduce the barrier for better carrier transfer at GBs. Moreover, K+ could freely enter the A-site defects at the surface of the perovskite absorber and then digest the A-site shallow defects to prevent the migration and autorotation of the large organic cations at the interface between the hole transfer layer and the perovskite absorber, or perovskite/perovskite GBs. Consequently, a significant upshift of the valence band maximum and the conduction band minimum of the perovskite material leads to a more favorable energy alignment with the hole transporting material, which can enhance hole-transfer and suppress the hysteresis, and the corresponding perovskite solar cell device achieves a high efficiency of over 19%, higher than that of pristine and rubrene based devices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2050-7488,2050-7496,,,,28-Jan,2019,7,4,,,,,1824,1834,,10.1039/c8ta09026b,,,,,,,,WOS:000459724300044,,,,,

Under AM 1.5 condition, the perovskite solar cell (PSC) with inverted p-i-n device structure using H7 as the dopant-free material achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.1%, which is comparable to that using PEDOT:PSS as the hole transporting material (12.0%). Under an argon atmosphere, the PCE of H7-based PSC did not decay within 168 h, and it can retain 86.3% of its original PCE after 1000 h. The morphology study revealed that the film of H3-H7 was smooth and hydrophobic, while the perovskite film spin-coated on H3-H7 film was uniform with the grain size in micrometer scale. Although the time-resolved photoluminescence spectra of the perovskite films suggested that the hole extraction capability of H7 is weaker than that of PEDOT:PSS, the improved film morphology of the film in H7-based PSC accounts for its comparable PCE to PEDOT:PSS-based PSC.",,,,"Chen, Chih-Ping/D-1416-2014","Chen, Chih-Ping/0000-0002-0281-7554",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-7447,,,,,24-Jan,2019,123,3,,,,,1602,1609,,10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b10070,,,,,,,,WOS:000457067500010,,,,,

However, the most efficient PSCs using CuPc-based HTMs reported thus far still rely on hygroscopic p-type dopants, which notoriously deteriorate device stability. Herein, two new CuPc derivatives are designed, namely CuPc-Bu and CuPc-OBu, by molecular engineering of the non-peripheral substituents of the Pc rings, and applied as dopant-free HTMs in PSCs. Remarkably, a small structural change from butyl groups to butoxy groups in the substituents of the Pc rings significantly influences the molecular ordering and effectively improves the hole mobility and solar cell performance. As a consequence, PSCs based on dopant-free CuPc-OBu as HTMs deliver an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 17.6% under one sun illumination, which is considerably higher than that of devices with CuPc-Bu (14.3%). Moreover, PSCs containing dopant-free CuPc-OBu HTMs show a markedly improved ambient stability when stored without encapsulation under ambient conditions with a relative humidity of 85% compared to devices containing doped Spiro-OMeTAD.

Thus far, various lanthanide-doped host materials or nanoparticle systems have been investigated as representative upconversion systems owing to their major advantage as optical probes. As for the energetics of upconversion and the associated upconversion pathways, the role of the host material is very important because it provides a unique microscopic environment; for example, a unique local lattice structure in the case of crystalline samples. In general, the upconversion luminescence intensity decreases as a function of temperature owing to thermally accelerated multiphonon relaxation. Here, we report that the temperature dependence of the upconversion luminescence efficiency is affected differently in an Er3+-doped perovskite material, barium titanate (BaTiO3, BT), than in a general system. We show that Er3+ doped at the A (Ba2+) and B (Ti4+) sites of tetragonal phase BT, referred to as A-BT and B-BT, respectively, show different upconversion behaviors. The slope of the plot of the upconversion emission intensity as a function of temperature changed significantly in case of B-BT, but not for A-BT. This anomalous behavior of Er3+-doped BT is attributed to the phase transition (at similar to 120 degrees C) of BT from tetragonal to cubic phase. Essentially, the temperature-dependent upconversion luminescence trend depends on the doping sites of Er3+, i.e., at A or B sites in BT, which is explained by the difference in the symmetry of the crystalline structure with different crystal phase surrounding the Er3+ ions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2046-2069,,,,,23-Jan,2019,9,5,,,,,2451,2457,,10.1039/c8ra09783f,,,,,,,,WOS:000457379300016,,,,,

However, the lack of radiative recombination at room temperature is still not well understood and the performance of PSC is not good enough as well. The open-circuit voltage (V-OC) is even lower than that of three-dimensional (3D) PSC with a narrower band gap. In this work, we study the energy transfer of excitons between their multiple components by time-resolved photoluminescence and find that charge transfer from high-energy states to low-energy state is gradually suppressed during elevating temperature owing to trap-mediated recombination. This may reveal the bottleneck of luminescence at room temperature in Q-2DPs, leading to large photovoltage loss in 2D PSC. Therefore, we develop a p-i-n bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure to reduce the nonradiative recombination and obtain high V-OC of 1.18 V for (PMA)(2)MA(4)Pb(5)I(15)Cl (33.3% PMA) BHJ device, much higher than that of the planar counterparts.

We sort the 2D hybrid halide perovskites on the basis of two key components: the inorganic layers and their modification, and the organic cation diversity.

By correlating with in situ high-pressure X-ray diffraction results, we examine successfully the relationship between structural modifications in the inorganic PbI42- layer and their excitonic properties. During the transition between Pbca (1b) phase and Pbca (1a) phase at around 0.1 GPa, the decrease in < Pb-I-Pb > bond angle and increase in Pb-I bond length lead to an abrupt blue shift of the excitonic bandgap. The presence of the P2(1)/a phase above 1.4 GPa increases the < Pb-I-Pb > bond angle and decreases the Pb-I bond length, leading to a deep red shift of the excitonic bandgap. The total band gap narrowing of similar to 350 meV to 2.03 eV at 5.3 GPa before amorphization, facilitates (C4H9NH3)(2)PbI4 as a much better solar absorber. Moreover, phase transitions inevitably modify the carrier lifetime of (C4H9NH3)(2)PbI4, where an initial 150 ps at ambient phase is prolongated to 190 ps in the Pbca (1) phase along with enhanced photoluminescence (PL), originating from pressure-induced strong radiative recombination of trapped excitons.The onset of P2(1)/a phase shortens significantly the carrier lifetime to 53 ps along with a weak PL emission due to pressure-induced severe lattice distortion and amorphization.

However, there has been no attempt to systematically tailor the characteristics of rGOs to the specifications of PeSCs. Furthermore, the applications of rGO HTLs have been limited to the spin-coating system, which is incompatible with roll-to-roll manufacturing. Here, with the aid of a polymer-graphene hybrid structure and a controllable synthesis method, we successfully developed a much more feasible rGO HTL and demonstrated highly efficient, stable, and printable p-i-n planar PeSCs with facile one-step processing. The characteristics of the developed polyacrylonitrile- grafted rGOs (PRGOs) were optimized by varying the synthesis conditions including the.-radiation intensity (200, 400, and 600 kGy) and the concentration of the acrylonitrile (AN) precursor (2, 4, and 6 wt%). It is revealed that the PRGO synthesized with a lower AN concentration and a higher irradiation intensity (PRGO_2-600) is the most suitable one for PeSC HTL. PRGO_2-600 effectively raises the average power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PeSCs by similar to 36% compared to those of conventional PeSCs using PEDOT: PSS HTL. The comprehensive investigations confirm that the enhanced device efficiency stems from (1) the favorable interlayer characteristics of the PRGO itself and (2) the well-crystallized perovskite layer grown on the PRGO. In addition to the PCE, thechemically inert PRGOs can also maintain their electrical properties over time and retard the decomposition of perovskite films, thereby prolonging the operation time of PeSCs in the atmosphere. More importantly, the applicability of the PRGO HTL is clearly verified even in the roll-to-roll compatible slot-die coating system, exhibiting comparable performances to those of the spin-coating system.",,,,,"Na, Seok-In/0000-0001-8020-6110",,,,,,,,,,,,2040-3364,2040-3372,,,,21-Jan,2019,11,3,,,,,890,900,,10.1039/c8nr05698f,,,,,,,,WOS:000460162900068,30406791,,,,

The photoresponse of the photodetector was carefully studied and compared with the literature, which demonstrated the capability of the MABI structure for detecting light at a very low incident irradiance of 10 W cm(-2).

This self-powered behavior originates from the as-formed built-in electric field within the perovskite film due to the light-induced self-poling effect. The photogenerated carriers are well separated and drift in response to the built-in electric field, resulting in a large photocurrent reaching the nA level without an applied bias.

The decreased work function of Ag improves the ohmic contact between PC61BM and Ag, facilitating carrier extraction and suppressing the charge recombination at the interface of PC61BM and the Ag electrode. As a result, the reverse saturation current of the final PSC is decreased by approximately one order of magnitude, which is consistent with a larger V-OC.

H. Miao, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2017, 139, 11125-11131]. For these applications, excellent contact performance between m-InP3 and the electrodes is vital. In this work, by first-principles calculations, the electronic structures of m-InP3 in contact with graphene (G) and Ni are investigated and the contact characters are further tuned by inserting a buffer layer, e.g., a G or BN monolayer (m-BN) along with the introduction of intrinsic P- and In-vacancy defects. For m-InP3 in contact with G, inserting an m-BN can alter the contact character from an n-type to a p-type Schottky contact. This is consistent with the prediction of the Schottky-Mott rule, indicating that Fermi level pinning is removed in the interface. However, for the contact with Ni, if an m-BN or G is inserted into the interface, an n-type Ohmic contact is obtained, rather than the p-type Schottky one based on the Schottky-Mott rule. We attribute this inconsistency to the effect of electron transfer from m-BN or G to Ni, which leads to a decreased work function for Ni. Additionally, introducing In- and P-vacancy defects can reduce the Schottky barrier in the interfaces between m-InP3 and G or Ni. Moreover, if m-BN is inserted into these defect-containing interfaces, an n-type Ohmic contact could be achieved and dominate the contact character. Our results offer deeper insights into factors such as the Fermi level pinning on the band alignment of the interfaces between m-InP3 and G or Ni, and how the contact characters are improved by inserting a buffer layer along with the introduction of In- and P-vacancy defects.",,,,"Ma, Liang/B-5998-2012","Ma, Liang/0000-0003-4747-613X",,,,,,,,,,,,1463-9076,1463-9084,,,,21-Jan,2019,21,3,,,,,1285,1293,,10.1039/c8cp06478d,,,,,,,,WOS:000456147000031,30569927,,,,

As is well known, the excellent passivation of a-Si:H/c-Si interface is the key to achieving a high-efficiency planar silicon heterojunction solar cell, which further improves the performance of the corresponding tandem cell. Therefore, we investigate the elements affecting a-Si:H/c-Si interface passivation, including the c-Si surface treatment technique, a-Si:H passivation layer and P-type emitter layer and so on. In these experiments, we adjust the immersed time of diluent hydrofluoric acid and pre-deposited hydrogen plasma with different gas mixture flows. Also, the suitable deposition parameters of intrinsic a-Si:H passivation layer are regulated by varying hydrogen dilution and time, and variously slight silane content is embedded into i-a-Si:H /P-type (I/P) emitter interface by hydrogen-rich plasma treating which is for acquiring optimal experimental processing conditions to promote the chemical passivation. In addition, the p-a-Si:H and p-nc-Si:H are comparatively studied as buffer layers to further improve the I/P interface passivation by varying the hydrogen dilution in the gas mixture during deposition. It can be found that p-nc-Si:H buffer layer with high conductivity and wide bandgap can not only reduce the defect density at the I/P interface, but also increase the conductivity of P-type emitter, which further improves the field passivation effect. By the above- mentioned optimization, the highest minority carrier lifetime and implied open-circuit voltage (iV(o)(c)) of the structure of P-type emitter/a-Si:H(i)/c-Si/a-Si:H(i)/N-type layer (inip) sample can respectively reach 2855 jts and 709 mV, which demonstrates authentically outstanding passivation performance.

Specifically, charge transfer through the surface state of Cs2SnI6 and its subsequent surface state charging are demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry and Mott-Schottky measurements, respectively.

As expected, the performance of the Cs2SnI6-based regenerator is strongly dependent on the highest occupied molecular orbital of the dyes. Consequently, Cs2SnI6 shows efficient charge transfer with a thermodynamically favorable charge acceptor level, achieving a 79% enhancement in the photocurrent density (14.1 mA cm(-2)) compared with that of a conventional liquid electrolyte (7.9 mA cm(-2)).

It is the important issue to be improved in ZnO-based perovskite solar cell (PSC). In this paper, the core-shell structure of ZnO@TiO2 nanorod arrays (NRs) is designed as electron transport layer (ETL) for PSC. A novel synthesis of PSC based on ZnO@TiO2 NRs in ambient atmosphere was proposed. The photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of the core-shell device is 50.46% higher than that of common ZnO nanorod device. This is due to the improved interface contact between nanorods and perovskite layer, and the suppression of charge recombination. The PCE of the TiO2 modified device shows still more than 83% after 168 h, compared to that of the pristine one which decreased to less than 50%. This is due to TiO2 modification which can serve as a buffer layer to avoid direct contact between perovskite films and ZnO NRs, and inhibits the decomposition of perovskite film on ZnO NRs. Both theoretical calculation and Raman test result show that the interaction between CH3 NH3 PbI3 and TiO2 is mainly the bonding between I atoms of PbI2 slabs and Ti atoms of the TiO2 surface at PbI2/TiO2 interface.

Understanding their intrinsic material properties is critical to enhancing device performance and enabling innovative material and device designs. Here, we study lattice dynamics using far infrared (FIR) reflectance and photogenerated carrier dynamics using surface photovoltage (SPV) measurements on high-quality methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr(3)) single crystals. FIR reflectance shows three coherent infrared-active phonon modes between 40 and 200 cm(-1) that result in reststrahlen bands with much higher peak reflectance than has been previously reported. The phonon mode strength and damping are comparable to classical oxide perovskite single crystals. However, the effects of defects on photogenerated carrier recombination are still evident in SPV measurements. By performing SPV over different spectral ranges, we are able to separate the effects of surface and bulk defects on the recombination dynamics of photo generated charge carriers. We further apply SPV measurements to obtain the minority carrier (electron) diffusion length for the MAPbBr3 crystal. This study demonstrates that both FIR reflectance and SPV measurements provide useful information on the electromagnetic response properties of halide perovskite single crystals.

Generally, APbX(3) would decompose into AX and PbX2 at the early stage, when it is in a high-temperature environment. In this contribution, we demonstrated that pressure can reinforce the thermal stability of MAPbX(3), by promoting the reverse reaction. The stability reinforcement of MAPbI(3) by mechanical forces was found to be more effective compared with that of MAPbBr(3)/MAPbCl(3).

It is known that zinc oxide (ZnO) is one of the promising electron transporting layers for solar cells and is also applicable for flexible devices. However, the utilization of ZnO in PSCs is restricted due to its reactivity with the perovskite film during the annealing process. Here, we demonstrate improved photovoltaic performance and stability by introducing monolayer graphene (MLG) at the interface of the ZnO ETL and perovskite absorber, which results in a stable electric to power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.81%. The device based on this modified ETL maintains more than 80% of its initial PCE value after 300h under continuous illumination. Interestingly, we find that the presence of MLG at the ETL/perovskite interface not only improves the carrier extraction and photovoltaic properties but also protects the perovskite film from decomposition at elevated temperatures, which is beneficial for the stability of the device. To improve the stability even further, we have passivated the surface of the perovskite film by using a new modulator, i.e., 3-(pentafluorophenyl)-propionamide (PFPA) to abate the surface trap states of the perovskite. Based on our modification with MLG and PFPA, a stable PSC device with a PCE of 21% was achieved under AM 1.5G illumination with negligible hysteresis.

Compared with conventional energy conversion devices and energy storage devices that have limited performances, integration of the energy conversion devices and energy storage devices into a single unit is advantageous to present enhanced performance in multiple applications and satisfy commercial needs. However, further development of the integration relies on a deeper understanding of the interactions between the functional materials in the energy conversion devices and energy storage devices. In this study, we try to bridge the gap by investigating the interactions between the light absorbing halide perovskite material CH3NH3PbI3 and the lithium polysulfide intermediates (S-8, Li2S8, Li2S6, Li2S4, Li2S2, and Li2S) formed during the charging/discharging processes in lithium sulfur batteries via ab initio calculations. We find that the CH3NH3PbI3 and lithium polysulfide species have decent interactions, with the lithium polysulfide species residing stably on the halide perovskite surfaces and such interactions are strengthened by the charge transfer characters between the adsorbates and the adsorbents. We propose that the light absorbing halide perovskite materials represented by the CH3NH3PbI3 absorber exhibit potentials to be integrated into the lithium sulfur battery cathode to serve as an anchoring material to harness the solar power and mitigate the battery degradation problem, since the dissolution of intermediate lithium polysulfide (Li2Sn) is a severe problem in lithium sulfur batteries. The resulting integrated device is superior in capturing the solar energy due to the presence of the halide perovskite moiety and exhibits a large specific energy, low cost, and low toxicity due to the sulfur materials.

On the contrary, the kinetics related to a shorter-wavelength bleach band (similar to 480 nm) behave differently: a single-wavelength decay is sufficient to probe charge population. Moreover, both the shorter-wavelength excitation and higher pump pulse intensities result in significantly longer charge cooling times, which might be important in efficient hot carrier extraction.

Because of its complicated architecture, several of its technological, physical and geometrical issues have been examined many times.

For instance, these studies have not clarified the nature and type of hydrogen bonding and other noncovalent interactions involved; the origin of hysteresis; the actual role of the methylammonium cation; the nature of polarity associated with the tetragonal geometry; the unusual origin of various frontier orbital contributions to the conduction band minimum; the underlying phenomena of spin-orbit coupling that causes significant bandgap reduction; and the nature of direct-to-indirect bandgap transition features. Arising from many recent reports, it is now a common belief that the I center dot center dot center dot H-N interaction formed between the inorganic framework and the ammonium group of CH3NH3+ is the only hydrogen bonded interaction responsible for all temperature-dependent geometrical polymorphs of the system, including the most stable one that persists at low-temperatures, and the significance of all other noncovalent interactions has been overlooked. This study focussed only on the low temperature orthorhombic polymorph of CH3NH3 PbI3 and CD3ND3PbI3, where D refers deuterium. Together with QTAIM, DORI and RDG based charge density analyses, the results of density functional theory calculations with PBE with and without van derWaals corrections demonstrate that the prevailing view of hydrogen bonding in CH3NH3PbI3 is misleading as it does not alone determine the a(-)b(+)a(-) tilting pattern of the PbI64- octahedra. This study suggests that it is not only the I center dot center dot center dot H/D-N, but also the I center dot center dot center dot H/D-C hydrogen/deuterium bonding and other noncovalent interactions (viz. tetrel-, pnictogen- and lump-hole bonding interactions) that are ubiquitous in the orthorhombic CH3NH3PbI3/CD3ND3PbI3 perovskite geometry. Their interplay determines the overall geometry of the polymorph, and are therefore responsible in part for the emergence of the functional optical properties of this material. This study also suggests that these interactions should not be regarded as the sole determinants of octahedral tilting since lattice dynamics is known to play a critical role as well, a common feature in many inorganic perovskites both in the presence and the absence of the encaged cation, as in CsPbI3/WO3 perovskites, for example.",,,,"Varadwajt.okayama-u.ac.jp), Pradeep R./M-6198-2018","Varadwajt.okayama-u.ac.jp), Pradeep R./0000-0002-7102-3133",,,,,,,,,,,,2045-2322,,,,,10-Jan,2019,9,,,,,,,,50,10.1038/s41598-018-36218-1,,,,,,,,WOS:000455352400033,30631082,,,,

DBD treatment can promote the surface crystallization of the CH3NH3PbI3 film, increase the conductivity of CH3NH3PbI3 film, and manifest efficient defect passivation. In addition, DBD treatment can remove surface N-containing fragments of perovskite film to produce a lead-rich surface, which not only affords self-passivation effect but also increases the interactions at the perovskite/fullerene interface. Benefitting from the reduced defect density at the perovskite interface, the DBD-treated perovskite film can enable a similar to 12.5% enhancement in power conversion efficiency of the derived doped PC61BM-based perovskite solar cells. Such enhancement is mainly contributed from the improvement of open circuit voltage (from 0.885 to 0.922 V) and fill factor (0.698 to 0.759).

Here we report the fabrication of efficient and stable planar perovskite solar cells by interface engineering with p-type NiO nanocrystals. It is found that the photovoltaic performance of the devices is not so sensitive to the thickness of NiO thin films. The champion planar perovskite solar cell with a NiO thin film in the interface of perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD can achieve a high efficiency of 19.89% and a high steady-state power output of 19.37 mW cm(-2), being attributed to the significantly suppressed radiative recombination and eliminated charge accumulation. Moreover, the device shows excellent stability because its efficiency can retain 94.40% of the initial value after 400 h measurement in an air environment with 50 +/- 5% relative humidity.

However, the poor long-term stability and toxicity of Pb pose major setbacks to its commercialization. Theoretical calculations and experimental trail-and-error processes have recently aimed to find alternative perovskites, including inorganic halide perovskites (CsPbI3, CsPbIBr2, etc.), inorganic halide double perovskites (Cs2AgBiBr6, etc.), and chalcogenide single perovskites (BaZrS3, etc.). However, their material properties are inferior to hybrid perovskite in terms of cell performance and material toxicity. Here, a class of lead-free chalcogenide double perovskites A(2)M(III)M(V)X-6 [A = Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+; M(III) = Bi3+ or Sb3+; M(V) = V5+, Nb5+, Ta5+; X = S2-, Se2-] are comprehensively investigated with respect to its stability and electronic and optical properties. First-principles calculations on bandgaps, effective masses, optical absorption, and ideal power conversion efficiencies led to the selection of nine stable double chalcogenide perovskites that exhibit superior optoelectronic properties, i.e., quasi-direct bandgaps, balanced electron and hole effective masses, and strong optical absorption owing to the strong antibonding character both at the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM). Unfortunately, thermodynamic stability calculations on massive decomposition pathways show negative decomposition energies ranging from 0 (-0.37) to -66 meV/atom, indicating the difficulty for a thin-film phase. The most likely compound is Ba2BiNbS6, with its decomposition energies (0 and -22 meV/atom for P2(1)/n and R (3) over bar phases, respectively) within the computational errors, which may be further stabilized by the confinement effect in nanocrystal form.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0897-4756,1520-5002,,,,8-Jan,2019,31,1,,,,,244,250,,10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b04320,,,,,,,,WOS:000455558100026,,,,,

To improve light stability, removing the TiO2 layer from PSC devices is the best solution, but the photovoltaic conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the reported TiO2-layer-free PSCs are much lower than TiO2-layer-containing PSCs. As such, via applying a chemical engineering technique of inserting a layer of bathophenanthroline (Bphen) between the ITO substrate and the perovskite film, we developed a TiO2-layer-free PSC with both good light stability and an averaged PCE of around 18.53%, much higher than that of those reported ones. The insertion of the Bphen layer caused a dramatic promotion of shunt resistances (R-sh), causing the improvements of the open circuit voltages (V-oc), fill factors (FF), and PCE. Photoluminescence decay curves of perovskite films of various devices indicate that the Bphen layer leads to the enhancement of charge transport. It is the chief reason for the Bphen-layer-containing cells of structure 1 having a PCE as high as cells of structure 2 with blocking and mesoporous TiO2 layers. Stability tests show that the most significant role of the Bphen layer on the cell performance is the magnificent promotion of light stability.

Passivation of the defects is an effective method to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). To achieve stable passivation, the interaction between the perovskite and additive materials should be taken into consideration. In this work, we for the first time introduced carbon quantum dots (CQDs) as an additive for the stabilization of MAPbI(3)via passivation of the grain boundaries of the perovskite. Because the carboxylic groups, hydroxyl groups and amino-groups on the edge of CQDs can bond with the uncoordinated Pb in MAPbI(3), strong and stable interactions between the perovskite and CQDs can be generated, inducing a lower trap-state density and better optoelectronic properties. The typical PCE of the PSCs based on CQD modified MAPbI(3) films increases from 17.59% to 18.81% and the PCE of the optimized champion PSCs reaches 19.38%.

Organometallic halide perovskite solar cells have gradually demonstrated particular superior properties in energy field due to their excellent photoelectric properties. This has been triggered by the unprecedented increase in its overall power conversion efficiency reaching 23% in just a few years, and it is becoming a direct competitor against the existing leading technology silicon. In this paper, 5-AVA-doped organometal halide perovskite films, (5-AVA)( 0.05) (MA)(0. 95) PbI3 and (5-AVA)(0.05) (MA)(0.95) PbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD, are prepared by the two-step method. The generation and recombination mechanism of charge carriers in two kinds of film samples are discussed in detail. The bivalent band structure of perovskite film material CH3NH3PbI3 is determined by ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra of perovskite film (5-AVA)(0.05) (MA)(0.95)PbI3 and (5-AVA)(0.05)(MA)(0.95)PbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD. We investigate the photocarrier dynamics and band filling effects in these two organometal halide perovskite films by using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. For (5-AVA)(0.05) (MA)(0.95) PbI3 , the photoinduced bleach recovery at 760 nm reveals that band-edge recombination follows second-order kinetics, indicating that the dominant relaxation pathway is via the recombination of free electrons and holes. With regard to the perovskite film (5-AVA)(0.05) (MA)(0.95)PbI3 and (5-AVA)(0.05) (MA)(0.95)PbI3/SpiroOMeTAD, the signal is photoinduced absorption from 550 nm to 700 nm. As the delay time increases, the electrons and holes are recombined, which results in a red shift of absorption spectrum in (5-AVA)(0.05)(MA)(0.95)PbI3 . This can be referred to as Moss-Burstein band filling model. In contrast, the electrons and holes of (5-AVA)(0.05)(MA)(0.95)PbI3/SpiroOMeTAD perovskite film sample are separated after photoexcitation. The holes rapidly transfer to the hole transport layer of Spiro-OMeTAD. It will lead to an increase in sample absorbance and a rapid recovery of bleaching signals. Consequently, electron-hole recombination is no longer a dominant pathway to the relaxation of photocarriers and the band filling effect is not significant in the composite film Our findings provide a valuable insight into the understanding of the charge carrier dynamics and spectral band filling in mixed perovskites. These results conduce to the understanding of the intrinsic photo-physics of semiconducting organometal halide perovskites with direct implications for photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications, and provide a reference for the future research of perovskite solar cells.",,,,"Dai, Ye/G-8132-2011","Dai, Ye/0000-0002-9661-4626",,,,,,,,,,,,1000-3290,,,,,5-Jan,2019,68,1,,,,,,,18401,10.7498/aps.68.20181854,,,,,,,,WOS:000455408900025,,,,,

Independent on the ratio of the initial components (CH3NH3I:PbI2), the ratio between the content of lead and iodine in the films remains unchanged, that is why a significant difference in the film properties could be explained by the anisotropy of the particle shape, which is consistent with the data of electron microscopy and X-ray diffractometry.",,,,"Kobylianska, Sofia/N-5185-2019","Kobylianska, Sofia/0000-0002-3371-0629",,,,,,,,,,,,1556-276X,,,,,5-Jan,2019,14,,,,,,,,4,10.1186/s11671-018-2841-6,,,,,,,,WOS:000454932600001,30612275,,,,

Particularly, when the concentration of Gu-dopant for the perovskite film increases, the normal hysteresis initially observed in the pristine PSC is first suppressed with 2%-Gu-dopant, then changed to inverted hysteresis with a higher Gu-dopant. The hysteresis tunability behavior is attributed to the interplay of charge/ion accumulation and recombination at interfaces in the PSC.

Parameters, such as the total thickness, the roughness, and the crystallinity of the films, were examined. Differences in the grain size and in the crystal planes of the perovskite were observed and evaluated.

The ML algorithm uses GNU Octave to run a regularized logistic regression algorithm that classifies each pixel of an input image as part of an edge or not part of an edge. The basic features used for the algorithm are each pixel's grayscale intensity, its Sobel derivative. Higher order Sobel derivatives, higher degree polynomial terms, and intensities convolved by various kernels were used as additional features to improve the program's accuracy and true-positive rate. Training data is obtained by using non-ML Canny Edge Detection to annotate the edges an SFAI image of a pure perovskite solar cell (PSC). The classifier exhibits an 85.58% accuracy and produces an edge mask that clearly outlines the crystals visually. The ML edge mask exhibits far fewer false-positive mis-classifications for pixels in the middle of the crystals than Canny. However, the ML mask's edges are fainter, owing to a lower true-positive classification rate. Using more kernels. higher order derivatives. and higher degree polynomial terms all significantly increased the true positive rate of the classifier, leading to thicker edges.

In this study, an effective strategy for resolving this technical issue has been devised by proposing a simple but highly effective technique to fabricate an efficient, multilayer TiO2/Ag-(O)/ZnO (TAOZ) configuration. This configuration displays low losses in optical transmittance and electrical conductivity owing to its completely continuous, ultrathin metallic Ag-(O) transparent electrode, and any notable current leakage is suppressed by its pinhole-free TiO2 electron transport layer. These features are a direct consequence of the rapid evolution of Ag-(O) and TiO2 into ultrathin, completely continuous, pinhole-free layers owing to the dramatically improved wetting of metallic Ag-(O) with a minimal dose of oxygen (ca. 3 at%) during sputtering.

In this work, concerning two categories of configurations, p-CH3NH3PbI3 based hole transporting layer (HTL) free planar PSCs, as well as p-CH3NH3PbI3 based HTL-free and electron transporting layer (ETL) free planar PSCs were modeled and simulated by AFORS-HET software, and the performances of these PSCs were analyzed in detail. Several factors or parameters that influence the performance of PSCs were concerned in the models, such as interface defect layer, trap density of the perovskite layer, series resistance and shunt resistance. The yielded power conversion efficiency (PCE) of HTL-free PSCs with the configurations of ZnO:Al/ZnO/CH3NH3PbI3 and ZnO:Al/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 were 14.36% and 16.92%, respectively. Three transparent conductive oxide (TCO) materials, i.e. ZnO:Al, FTO and ITO, were directly combined with p-type CH3NH3PbI3 to form ZnO:Al/CH3NH3PbI3, FTO/CH3NH3PbI3 and ITO/CH3NH3PbI3 carrier transporting layer free PSCs, with the PCE up to 15.91%, 15.48% and 6.42%, respectively. This evaluation indicates the high performances of some both HTL-free and ETL-free, carrier transporting layer free, planar PSCs with TCO/perovskite heterojunctions, an extremely simple device structure. This could be because photo-generated carriers can be effectively separated by built-in electric field and transported from p-n heterojunctions to electrodes in TCO/CH3NH3PbI3 heterojunction solar cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0030-4026,,,,,,2019,179,,,,,,1019,1026,,10.1016/j.ijleo.2018.11.050,,,,,,,,WOS:000464491400133,,,,,

The averaged efficiency of MAPbI(3) solar cells using low-purity PbI2 is 14.16%, whereas that using high-purity PbI2 is 16.39%. Excitingly, the averaged efficiency of MAPbI(3) solar cells using low-purity PbI2 is boosted to 16.58% by adding a small amount of MACl into MAPbI(3) precursor, which is comparable to that from high-purity PbI2. Results from scanning electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction indicate that the morphologies and structures of MAPbI(3) thin films are not affected by the purity of PbI2 and the addition of small amount of Cl source. Further investigations using open-circuit voltage decay and admittance spectroscopy (AS) reveal that low purity of PbI2 leads to lower electron lifetime due to higher defect density, whereas the addition of Cl can suppress the defect density, resulting into higher electron lifetime. This discovery may offer a great opportunity for fabricating low-cost, high-efficiency perovskite solar cells using low-purity feedstocks, which would definitely expedite the development of environment-friendly perovskite solar cells.

Herein, we report our development of a low-temperature-gradient crystallization (LTGC) method for high-quality CH3NH3PbBr3 (MAPbBr(3)) perovskite single crystals with lateral dimension as large as two inches. The theoretical analysis suggests that a small temperature gradient should be used to restrain the growth condition, particularly the solution concentration, within the optimal single-crystal-growth (OSCG) zone. The solubility curve as a function of temperature reveals a sharp turning point at similar to 60 degrees C, across which the first-order solubility derivative (dC/dT) shows very different behaviors: below this temperature, the dC/dT changes dramatically as the temperature increases, while above this temperature, the dC/dT enters a plateau where further temperature change has little effect on the derivative, meaning that one can attain both a substantial crystal growth rate and crystallization yield below this temperature. Utilizing this discovery, a MAPbBr3 single crystal as large as 47 x 41 x 14 mm is obtained with high quality via the LTGC method. The single crystal exhibits the best optoelectronic quality among all MAPbBr3 materials reported in the literature, including the best trap state density, mobility, carrier lifetime, and diffusion length. These superior optoelectronic properties are further transferred into a high-performance planar photodetector. The device exhibits high operational stability, high external quantum efficiency (13,453%), excellent detectivity as high as 8 x 10(13) Jones, and a fast response speed as quick as 15.8 ls.

In this work, metal-NiO contacts have been investigated to indicate a novel route to choose proper metals in designing PSCs based on NiO as the HTM.

The toxicity of Pb is taken into account, and the Ge element can be used as a substitute element for Pb. Furthermore, we explore one of the perovskite materials, i.e., FA(0.75)Cs(0.25)Sn(0.25)Ge(0.75)I(3) whose photovoltaic properties are close to those of FA(0.75)Cs(0.25)Sn(0.5)Pb(0.5)I(3), but the former does not contain toxic atoms.

This method also allows for printing (patterning) of the perovskite on a desired area. The pre-annealed MAPbI(3) and -phase FAPbI(3) films were prepared by spin-coating DMSO and a polar aprotic solvent admixed precursor solution at 65 degrees C and 100 degrees C for about 1 min, respectively, to form adduct films containing DMSO. Two films were sandwiched without pressure by a method called bifacial stamping, and annealed at 100 degrees C for 9 min, which resulted in complete phase transition of FAPbI(3) and led to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.34%. The stamped MAPbI(3) demonstrated a PCE of 20.18% that was much higher than the conventionally annealed MAPbI(3) (approximate to 17.4%) mainly due to a much higher fill factor and open-circuit voltage. Optical and structural studies revealed that DMSO-mediated ion exchange plays a vital role in the phase transition of FAPbI(3) and the surface modification of MAPbI(3). Theoretical calculation results further support the role of DMSO in the phase transition at low temperature. Stamping was applied to EAPbI(3) (EA = ethylammonium), where photoinactive yellow EAPbI(3) changed to photoactive EAPbI(3) with a PCE of 13.02% after stamping with MAPbI(3). The DMSO-mediated EA/MA ion exchange reaction during the stamping process created a new layer having a gradient solid solution of EAPbI(3) and MAPbI(3), which was responsible for the abnormally high PCE of the EAPbI(3) based perovskite solar cell.

A model for coupled ion vacancy motion and charge transport is formulated and solved in a three-layer planar perovskite solar cell. Its results are used to demonstrate that the replacement of standard transport layer materials (spiro-OMeTAD and TiO2) by materials with lower permittivity and/or doping leads to a shift in the scan rates at which hysteresis is most pronounced to rates higher than those commonly used in experiment. These results provide a cogent explanation for why organic electron transport layers can yield seemingly hysteresis-free devices but which nevertheless exhibit hysteresis at low temperature. In these devices the decrease in ion vacancy mobility with temperature compensates for the increase in hysteresis rate with use of low permittivity/doping organic transport layers. Simulations are used to classify features of the current-voltage curves that distinguish between cells in which charge carrier recombination occurs predominantly at the transport layer interfaces and those where it occurs predominantly within the perovskite. These characteristics are supplemented by videos showing how the electric potential, electronic and ionic charge profiles evolve across a planar perovskite solar cell during a current-voltage scan. Design protocols to mitigate the possible effects of high ion vacancy distributions on cell degradation are discussed.

The occupancy of the doped metals in the lattice is confirmed by XRD, EDX, and XPS. The Mg doping increases the band gap of TiO2 while the Al doping decreases it. The wide band gap in Mg doped TiO2 reduces the electron and hole recombination rate, thus increasing the J(SC) and V-OC.

Two small organic molecules, each with a different backbone, 3-aminopropanoic acid (APA) and 4-aminobenzoic acid (ABA), were selected and their solvation effects were also investigated. Small homogeneously distributed cracks were found in the PbI2 film produced from the modification with APA molecules in demethyl sulfoxide or ethanol solution, whereas films produced from modification with ABA molecules showed different effects. These small cavities act as pathway for MAI intercalation and facilate PbI2-to-MAPbI(3) conversion, leading to PbI2-free perovskite film. The different morphologies were caused by different adsorption behaviors of each SAM on the TiO2 surface. APA molecules interact with the hydroxyl groups of TiO2 while ABA molecules do not. Therefore, with APA treatment, the perovskite solar cells showed improvements in power conversion efficiency in comparison to either the devices without surface modification or ones treated with ABA molecules.

Lead intensity in LHP-PV life cycles can be 4 times lower and potential toxic emissions can be 20 times lower than those in representative U.S. electricity mixes, assuming that PV operational lifetimes reach 20 years. We introduce the metric ""toxicity potential payback time"", accounting for toxic emissions in the life cycle of energy cycles, and showed that it is < 2 years for perovskite PVs produced by and displacing the same grid mix. The toxicity potential associated with the energy of manufacturing a PV system dominates that associated with release of embodied lead. Therefore, the use of lead should not preclude commercialization of LHP-PVs. Instead, effort should focus on development of low-energy manufacturing processes and long service lifetimes.

We design and fabricate high-phase-purity, single-crystalline, highly conductive, and low temperature (<180 degrees C)-processed brookite-based TiO2 heterophase junctions on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) as the substrate. We test and compare single-phase anatase (A) and brookite (B) and heterophase anatase brookite (AB) and brookite-anatase (BA) as ETLs in PSCs. The power-conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs with low-temperature-processed single-layer FTO-B as the ETL were as high as 14.92%, which is the highest reported efficiency of FTO-B-based single-layer PSC. This implies that FTO-B serves as an active phase and can be a potential candidate as an n-type ETL scaffold in planar PSCs. Moreover, the surface of highly crystalline brookite TiO2 exhibits a tendency toward interparticle necking, leading to the formation of compact scaffolds. Furthermore, PSCs with heterophase junction FTO-AB ETLs exhibited PCEs as high as 16.82%, which is superior to those of PSCs with single-phase anatase (FTO-A) and brookite (FTO-B) as the ETLs (13.86% and 14.92%, respectively). In addition, the PSCs with FTO-AB exhibited improved efficiency and decreased hysteresis compared with those with FTO-BA (13.45%) due to the suitable band alignment with the perovskite layer, which resulted in superior photogenerated charge-carrier extraction and reduced charge accumulation at the interface between the heterophase junction and perovskite.

In this study, a cerium doping method was adopted in mesoporous TiO2, which was prepared via a traditional one-step hydrothermal process, to improve its electron transport properties by recombining nanocrystals and optimizing the negative flat band potential of TiO2. Continuous, aligned and regulated recombined crystals of mesoporous TiO2 were obtained with optimized pathways of electron transport from the ETL to the FTO layer. Moreover, a small amount of Ti4+ ions was replaced by Ce4+ ions in the TiO2 lattice, which led to deformation of the TiO2 lattice and influenced the growth process of TiO2 grains. With an optimized mole proportion of Ce element in the TiO2 precursor, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells was typically boosted to 17.75% in comparison with 15.92% in the case of undoped TiO2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2046-2069,,,,,,2019,9,2,,,,,1075,1083,,10.1039/c8ra07800a,,,,,,,,WOS:000455494200057,,,,,

Thus, new, cost-effective and easy to synthesize small organic molecules is still required. As reported, a carbazole-based compound (R01) was synthesized using a simple two steps method from low-cost commercially available compounds and used as an HTM. R01 exhibited higher conductivity and hole-mobility compared to that of the Spiro-OMeTAD. PSCs fabricated with R01 produced a power conversion efficiency of 12.03%, equivalent to that obtained in devices where Spiro-OMeTAD was the HTM. These findings highlighted R01 as a highly promising HTM with high performance, facile synthesis, and low cost. From a structural perspective, methoxy groups (-OCH3) in the HTM structure are controlling the HOMO level of the compound, apart from the critical role they play in anchoring the material onto the core perovskite layer. In this paper, we report a systematic study of the electronic structures and photophysical properties of twelve designed derivatives of R01. R01 was modified by substituting some hydrogen in the carbazole rings by two, four and six methoxy groups at different positions. The ground and excited state geometries are optimized by applying density functional theory (DFT) and its time-dependent functional (TDDFT), respectively. Detailed investigation of two factors: (i) the number and (ii) position of methoxy groups on the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs), absorption and emission wavelengths, ionization potential, electron affinity, reorganization energies and charge mobility are examined and discussed. The electro-optical and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties are finely tuned in the R01 derivatives. By incorporating methoxy substituents into this carbazole-based compound, systematic design of potential materials for PSCs can be feasible. (C) 2018 The Authors.

In this study, a promising solution-processed ICL consisting of cross-linked p-doped hole transport layer (HTL) and n-doped fullerene electron transport layer for efficient and stable monolithic perovskite tandem solar cells is demonstrated. For the first time, high-performance photo-cross-linkable p-doped HTL material based on poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) is developed by incorporating 1,2-bis[4-(azido-methyl)phenyl]-1,2-diphenylethene (TPE-MN3) and molybdenum tris-[1-(trifluoroethanoyl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)ethane-1,2-dithiolene] (Mo(tfdCOCF(3))(3)) as the cross-linking agent and p-type dopant, respectively. This HTL exerts multiple positive impact on the device characteristics, including good solvent resistance, appropriate energy level matching, good electrical conductivity, and high compatibility with different perovskite systems. With these desirable characteristics, the series-connected tandem solar cells afford a PCE up to 18.69%, which represents the highest efficiency reported to date for monolithic all-perovskite tandem cells. Additionally, owing to high conductivity of the interfacial layers, a promising PCE up to 16.20% is attained even when the active area is extended to 1.2 cm(2). More encouragingly, the encapsulated tandem cells exhibit remarkable long-term stability, maintaining approximate to 91% of its initial PCE after 9300 h (approximate to 387 days) of air exposure.

However, the poor stability of organic lead halide perovskites (APbX(3), A: organic cations; X: halide anions) hinders their practical application. Compositional engineering, optimizing the concentration of different A and/or X, is one of the most effective ways to enhance the stability of APbX(3). In particular, mixing formamidinium (FA) and methylammonium (MA) cations has been widely investigated. Here, we performed first-principles calculations to systematically investigate the structures and optical properties of FA(1-x)MA(x)PbI(3). We obtained several stable crystal structures of FA(1-x)MA(x)PbI(3) in the cubic phase for different ratios of FA and MA cations. By analyzing the structures of these mixed cation perovskites, we revealed that the lattice parameters decreased linearly with increasing concentration of MA cations, which was consistent with previous experimental results. For APbX(3) perovskites, the Goldschmidt tolerance factor has been shown to be an effective index for predicting the stability. The mixing of organic cations is an effective method for adjusting this factor and thus the stability of these perovskite materials. In this work, the formation energy difference (Delta E) was calculated and our results showed that mixing of FA and MA cations could increase the thermodynamic stability compared to pure FAPbI(3) and MAPbI(3). FA(0.5)MA(0.5)PbI(3) was found to be the most stable of all composites investigated. Furthermore, the band gap decreased with increasing proportion of FA cations, indicating an effective strategy for extending the absorption range of organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites into the infra-red region of the solar spectrum. By analyzing the Pb-I bond lengths for different FA : MA ratios, we showed that the decrease of band gap mainly comes from the increase of the maximum valence band energy. In addition, the effective masses were similar, irrespective of the cation mixture, indicating that the mixing of organic cations does not affect the carrier transport mechanism in this material. Density of states (DOS) analysis revealed that the DOS of valence band edge increased with increasing proportion of FA cations, enhancing transitions between the valence and conduction bands. Finally, detailed analysis of the optical absorption coefficients of all composition was performed; the absorption spectra were blue shifted with increasing MA cation concentration. These results demonstrated the possibility of controlling the optoelectronic properties of organometallic lead halide perovskites by mixing FA and MA cations and hence, further improving the efficiency of perovskite solar cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1000-6818,,,,,JAN,2019,35,1,,,,,69,75,,10.3866/PKU.WHXB201801082,,,,,,,,WOS:000439167900013,,,,,

With only several years of development, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has increased from 3.8% to 22.7%. In general, PSCs have two types of structural architecture: mesoporous and planar. The latter possesses higher potential for commercialization due to its simpler structure and fabrication process, especially the inverted planar structure, which possesses negligible hysteresis. In an inverted PSC, the electron transport materials (ETM) are deposited on a perovskite film. Only a few ETMs can be used for inverted PSCs as the perovskite film is easily damaged by the solvent used to dissolve the ETM. Furthermore, the energy levels of the ETM should be well aligned with that of the perovskites. Normally it is difficult to use inorganic ETMs as they require high temperatures for the annealing process to improve the electron conductivity; the perovskite film cannot sustain these high temperatures. To date, the fullerene derivative, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), is the most commonly used organic ETM for high efficiency inverted planar PSCs. However, the high manufacturing cost due to its complex synthesis retards the industrialization of the PSCs. Here, we introduce a fullerene pyrrolidine derivative, N-methyl-2-pentyl-[60]fullerene pyrrolidine (NMPFP), synthesized via the Prato reaction of C-60 directly with cheap hexanal and sarcosine. Then the NMPFP electron transport layer (ETL) was prepared by a simple solution process. The properties of the resulting NMPFP ETLs were characterized using UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry measurements, atomic force microscopy, and conductivity test. From the results of the UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry measurements, the LUMO level of NMPFP ETL was calculated to be 0.2 eV higher than that of the PCBM ETL. This contributes to a higher open-circuit photovoltage. In addition, the NMPFP film presented higher conductivity than the PCBM film. Thus, the photo-generated charge carriers in the perovskite films should be transported more efficiently to the NMPFP electron transport layer (ETL) than to the PCBM ETL. This was confirmed by the results of the steady-state photoluminescence spectroscopy. Finally, the NMPFP as an alternative low-cost ETL was employed in an inverted planar PSC to evaluate the device performance. The device made with the NMPFP ETL yielded an efficiency of 13.83% with negligible hysteresis, which is comparable to the PCBM counterpart devices. Moreover, since stability is another important parameter retarding the commercialization of PSCs, the stability of the PCBM and NMPFP base PSCs were investigated and compared. It was found that the NMPFP devices possessed significantly improved stability due to the higher hydrophobicity of the NMPFP. In conclusion, this research demonstrates that NMPFP is a promising ETL to replace PCBM for the industrialization of cheap, efficient and stable inverted planar PSCs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1000-6818,,,,,,2019,35,4,,,,,401,407,,10.3866/PKU.WHXB201803131,,,,,,,,WOS:000447761900012,,,,,

These SnO2 microspheres have high specific surface area, excellent crystallinity and tunable building units.

The sizes of primary nanocrystals slightly increase with the adscititious water. The SnO2 microspheres exhibit large specific surface areas, leading to efficient sensitizer-loading in both dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The sub-micron-sized microspheres could also enhance the light-harvesting of the solar cells due to their light-scattering capability. As the primary nanocrystal multiply contacts densely to neighbouring grains, such intergrowth would improve the electron transport through the grain boundaries.

Herein we report on a comparative investigation of electron beam irradiation effects on (all-inorganic) CsPbI3 and (organic-inorganic hybrid) CH3NH3PbI3 halide perovskite thin films by transmission electron microscopy. Upon continuous electron beam irradiation with high dose rates, CsPbI3 exhibits rather rapid morphological change and compositional degradation within irradiated regions, which are attributed to the radiolysis effect and probably assisted by electron beam heating and Coulomb forces. In contrast, for the freestanding, polycrystalline CH3NH3PbI3 thin films, significant structural damage mainly occurs on/outside the periphery of the irradiated regions, while, within the irradiated areas, the structural configurations appear rather intact. The electron beam induced electric field effect is suggested to be the primary reason for the unusual damage phenomenon. The building up of induced electrical fields in CH3NH3PbI3 is probably pertinent to its some unusual structural properties (e.g., rotational dynamics of organic cations), but should be also promoted by the unavoidable modifications of physical properties during the film preparation and electron beam focusing.

Yet, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of polycrystalline (3D) CsPbBr3 based PeLEDs needs further improvement. The low efficiency was attributed to severe luminescence quenching at PEDOT:PSS (Poly-(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate))/ CsPbBr3 interface arising from (i) interfacial energy barrier between PEDOT:PSS and CsPbBr3 layer, (ii) poor crystallization and large pinholes in perovskite film, and (iii) indium fin oxide (ITO) anode etching due to PEDOT:PSS acidity. Therefore, it is necessary to address all these problems simultaneously to reduce the luminescence quenching and to improve device efficiency. Here, we introduce a feasible approach to modify the PEDOT:PSS layer in order to reduce the luminescence quenching at PEDOT:PSS/CsPbBr3 interface. In this modification, PEDOT:PSS is mixed with a MoO3 ammonia solution at desired volume ratios. Our studies demonstrate that upon this treatment, not only hole injection and crystallization of perovskite film are improved but also ITO is protected from etching by the acidic nature of PEDOT:PSS. This modification result in a high performance all inorganic CsPbBr3 LED with a maximum luminance of similar to 34420 cd/m(2) and a current efficiency of similar to 7.30 cd/A.

However, it still remains a huge challenge to integrate fragile perovskite films into a monolithic tandem structure. We have for the first time addressed the challenge of preparing stable and efficient tandem solar cells combining PbS colloidal QDs with emerging MAPbI(3) perovskites by all-solution-processing. A perfectly superimposed open circuit voltage and an optimal power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.03% have been achieved, which is the highest reported PCE for any PbS QD based tandem solar cell.

In addition, the introduction of a PbS subcell can effectively eliminate the hysteresis-effect in metal-halide perovskites, and result in high UV stability and exceptional storage stability under a dry environment without encapsulation. Therefore, we revealed that the synergetic use of QDs and perovskite materials in tandem structures can extend the range of device photo response and simultaneously deliver excellent device performance as well as improved stability.

The biggest factor limiting progress is the inability to identify grain boundaries. Noncrystallographic techniques can misidentify grain boundaries, leading to conflicting literature reports about their influence; however, the gold standard - electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) - destroys halide perovskite thin films. Here, this problem is solved by using a solid-state EBSD detector with 6000 times higher sensitivity than the traditional phosphor screen and camera. Correlating true grain size with photoluminescence lifetime, carrier diffusion length, and mobility shows that grain boundaries are not benign but have a recombination velocity of 1670 cm s(-1), comparable to that of crystalline silicon. Amorphous grain boundaries are also observed that give rise to locally brighter photoluminescence intensity and longer lifetimes.

Therefore, it is desirable to design new structured PSCs with stable HTMs presenting excellent carrier extraction and transfer properties. This work demonstrates a new inverted PSC configuration. The new PSC has a graded band alignment and bilayered inorganic HTMs (i.e., compact NiOx and mesoporous CuGaO2). In comparison with planar-structured PSCs, the mesoporous CuGaO2 can effectively extract holes from perovskite due to the increased contact area of the perovskite/HTM. The graded energy alignment constructed in the ultrathin compact NiOx, mesoporous CuGaO2, and perovskite can facilitate carrier transfer and depress charge recombination. As a result, the champion device based on the newly designed mesoscopic PSCs yields a stabilized efficiency of approximate to 20%, which is considered one of the best results for inverted PSCs with inorganic HTMs. Additionally, the unencapsulated PSC device retains more than 80% of its original efficiency when subjected to thermal aging at 85 degrees C for 1000 h in a nitrogen atmosphere, thus demonstrating superior thermal stability of the device.

However, instability of the 3D perovskite is the main challenge for industrialization. Incorporation of some long organic cations into perovskite crystal to terminate the lattice, and function as moisture and oxygen passivation layer and ion migration blocking layer, is proven to be an effective method to enhance the perovskite stability. Unfortunately, this method typically sacrifices charge-carrier extraction efficiency of the perovskites. Even in 2D-3D vertically aligned heterostructures, a spread of bandgaps in the 2D due to varying degrees of quantum confinement also results in charge-carrier localization and carrier mobility reduction. A trade-off between the power conversion efficiency and stability is made. Here, by introducing 2D C6H18N2O2PbI4 (EDBEPbI4) microcrystals into the precursor solution, the grain boundaries of the deposited 3D perovskite film are vertically passivated with phase pure 2D perovskite.

In SnO2-based PSCs, nonradiative recombination sites at the SnO2-perovskite interface lead to a large potential loss and performance variation in the resulting photovoltaic devices. Here, a novel SnO2-in-polymer matrix (i.e., polyethylene glycol) is devised as the electron transporting layer to improve the film quality of the SnO2 electron transporting layer. The SnO2-in-polymer matrix is fabricated through spin-coating a polymer-incorporated SnO2 colloidal ink. The polymer is uniformly dispersed in SnO2 colloidal ink and promotes the nanoparticle disaggregation in the ink. Owing to polymer incorporation, the compactness and wetting property of SnO2 layer is significantly ameliorated.

As an efficient and promising electron-transporting material, ZnO has attracted much attention recently, while the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ZnO-based PSCs is still inferior to that of TiO2-based PSCs. In this work, we demonstrate that the Au nanorod (NR) suspension spin-coated at the interface between the electron transport layer (ETL) and the perovskite layer provides both plasmon enhancement and solvent annealing effects. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) offers strong light absorption over almost the whole visible-light range. Meanwhile, plasmon-induced hot electrons transferring from Au NRs to the ZnO film result in reduced trap-state density, restrained charge recombination, and efficient electron transport in the ETL, which could suppress photocurrent hysteresis to some extent. Interestingly, the introduction of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), which is originally used for dispersing Au NRs, yields a high-quality perovskite film. As a result, the PCE of our champion cell with the structure of FTO/ZnO/Au NRs/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au surges to 16.51% from 14.47%. Moreover, the devices show an excellent environmental stability, where the average PCEs can be maintained at about 90% of their original value after storing for as long as two months (>1400 h) under air conditions.

Importantly, the PSC performance does not change greatly with the concentration of LD29 regardless of whether the dopants are used, which has the potential to further reduce material usage. The device employing LD29 also shows comparable stability to that employing spiro-OMeTAD.

Due to their excellent optical properties, two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides (2D-TMDs) have recently been explored. Another promising class of materials to platform efficient PVs is organic-inorganic perovskites.

Despite that pump-probe spectroscopy measurements were carried out with a similar to 45 fs temporal resolution, the CT dynamics were not captured. A comparison of the ultrafast dynamics of the two band-edge excitons of the charge donor (2D-WS2) suggested that electron transfer is the dominant pathway of CT.

Accordingly, photoluminescence (PL) spectra are observed at 540, 560/610, and 735/790 nm, respectively. In such gradient bandgap structures, photogenerated carriers can effectively transfer and emit in the low-bandgap region by energy funneling. With illumination, the PL spectrum of Br-rich phase exhibits blueshift and therefore 610 nm band disappears. In contrast, redshift is observed in I-rich phase due to the decrease of 735 nm band while an increase of 790 nm band. It is demonstrated that irreversible and stable phases are formed with illumination in both Br-rich and I-rich nanoplatelets.

These differently sintered layers were used as the compact hole blocking layers in dye-sensitized and perovskite solar cells systems, keeping all other processes of cells preparation below 150 degrees C (including mesoporous oxides layers), simulating thus the low-T processes. Some jumps of blocking layer parameters found within sintering are related to a step increase of the efficiency of dye-senzitized cells at 150 degrees C, that can be useful in the low-temperature process, e.g. if TiAcAc is used as a binder of nanoparticles. However, deeper structural changes of the layers leading to higher efficiency were found out just above 350 degrees C. It is caused primarily by too high series resistances of low-T blocking layers that are very amorphous. So the addition of more conductive (anatase) nanoparticles into the blocking layer is much demanded.

The Rb in the quadruple-cation perovskite is found to segregate when the film undergoes aging under simultaneous light and heat exposure. More importantly, the PTAA layer prevents diffusion of gold into the perovskite layer when aged at 85 degrees C in the dark, but not under light. As a result, the PSCs thermally aged under light degrade much more severely than cells thermally aged in the dark. Therefore, the term Light and elevated Temperature Induced Degradation (LeTID) is introduced for PSCs.

Relatively high efficiency over 17% with less J-V hysteresis has been achieved by optimizing the precursor solution, spin rate, annealing temperature and UV ozone treatment time. The results indicate low temperature solution deposited Nb2O5 film can be a low cost and easy-prepared ETL material for high performance PSC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0927-0248,1879-3398,,,,15-Dec,2018,188,,,,,,66,72,,10.1016/j.solmat.2018.08.020,,,,,,,,WOS:000449239900008,,,,,

We demonstrate that a small amount of 1,6-DD affects the crystallization dynamic, yielding ideal perovskite film with enhanced crystallinity and enlarged grain size. The two terminal -NH3+ groups passivates the vacancy defects at the perovskite crystal surface, suppressing charge recombination and facilitating charge transportation effectively. Meanwhile, adjacent crystal surfaces are linked through the hexane alkyl chain of 1,6-DD molecule, which enhances the interaction between perovskite grains and anchors the microstructure of perovskite to some degree. Hydrophobic hexane alkyl chains also increase the moisture resistance of perovskite film.

The additives concentration in anti-solution is optimized to form a mixed layer where spiro-OMeTAD is dispersive in upper perovskite films with a vertical gradient, and a capping layer with appropriate thickness. The incorporation of spiro-OMeTAD in anti-solution tremendously improve the crystallinity of perovskite films while the graded heterojunction and the derived capping layer contribute to reduced interfacial losses. Moreover, poly(methyl methacrylate) as the second additive in anti-solution further passivates defects in perovskite films.

Significant inroads have been made into understanding this fact in terms of rapid ion migration, now a well-established property of the prototype photovoltaic perovskite MAPbI(3) and strongly implicated in the newer mixed compositions. Here, we study the manifestations of ion migration in frequency-domain small-signal measurements, focusing on the popular technique of Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). We provide new interpretations for a variety of previously puzzling features, including giant photoinduced low-frequency capacitance and negative capacitance in a variety of forms. We show that these apparently strange measurements can be rationalized by the splitting of AC current into two components, one associated with charge-storage and the other with the quasi-steady-state recombination current of electrons and holes. The latter contribution to the capacitance can take either a positive or a negative sign and is potentially very large when slow, voltage-sensitive processes such as ion migration are at play. Using numerical drift-diffusion semiconductor models, we show that giant photoinduced capacitance, inductive loop features, and low-frequency negative capacitance all emerge naturally as consequences of ion migration via its coupling to quasi-steady-state electron and hole currents. In doing so, we unify the understanding of EIS measurements with the comparably well-developed theory of rate dependent current-voltage (I-V) measurements in perovskite cells. Comparing the two techniques, we argue that EIS is more suitable for quantifying I-V hysteresis than conventional methods based on I-V sweeps and demonstrate this application on a variety of cell types.

We find that individual grains which do not have the ideal ABX(3) stoichiometry degrade faster than stoichiometric grains. We also observe that the degradation pathways depend on the local stoichiometry. Non-stoichiometric grains (with excess MAI) degrade from the centre of the grain and further degradation moves towards the grain boundary, whereas in stoichiometric grains degradation sets in at the grain boundary. We further use deliberately high doses of electron beam exposure to highlight the presence of local non-stoichiometry in device cross-sections of bias degraded devices which pinpoints different onset locations of degradation, depending on the local stoichiometry.

Ionic migration comes from the migration of halogen from lattice points to halogen vacancies. Considering the strong built-in potential located at the interface between perovskite and carrier transport layers, here we propose that it is the ionic migration at the interfacial depletion region that dominates device hysteresis. The most effective way to achieve hysteresis-free devices is to passivate ionic migration at the interface rather than within perovskite films. We utilized Cs4SnO4 as a modification layer, which could effectively suppress the defects at the interface and thus eliminate hysteresis, as well as shift the conduction band of perovskite/SnO2 closer and decrease the band misalignment. In addition, the partial diffusion of Cs+ into (FAPbI(3))(0.85)(MAPbBr(3))(0.15) is beneficial for phase stability toward long-term light illumination.

Passivation via post-treatment can heal these defects, but present methods are slightly destructive to the bulk of 3D perovskite due to the solvent effect, which hinders fabrication reproducibility. Herein, nondestructive surface/interface passivation using 4-fluoroaniline (FAL) is established. FAL is not only an effective antisolvent candidate for surface modification, but also a large dipole molecule (2.84 Debye) with directional field for charge separation. Density functional theory calculation reveals that the nondestructive properties are attributed to both the conjugated amine in aromatic ring and the para-fluoro-substituent. A hot vapor assisted colloidal process is employed for the post-treatment. The molecular passivation yields an ultrathin protection layer with a hydrophobic fluoro-substituent tail and thus enhances the stability and optoelectronic properties. FAL post-treated perovskite solar cell (PSC) delivers a 20.48% power conversion efficiency under ambient conditions.

Herein, a strategy for defect passivation of perovskite films via metal ion Ni2+ is for the first time reported. It is found that addition of Ni2+ can significantly generate polyporous Pbl(2) films due to a different solubility between NiCl2 and Pbl(2) which benefits penetration of MAI and thus formation of large grain perovskite films eventually. It further demonstrated that Ni2+ ions can effectively passivate Pbl(3)(-) antisite defects and restrain the generation of Pb-0 by interacting with the under-coordinated halide anions and halide-rich antisites. Therefore, introducing moderate Ni2+ ions result in a significant increase in photoluminescence lifetime from 285 to 732 ns.

Although the polymer blend systems systematically alter the morphology by creating small grains (more grain boundaries), they reduce nonradiative recombination within the film and enhance its spatial homogeneity of radiative recombination. We attribute this to a reduction in the density of bulk trap states, as evidenced by an order of magnitude higher photoluminescence intensity and a significantly higher open-circuit voltage when the polymer is incorporated into the perovskite films.

This comment addresses the challenges in solution processable photovoltaic technologies faced by scientists and engineers in addressing these questions, and highlights the concept of thick junctions as a promising solution.",,,,,"Meredith, Paul/0000-0002-9049-7414",,,,,,,,,,,,2041-1723,,,,,10-Dec,2018,9,,,,,,,,5261,10.1038/s41467-018-05514-9,,,,,,,,WOS:000452633700001,30532028,,,,

This NPFS-PSC is prepared with different structural depths (100, 150, and 200 nm) using both self-assembly and sphere lithography techniques. As determine through the optical and electrical analysis of different PSC devices, the NPFS-PSCs not only display the enhanced light absorption (due to the 2D diffraction grating) but also improve the electron collection efficiency by increasing the FTO/electron transport layer (ETL) and ETL/perovskite effective interface area. Compared to a planar PSC, the photocurrent density of the 200 nm etched NPFS-PSC is enhanced from 19.27 to 23.81 mA cm(-2) leading to an increase in the PCE from 14.21% to 17.85%. These results indicate that introducing the NPFS into the TiO2-based PSC can improve both light absorption ability and electron extraction and, therefore, represents a novel, promising, high-performance photovoltaic device.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2196-7350,,,,,7-Dec,2018,5,23,,,,,,,1801118,10.1002/admi.201801118,,,,,,,,WOS:000454229900009,,,,,

X-ray photoemission spectroscopy measurements show that within 10 h of illumination, about half of the initial C, N, and Br elemental concentrations leave the surface and about half of the perovskite's Pb is converted into metallic Pb. Light exposures while in the UHV system also significantly roughen the surface, and surprisingly, empty voids form approximate to 1 to 3 mu m down in the light exposed region. A framework based on the Kirkendall effect is put forward to explain the observed void formation. This proposed model may be relevant to the slow degradation of perovskite solar cells, which is sometimes attributed to irreversible chemical reactions from undesired diffusion. These measurements and observations reveal the intrinsic behavior of the CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystals under light illumination while in a UHV system where volatile species are free to leave, in contrast to existing device studies on the photostability of perovskite solar cells.",,,,"Gao, Yongli/N-8392-2015","Gao, Yongli/0000-0001-9765-5246; Huang, Jinsong/0000-0002-0509-8778",,,,,,,,,,,,2196-7350,,,,,7-Dec,2018,5,23,,,,,,,1801206,10.1002/admi.201801206,,,,,,,,WOS:000454229900015,,,,,

In hybrid double layer, a-TiO2 plays a role about efficient electron selective contact with perovskite material, while PC60 BM help electrons to rapidly extract from perovskite layers. From this new concept of configuration, it is possible to achieve not only high power conversion efficiencies but also low hysteretic behaviors in terms of current-voltage sweep direction. These enhanced characteristics are verified with photoluminescence and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic measurements. With such high efficiency and nonhysteretic perovskite solar cells, it is able to fabricate extremely high-efficiency flexible perovskite solar cells which can be compared with the world's highest-efficiency flexible perovskite devices.",,,,,"Jung, Hyun Suk/0000-0002-7803-6930",,,,,,,,,,,,2196-7350,,,,,7-Dec,2018,5,23,,,,,,,1800993,10.1002/admi.201800993,,,,,,,,WOS:000454229900004,,,,,
