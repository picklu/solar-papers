In this study, partially iodide-substituted MAPbBr(3) perovskites were prepared through a halide-exchange reaction in the liquid phase, and in situ space and time-resolved photoluminescence profiles were acquired by means of confocal microscopy. The rates of charge transfer from the bulk MAPbBr(3) to the surface MAPbBr(3-x)I(x) domains, which are widely distributed over a single crystal, were found to greatly depend on the excitation-power density. In particular, an abnormally slow charge-transfer process, lasting a few nanoseconds, was observed at higher excitation density. To explain the dependence of this rate on the excitation density, and its correlation with the charge-trapping rate in the bulk MAPbBr(3), we propose a plausible mechanism in which trap filling associated with surface-trapped holes induces band bending within the space charge region. This band bending modulates carrier dynamics near the surface, thereby leading to efficient charge extraction from the bulk. To validate the mechanism, the carrier dynamics was numerically simulated using a diffusion model that includes the effect of the localized electric field.

In comparison to CsPbBr3 QDs that display green emission, CsPbCI3 QDs with blue light emission contain more defects in the material and exhibit lower fluorescence quantum yield and device service time, which is the bottleneck in realizing blue, green, and red three-base coloured perovskite QD-based LEDs. It is therefore a pressing issue to develop other techniques instead of anion exchange to adjust the light emission of CsPbX3 and simultaneously enhance the stability of the nanocrystals, especially for blue emission. In this work, CsPbBr3 QDs compounded with CsPb2Br5 (CsPbBr3-CsPb2Br5 QDs) with stable blue and green emissions are obtained using improved one-step solution-phase method. CsPb2Br5 can enhance the luminescent colour and structural stability of CsPbBr3 QDs. CsPbBr(3-)CsPb(2)B(r)5 QDs showed greater stability than pure CsPbBr3 QDs in various environments. Moreover, CsPbBr3-CsPb2Br5 QDs are smaller than CsPbBr3 QDs synthesized at the same temperature, which results in blue-shift of the photoluminescence spectra. Owing to the strong stability, their photoluminescence emission peak can be simply and reliably tuned continuously between 480 nm and 520 nm through the reaction temperature.

In this paper, lead acetate was introduced into stoichiometric lewis acid-base perovskite precursor to prepare high-quality methylammonium lead halide (MAPbI(3)) perovskite films. The trace lead acetate can facilitate the perovskite crystallization and induce grain size growth. After introducing lead acetate, the perovskite films show higher photoluminescence intensity and longer carrier lifetime due to less traps and defects, which is attributed to the improved film properties. The impedance spectroscopy measurements reveal that the lead acetate can decrease the series resistance and recombination resistance in the perovskite solar cells. As a result, the perovskite solar cells with lead acetate achieve an improved average efficiency of 18.06% (18.86% of best efficiency) compared with 16.87% of average efficiency of the control samples without lead acetate, while the hysteresis behavior is also significantly suppressed with the lead acetate.

As a crucial first step to address this issue, we performed density functional theory calculations to evaluate the electronic structure of the energetically favored (110) perovskite surface in the presence of the widely reported IPb antisite defects. Our calculations indicate that the nature of trap states formed is different for the perovskite surface with exposed methylammonium (MAI) and lead iodide (PbI2) terminating groups. While, in MAI terminated surfaces, IPb antisite defects lead to shallow states close to the valence band, both deep and shallow states are created in the bandgap region in the PbI2 terminated surface. Furthermore, we determined contribution from individual atoms to the trap states and inferred that the trap states originate from the clusters of iodine atoms that are formed near the defect site. The exact nature of the defect state is strongly correlated with the atomic structure of these clusters and can be potentially tuned by controlling the processing conditions of the perovskite film.

Increasing Br content widened the bandgap of perovskite (i.e., blue shift of the absorption edge), and led to an increase in the average visible transmittance (AVT).

SCLCP doping increases the grain size in the crystalline perovskite film by controlled solvent evaporation and reduced grain boundaries, which slow the material degradation and reduce the charge recombination.

The photo-response behavior and the resultant On/Off current ratio increased as the size of the embedded perovskite NPs decreased, due to the enhanced photo-induced charge transfer across the dielectric/pentacene interface, benefiting from the better confinement effect of perovskite NPs in the polymer matrix.

By optimizing the thickness of the C60 ETL, a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.72% is obtained with almost no hysteresis and less than 10% decay in efficiency is observed during a two-week stability test.

However, the presence of oxygen introduces instability as it scavenges away transferred electrons from the electron-transporting metal oxide, leaving behind holes to accumulate at CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, which in turn induce anodic corrosion. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements have enabled us to identify PbO as the major photodegraded product. The importance of the surrounding atmosphere and the supporting metal oxide in governing the stability of perovskite nanocrystals is discussed.",,,,,"Kamat, Prashant/0000-0002-2465-6819; Scheidt, Rebecca/0000-0001-7715-3396",,,,,,,,,,,,1948-7185,,,,,18-Oct,2018,9,20,,,,,5962,5969,,10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b02690,,,,,,,,WOS:000448751700009,30260227,,,,

The efficiency of the Cs3Bi2I9 solar cell can be slightly improved by changing the stoichiometry of the precursor solutions, which is most probably due to the reduction in nonradiative defects as evident from our single-crystal photoluminescence spectroscopy.

However, those dopants can introduce undesired charge traps that hinder charge transport through TiO2, so the improvement in the V-oc is often accompanied by an undesired photocurrent density-voltage (J-V) hysteresis problem. Herein, it is demonstrated that the use of a rapid flame doping process (40 s) to introduce cobalt dopant into TiO2 not only solves the J-V hysteresis problem but also increases the V-oc and power conversion efficiency of both mesoscopic and planar PSCs. The reasons for the simultaneous improvements are two fold. First, the flame-doped Co-TiO2 film forms Co-O-v (cobalt dopant-oxygen vacancy) pairs and hence reduces the number density of Ti3+ trap states. Second, Co doping upshifts the band structure of TiO2, facilitating efficient charge extraction. As a result, for planar PSCs, the flame doping of Co increases the efficiency from 17.1% to 18.0% while reducing the hysteresis from 16.0% to 1.7%. Similarly, for mesoscopic PSCs, the flame doping of Co increases the efficiency from 18.5% to 20.0% while reducing the hysteresis from 7.0% to 0.1%.",,,,"Park, Jong Hyeok/A-7778-2012; Norskov, Jens/D-2539-2017","Park, Jong Hyeok/0000-0002-6629-3147; Norskov, Jens/0000-0002-4427-7728",,,,,,,,,,,,1614-6832,1614-6840,,,,15-Oct,2018,8,29,,,,,,,1801717,10.1002/aenm.201801717,,,,,,,,WOS:000447257000009,,,,,

These stresses provide a significant driving force for fracture. Films are shown to be more unstable under tensile stress-and conversely more stable under compressive stress-when exposed to heat or humidity. Increasing the formation temperature of perovskite films directly correlates with larger residual stresses, a result of the high thermal expansion coefficient of perovskites. Specifically, this tensile stress forms upon cooling to room temperature, as the substrate constrains the perovskite from shrinking. No evidence of stress relaxation is observed, with the purely elastic film stress attributed to the thermal expansion mismatch between the perovskite and substrate. Additionally, the authors demonstrate that using a bath conversion method to form the perovskite film at room temperature leads to low stress values that are unaffected by further annealing, indicating complete perovskite formation prior to annealing.

With the use of a liquid electrolyte, the photovoltaic conversion efficiency of PbS-MAPI/TNTAs reached 5.98%, which was approximately 4.12 and 2.96 times of that of PbS/TNTAs and MAPI/TNTAs, respectively. This study provided a strategy to fabricate low-cost, high-efficiency Solar Cells with the use of PbS-MAPI heterostructures. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Comprehensive optical modeling is essential to minimize the optical losses of state-of-the-art perovskite/perovskite, perovskite/CIGS, and perovskite/silicon tandems. Such models require accurate optical constants of wide-bandgap perovskites. Here, we report optical constants determined with ellipsometry and spectrophotometry for two new wide-bandgap, cesium-formamidinium-based perovskites. We validate the optical constants by comparing simulated quantum efficiency and reflectance spectra with measured cell results for semi-transparent single-junction perovskite cells and find less than 0.3 mA/cm(2) error in the short-circuit current densities. Such simulations further reveal that reflection and parasitic absorption in the front ITO layer and electron contact are responsible for the biggest optical losses. We also show that the complex refractive index of methylammonium lead triiodide, the most common perovskite absorber for solar cells, can be used to generate approximate optical constants for an arbitrary wide-bandgap perovskite by translating the data along the wavelength axis. Finally, these optical constants are used to map the short-circuit current density of a textured two-terminal perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell as a function of the perovskite thickness and bandgap, providing a guide to nearly 20 mA/cm(2) matched current density with any perovskite bandgap between 1.56 and 1.68 eV.

According to the difference on the crystalline structure, the HOIPs could be classified into layered and non-layered perovskites. Very recently, it has been realized that the non-layered HOIPs with common-vertex structure possess even better opto-electrical performance. Yet the carrier recombination mechanism in perovskite remains not very clear, and a clear understanding of this mechanism is essential to pinpoint the working mechanism of photovoltaic and electroluminescent materials. Here we report the optical studies on the hybrid perovskite crystalline nano-sheet of CH3NH3PbBr3 with common-vertex structure. It is shown that the non-layered perovskite crystalline nanosheets possess the exciton binding energy about two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the layered perovskite and the colloidal nanoplates, which is beneficial for the designing of the high-efficiency photovoltaic devices. By measuring the temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectra, the excitation-power-variant PL spectra, and the time-resolved PL spectra, we identify that both the free-carrier and the localized exciton recombination channels may coexist in the crystallites. Further, for the thin crystallite (similar to 60 nm), the free-carrier recombination channel dominates; whereas when the thickness increases beyond 200 nm, the localized exciton recombination channel plays the major role. We suggest these results are helpful to improve further the photovoltaic and electroluminescent performances of perovskite devices.

Due to the complex electronic structure of the hybridized valence band in NiO, the chemical nature of the hole acceptor state has remained an open question, despite the fact that hole localization in this material significantly influences device efficiency. To comment on this, we present results of ultrafast charge carrier dynamics in a NiO based model heterojunction (Fe2O3/NiO) using extreme ultraviolet reflectionabsorption (XUV-RA) spectroscopy. Element specific XUV-RA spectroscopy demonstrates the formation of transient Ni3+ within 10 ps following selective photoexcitation of the underlying Fe2O3 substrate. This indicates that hole transfer in this system occurs to NiO valence band states composed of significant Ni 3d character. Additionally, we show that this hole injection process proceeds via a two-step sequential mechanism where fast, field-driven exciton dissociation occurs in Fe2O3 in 680 +/- 60 fs, followed by subsequent hole injection to NiO in 9.2 +/- 2.9 ps.

For example, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on these materials could see application in flatpanel displays and solid-state lighting, owing to their potential to be made at low cost via facile solution processing, and could provide tunable colours and narrow emission line widths at high photoluminescence quantum yields(4-8). However, the highest reported external quantum efficiencies of green-and red-light-emitting perovskite LEDs are around 14 per cent(7,9) and 12 per cent(8), respectively-still well behind the performance of organic LEDs(10-12) and inorganic quantum dot LEDs(13). Here we describe visible-light-emitting perovskite LEDs that surpass the quantum efficiency milestone of 20 per cent. This achievement stems from a new strategy for managing the compositional distribution in the device-an approach that simultaneously provides high luminescence and balanced charge injection. Specifically, we mixed a presynthesized CsPbBr3 perovskite with a MABr additive (where MA is CH3NH3), the differing solubilities of which yield sequential crystallization into a CsPbBr3/MABr quasi-core/shell structure. The MABr shell passivates the nonradiative defects that would otherwise be present in CsPbBr3 crystals, boosting the photoluminescence quantum efficiency, while the MABr capping layer enables balanced charge injection.

Additionally, an inorganic wide band gap Ga2O3 is introduced as a tunneling nanolayer into interface between the metal electrode and electron transport layer that effectively passivate interface and mitigate moisture and metal ion diffusion. These treatments enable the fabrication of CH3NH3PbI3-based inverted PSCs with excellent power conversion efficiencies up to 19.86% as well as enhanced ambient stability.

Therefore, we investigate the effect of substituting Rb for Cs in CsPbI3 on the chemical stability against decomposition using first-principles thermodynamics. The calculated Helmholtz free energy of solid solutions indicates that Cs1-xRbxPbI3 has good thermodynamic stability at room temperature due to the good miscibility of CsPbI3 and RbPbI3. By calculating the Helmholtz free energy difference of solid solutions Cs1-xRbxPbI3 from their constituents Cs1-xRbxI and PbI2, we find that the Rb content x approximate to 0.7 and 0.4 at zero and room temperature are the turning points, at which the chemical decomposition changes from endothermic to exothermic. From the calculated Gibbs free energy differences, we further highlight that RbPbI3 may decompose spontaneously at any temperature and pressure, while CsPbI3 in the cubic phase can be safe against decomposition in the temperature range of 0-600 K and the pressure range of 0-4 GPa.

However, they are less explored as electron transporting materials for perovskite solar cells, despite their compatible energy levels and good electron mobilities. In this work, three n-type non-fullerene acceptors are applied as electron transporting materials in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). All three compounds are of a rigid ladder-type structure with different conjugation lengths of the central multi-fused ring and end-capped with 2-(6-oxo-5,6-dihydro-4H-cyclopenta[c]thiophen-4-ylidene)malononitrile (CPTCN). Consequently, IDTCN, IDT6CN and ITCPTC with five, six and seven fused-rings are obtained. The longest conjugation length in ITCPTC leads to the enhanced electron mobility, and electron extraction and electron transporting ability. In addition, the ITCPTC molecule shows a predominant face-on orientation in neat films, which is favorable for charge transport in PSCs. As a result, inverted PSCs using the ITCPTC ETL deliver a champion efficiency of 17.42%, while the devices with IDT6CN and IDTCN exhibit a lower efficiency of 15.56% and 13.86%. Moreover, the non-fullerene acceptors also perform well when applied as interfacial materials in PSCs; ITCPTC delivers a remarkable efficiency of 19.51%, with a FF value as high as 82%.

The incorporation of the FASCN additive greatly prevents quasi-2D tin-based perovskites from oxidation during film formation, through strong chemical interactions with the tin component (Sn2+).

A compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) layer is used as an ETL, which is compared with a PCBM ETL and a c-TiO2/PCBM bilayered ETL. The MAPbI(3) layer thickness is varied from 100 nm to 800 nm by controlling the precursor solution concentration. The hysteresis increases with perovskite layer thickness for the c-TiO2 layer, while the hysteresis decreases with increasing the perovskite layer thickness in the presence of PCBM. Deep trap states are much more reduced upon inserting PCBM compared with those of the c-TiO2 case, indicative of fewer traps for non-radiative recombination. The ideality factor obtained from the light-dependent open-circuit voltage (V-oc) increases for the c-TiO2 layer but decreases for both the c-TiO2/PCBM bilayer and the PCBM layer as the perovskite layer thickness increases, which again supports that the dependence of hysteresis on the perovskite thickness is related to trap states, that is, decreases in deep trap states can reduce hysteresis. From the capacitance-frequency studies, it is found that the low-frequency capacitance correlates with the observed hysteresis, where it increases for the c-TiO2 layer but decreases for the PCBM containing ETLs with perovskite thickness.

Quantum-chemical calculations reveal that the designed molecules behave much better than TDTP in terms of electron mobility, air stability, and solubility, where the electron mobility of TDTP-3b is two orders of magnitude higher than that of TDTP owing to the extra S center dot center dot center dot N interactions in TDTP-3b that lead to the quasi two-dimensional p packing motif which facilitates electron transport evidently.

EG treated PEDOT:PSS:WOx thin films exhibited transmittance as high as 95% in the visible range and sheet resistance as low as 35 Omega sq(-1). And, PEDOT:PSS films exhibited sheet resistance of 25 Omega sq(-1) at 90% transmittance, which is the lowest value reported to date to the best of our knowledge. Additionally, thin films treated with EG multiple times exhibit improved thermal stability; thin films annealed at 250 degrees C have shown a remarkable stable conductivity. Furthermore, these layers are investigated as HTLs for high efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Neat PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS:WOx, and EG treated PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS:WOx integrated in PSCs demonstrated a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.17%, 10.42%, 12.31% and 12.69%, respectively.

The formation energies of X-site vacancies are calculated for these double perovskites, and predicted to be related to the electronic configurations of B-site cations. Cs2AgInCl6 is found to have the lowest vacancy formation energy among these double perovskites due to the unfilled s-orbitals of In3+. Using the climbing-image nudged elastic band method, these double perovskites are found with different barriers for halide ion migrations around Ag- and B-III-octahedrons due to different migration bottleneck radii and B-X bond characters. In our calculations Cs2AgBiBr6 shows the lowest energy barrier for X-site ion migration, which can explain the phenomenon of the huge hysteresis in Cs2AgBiBr6 solar cells reported.

Using this strategy, not only can the required thermal treatment time and temperature of the sol-gel reaction be significantly reduced but also the quality of the film can be improved. The enhanced reaction rate can be ascribed to the presence of hydroxyl anions, which facilitate the formation of the metal hydroxide and the subsequent metal oxide.

If we decrease the humidity by sending dry air (keeping nitrogen to oxygen ratio same), then this effect is absent. This phenomenon is related to the presence of oxygen in the environment. When humidity is decreased by flowing dry nitrogen, the oxygen present in the environment of perovskite solar cell also reduces.

We conclude that the light-soaking instability of these perovskite solar cells is mainly originated from the charge accumulation at the TiO2/perovskite interface and can be eliminated once the interfacial charge can be suppressed by interfacial modifications to improve charge transport at the interface.",,,,"Wang, Tao/G-6241-2011","Wang, Tao/0000-0002-5887-534X",,,,,,,,,,,,1944-8244,1944-8252,,,,3-Oct,2018,10,39,,,,,33144,33152,,10.1021/acsami.8b08958,,,,,,,,WOS:000446919800023,30192502,,,,

The current-voltage hysteresis often observed in hybrid perovskite solar cells has been assigned to the presence of mobile ions inside the perovskite layer. The difficulty in studying electronic properties of solar cells results from the screening effects as well as slow dynamics of mobile ions, particularly if they are located at the interfaces. In this work, we addressed the distribution of charged species in planar-type methylammonium lead iodine (MAPI) as well as formamidinium lead iodine (FAPI) solar cells by using a modified capacitance-voltage (CV) method without illumination in combination with a Mott-Schottky (MS) analysis of experimental data. The characteristic Mott-Schottky behavior with a linear dependence of C-2(V), distinctive for a pn-junction, is not visible in pristine devices. Surprisingly, biasing the device in the forward direction results in MS behavior, which is due to the field-driven redistribution of mobile ions from the interface toward the absorber bulk. From the MS analysis, we deduced space charge concentrations of 2.5 x 10(16) and 2.8 X 10(16) cm(-3) for the FAPI and the MAPI devices, respectively. However, the junction formation effect is not sustainable, since mobile ions relax to their initial location at ambient conditions. However, if the prebiasing is done at temperatures slightly below room temperature, the pn-junction can be stabilized for the FAPI device. In contrast, the MAPI device shows a rapid redistribution of mobile ions back to the transport layers during the measurement even at lower temperatures. This can be observed in the quite different doping profiles for the two perovskite devices.",,,,"Dyakonov, Vladimir/F-6862-2013; Tvingstedt, Kristofer/Q-9319-2017","Dyakonov, Vladimir/0000-0001-8725-9573; Tvingstedt, Kristofer/0000-0003-0516-9326",,,,,,,,,,,,2574-0962,,,,,OCT,2018,1,10,,,,,5129,5134,,10.1021/acsaem.8b01119,,,,,,,,WOS:000458706600003,,,,,

The substitution of cations or anions in the perovskite crystal lattice by different elements, followed by the rule of Goldschmidt tolerance factor, can also produce stable inorganic perovskites with enhanced electronic and optical properties.

In perovskite solar cells (PSCs), various types of dopants have been developed for organic hole transport materials (HTMs); however, the knowledge of the basic requirements for being efficient dopants as well as the comprehensive roles of the dopants in PSCs has not been clearly revealed. Here, three copper-based complexes with controlled redox activities are applied as dopants in PSCs, and it is found that the oxidative reactivity of dopants presents substantial impacts on conductivity, charge dynamics, and solar cell performance. A significant improvement of open- circuit voltage (V-oc) by more than 100 mV and an increase of power conversion efficiency from 13.2 to 19.3% have been achieved by tuning the doping level of the HTM. The observed large variation of V-oc for three dopants reveals their different recombination kinetics at the perovskite/HTM interfaces and suggests a model of an interfacial recombination mechanism. We also suggest that the dopants in HTMs can also affect the charge recombination kinetics as well as the solar cell performance. Based on these findings, a strategy is proposed to physically passivate the electron- hole recombination by inserting an ultrathin Al2O3 insulating layer between the perovskite and the HTM.

We find that complexation l with Lewis bases, relative humidity, and temperature are important factors during solvent vapor annealing (SVA) of films. During SVA, water vapor and higher temperatures limit the formation of the BiI3-dimethylformamide coordination complex. SVA with an optimized water content and temperature produces films with 300-500 nm grains. Films that formed solvent coordination compounds at lower temperatures showed preferential crystal orientation after solvent removal, and we elucidate its implications for carrier transport. Addition of diinethyl sulfoxide to highly concentrated tetrahydrofuran-BiI3 inks prevents film cracking after spin-coating. We have measured a quasi-Fermi level splitting of 1.1 eV and al diffusion length of 70 nm from films processed with optimal temperature and humidity. The best device produced by optirnized SVA has a power conversion efficiency of 0.5%, I-sc of similar to 4 mA/cm(2), and V-OC of similar to 400 mV. The low photocurrent and voltage we attribute to the low diffusion length and the unfavorable band alignment between the absorber and the adjacent transport layers.

The lifetimes depend on defect positions and densities and on the kinetic prefactors that control the phonon-assisted interaction between the extended states in the conduction and valence band and the localized defect states.

The incorporation of Zn-TFSI2 as a dopant for spiro-MeOTAD leads to an increase by one order in the hole mobility compared to Li-TFSI from 3.78 x 10(-3) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) to 3.83 x 10(-2) cm(2) V-1 s(-1). Furthermore, the device with Zn-TFSI2 showed an 80 mV higher built-in voltage and a bigger recombination resistance than the one with Li-TFSI, which were responsible for the striking increase in both the open-circuit voltage and fill factor, leading to a stabilized PCE of 22.0% for the best cells. Remarkably, the device employing Zn-TFSI2 demonstrated superb photo-stability, showing even a 2% increase in the PCE after 600 h light soaking at the maximum power point (mpp) under full sun, while the PCE of the device with Li-TFSI decreased by 20% under the same conditions. Similarly, the device with Zn-TFSI2 showed better operational stability at 50 degrees C resulting in a 21% decrease in the PCE after 100 h aging at the mpp under full sun while the Li-TFSI based one showed a 55% decrease. Moreover, the Zn-TFSI2 based device was capable of effectively resisting humidity compared to the one based on Li-TFSI from shelf stability monitoring (R.H. 40%) in the dark.",,,,,"Stojanovic, Marko/0000-0001-7933-8386",,,,,,,,,,,,1754-5692,1754-5706,,,,1-Oct,2018,11,10,,,,,2985,2992,,10.1039/c8ee01500g,,,,,,,,WOS:000448339100022,,,,,

Subsequently, a systematic photo-carrier dynamics study revealed that the performance enhancement was a direct consequence of (a) the promoted fill factor and open circuit voltage due to the improved electron diffusion coefficient and the longer charge recombination time, (b) the increased charge collection efficiency owing to the cascade charge transfer from TiO2 to GNRs to FTO electrode, resulting in a higher external quantum efficiency and thus a larger short circuit current density and (c) the suppressed current-voltage hysteresis ascribed to the increased charge transfer noted above.

The field-effect mobilities of perovskite photodetector treated by one-step (OS) direct annealing method at room temperature shows mobility as 0.256 (0.129) cm(2)V( -l)s(-1) for holes (electrons), which increase to 2.32 (1.18) cm(2)V (-1)s( -1) for that treated by muti-step (MS) annealing method.

Despite its solution processed polycrystalline thin film form in solar cells, the single crystalline counterpart may offer some incredibly novel optoelectronic functionalities. In this work, a sizable (> 5 mm ) and high quality CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal has been synthesized by the inverse temperature crystallization method, and a white-light photodetector of the structure glass/ITO/Ga/CH3NH3PbI3/Au was fabricated. Overbroad photo-excitation intensities ranging from 0.1 mW/cm(2) to 100 mW/cm(2) using a sun-light simulator, the on-off ratio is tunable in a wide-range from 65 to 2250 at zero bias voltage. The responsivity (R) and detectivity (D*) are 36.2 mA/W and 2.68 x10(11) Jones respectively at a weak white-light intensity such as 0.1 mW/cm(2). Both the photodetective parameters decrease with the increase of the illumination intensity. Based on impedance spectra obtained at working condition and light intensity dependent J(SC) measurements, the surface trap-assist recombination may play a dominating role. The corresponding lifetime (tau(surf)) and resistance (R-surf_trap ) exhibit fast decays at higher illumination intensities. This fundamental study may pave the way for exploring the contribution of the surface trap-assist recombination in the CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal based photodetector.

The obtained In-doped ZnO morphologies were used as an electron transporting materials (ETMs) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), and the photovoltaic results showed that the short-circuit-current-density (J(sc)) and the average power conversion efficiency (PCEavg) of the nanochips based PSCs were 21.9 mA cm(-2) and 15.17%, respectively, which were largely enhanced compared with those of the nanodisks based PSCs (18.2 mA cm(-2) and 11.18%). The substantial enhancement for the former was thanks to the sufficient perovskite absorber loading, better morphology and crystallinity.

Proper measurement protocols (MPs) should be employed for the experimental data reproducibility, in particular for a reliable evaluation of the power conversion efficiency (PCE), as well as for a meaningful characterization of the type and magnitude of the hysteresis. We discuss here several MPs by comparing the experimental J-V characteristics with simulated ones using the dynamic electrical model (DEM). Pre-poling conditions and bias scan rate can have a dramatic influence not only on the apparent solar cell performance, but also on the hysteretic phenomena. Under certain measurement conditions, a hysteresis-free behavior with relatively high PCEs may be observed, although the J-V characteristics may be far away from the stationary case. Furthermore, forward-reverse and reverse-forward bias scans show qualitatively different behaviors regarding the type of the hysteresis, normal and inverted, depending on the bias pre-poling. We emphasize here that correlated double-scans, forward-reverse or reverse-forward, where the second scan is conducted in the opposite sweep direction and begins immediately after the first scan is complete, are essential for a correct assessment of the dynamic hysteresis. In this context, we define a hysteresis index which consistently assigns the hysteresis type and magnitude. Our DEM simulations, supported by experimental data, provide further guidance for an efficient and accurate determination of the stationary J-V characteristics, showing that the type and magnitude of the dynamic hysteresis may be affected by unintentional pre-conditioning in typical experiments.",,,,"Pintilie, Ioana/C-4545-2011; Manolescu, Andrei/G-4565-2014; Pintilie, Lucian/D-9475-2011","Manolescu, Andrei/0000-0002-0713-4664; Pintilie, Lucian/0000-0002-4934-2912; Tomulescu, Andrei Gabriel/0000-0002-3025-6854",,,,,,,,,,,,0038-092X,,,,,OCT,2018,173,,,,,,976,983,,10.1016/j.solener.2018.08.033,,,,,,,,WOS:000452940800093,,,,,

Our studies show that the bandgap of MAPI is dimension dependent and is maximum for 1D.

Our studies show that the 2D MAPI is better for a solar cell due to lower effective mass of electron and hole arising from the strong s-p anti-bonding coupling.

The current-voltage (I-V) measurements are carried out in dark and under illumination conditions to investigate the charge transport process and photodetector performance. The important diode electrical parameters (ideality factor, saturation current, and barrier height) are extracted by the analysis of I-V characteristics using Shockley model. The observed rectification and photo response behavior is analyzed using energy level diagram. The photodetector demonstrates good photoresponse and exhibits responsivity and detectivity value of 0.4 A/W and detectivity of 3 x 10(11) Jones, respectively at -5 V. The charge transport mechanisms are examined under the framework of space charge limited conduction (SCLC) model, which helps to extract the mobility, trap density and trap energy.

Light transmission and photoluminescence (PL) microscopy and spectroscopy were used to monitor the growth of crystals and transformation of their properties in time under nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature.

To achieve higher device performance and reliability needed for widespread commercial deployment, spatial heterogeneity of optoelectronic properties in the perovskite thin film needs to be understood and controlled. Clear identification of the causes underlying this heterogeneity, most importantly the spatial heterogeneity in charge trapping behavior, has remained elusive. Here, a multimodal imaging approach consisting of photoluminescence, optical transmission, and atomic force microscopy is utilized to separate electronic heterogeneity from morphology variations in perovskite thin films. By comparing the degree of heterogeneity in highly oriented and randomly oriented polycrystalline perovskite thin film samples, we reveal that disorders in the crystallographic orientation of the grains play a dominant role in determining charge trapping and electronic heterogeneity. This work also demonstrates a polycrystalline thin film with uniform charge trapping behavior by minimizing crystallographic orientation disorder.

However, TiO2 generally shows a relatively low electron mobility, which may result in charge accumulation and recombination at the TiO2/perovskite interface, thus hindering the improvements from the PMPSCs performance. In this study, a simple strategy to deposit a pristine C-60 layer using a spray method is reported and the low electrical conductivity of TiO2 in PMPSCs is modified. The preferable electron extraction and transportation properties of pristine C-60 and the up-shifted lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the C-60 modified TiO2, that is, TiO2(C-60) layer, efficiently promotes the charge transfer at the interface between the electron transport layer (ETL) and the perovskite. As a result, a significantly improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.4% is yielded, which is much higher than that of the control device (13.7%). In addition, the TiO2(C-60)-based device presents a lower hysteresis effect than that of the TiO2-based device, which can likely be attributed to the reduced space charge accumulation at the perovskite/ETL interface.

Herein, Pb2+ solution post-processing strategy is introduced to passivate the deep trap states of CsPbI2Br films. The dissociative Pb2+ in the solution effectively combines with the excess halide ions on the perovskite surface to reduce the deep trap states of Pb vacancy (V-Pb) and I interstitial (I-i).

The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the hybrid solar cell comprising 5% perovskite NCs is 10% enhanced compared to the organic reference, mainly due to the enlarged light harvesting and increased short circuit current density (J(sc)). However, results suggest that introducing a higher amount of perovskite content induces bimolecular and trap-assisted recombination in the ternary devices. We perform a comprehensive transient absorption study of the charge transfer/transport mechanisms by employing femto-second pump-probe transient absorption spectroscopy (fs-TAS). fs-TAS measurements demonstrate a slower charge carrier recombination rate due to the introduction of perovskite NCs into the photoactive layer. Results reveal that DPP injects electrons from the singlet excited state into the perovskite NCs, which causes the desired cascading charge carrier transfer. In ternary blends, a small amount of FAPbI(3) NCs provides an additional pathway in favor of the charge-separated state via the NCs, which, despite accelerating the depopulation of DPP's singlet excited state slightly slows down the charge-separation process between DPP and PC61BM.

Our results show that the differences in the spectra are due to the variation in the phase composition. At room temperature, the tetragonal (TE) phase is dominant in the BCs, while the orthorhombic (OR) phase is dominant in the TFs. The PL spectra of the TFs also show discernible contributions from the TE and the cubic phases. At lower temperatures, the increase in excitonic recombination causes a red shift of the PL spectra from the TFs, while a phase transition from the TE to the OR phase results in a blue shift of the PL from the BCs. The temperature-dependent narrowing of the PL linewidths shows a stronger coupling between the longitudinal optical phonons and the free carriers in the OR phase as compared to the TE phase, implying a reduced carrier mobility.

However, g-QDs have a thick-shell which serves as a physical barrier for electron and hole transfer, leading to a slow charge transfer rate. In this work, we synthesized CdSe/CdSexS1-x/CdS core/shell/shell g-QDs with an intermediate CdSexS1-x alloyed layer. The presence of this interfacial layer largely improves the absorption of CdSe/CdS QDs, particularly in the 300-650 nm range.

For semiconductors, development of contact formation is inseparable from device performance and stability. Single-crystalline MAPbX(3) has become of great interest for perovskite devices in photodetectors, light-emitting diodes, and more recently in high-energy radiation detection. Deeper research is required to understand interfacial interactions in single-crystalline MAPbX(3). This article focuses on the dynamic impact of electrode metal (Au and Cr) on methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr(3)) single crystals. It is studied how charge transport properties of single crystal MAPbBr(3) can be tuned via electrode material selection at the metal/MAPbBr(3) interface to improve device performance with proper contact formation. The ability to create an ohmic-like or nonohmic contact by switching the electrode metal from Cr to Au, respectively, is demonstrated.

In ambient air, fabrication generally relies on solvent engineering to obtain compact films. In contrast, this work explores the potential of altering the perovskites microstructure for solar cell engineering. This work starts with CH3NH3PbI3-xClx, films with grain morphology carefully controlled by varying the deposition speed during the spin-coating process to fabricate efficient and partially transparent solar cells. Devices produced with a CH3NH3PbI3-xClx film and a compact thick top gold electrode reach a maximum efficiency of 10.2% but display a large photocurrent hysteresis. As it is demonstrated, the introduction of different concentrations of bromide in the precursor solution addresses the hysteresis issues and turns the film morphology into a partially transparent interconnected network of 1D microstructures. This approach leads to semitransparent solar cells with negligible hysteresis and efficiencies up to 7.2%, while allowing average transmission of 17% across the visible spectrum.

However, when reducing the surface defects of 3D perovskite, the thin 2D capping layer itself may probably introduce additional interfacial defects in a 2D/3D stacking structure, which is thought to be able to trigger trap-assisted nonradiative recombination or ion migration. Thus, efforts should be paid to reduce the interfacial defects of 2D hybrid perovskite when serving as a modification layer in a 2D/3D stacking structure PSCs. Here, we demonstrate that bromine (Br) doping of the 2D perovskite capping layer is an efficient strategy to passivate interfacial defects robustly, by which the photoluminescence lifetime is enhanced notably, whereas the interfacial charge recombination is suppressed a lot. As a result, the PCE is enhanced from 18.01% (3D perovskite) to 20.07% (Br-doped 2D/3D perovskite) along with improved moisture stability.",,,,"Liu, Junxue/L-8206-2013","Liu, Junxue/0000-0001-8349-1017",,,,,,,,,,,,1944-8244,,,,,19-Sep,2018,10,37,,,,,31755,31764,,10.1021/acsami.8b09461,,,,,,,,WOS:000445439900088,30136568,,,,

Here we explore these processes with dye-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 and TiO2/Ta2O5 core-shell photoanodes in aqueous electrolytes using TA spectroscopy, intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS), and photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS). The fast recombination rates measured by TA result from strong laser excitation that leads to high electron occupancy in TiO2, whereas IMVS modulates the concentration of charge-separated states near solar irradiance levels. The recombination processes measured by electrochemical methods such as IMVS, PEIS, and transient photovoltage are the discharging of injected electrons in TiO2, as evidenced by the close agreement between the nearly first-order recombination rates probed by IMVS and the RC time constants derived from PEIS data. However, IMVS measurements at variable probe light intensity reveal that the reaction orders for the recombination of injected electrons with oxidized sensitizer molecules are far from unity.

As direct bandgap semiconductors, lead halide perovskites also show wide-band tunable emissions with high quantum yield, which is important for numerous practical applications, especially for the ""green gap"" region of conventional semiconductors such as III-nitrides and III-phosphides. Consequently, versatile lead halide perovskite based micro- and nanolasers have been proposed and experimentally demonstrated in the past few years. This review discusses the recent advances of perovskite micro- and nanolasers. Following their fundamentals in light confinement and material properties, perovskite micro- and nanolasers have been categorized into six sections, i.e., pristine lasers, structured perovskite lasers, multiphoton pumped lasers, perovskite lasers with better stability, postsynthetic control of perovskite lasers, and perovskite laser arrays.

Various calculations find that a dynamical Rashba effect could significantly contribute to these long lifetimes. This effect is predicted to cause a spin splitting of the electronic bands of inversion-symmetric crystalline materials at finite temperatures, resulting in a slightly indirect band gap. Direct experimental evidence of the existence or the strength of the spin splitting is lacking. Here, we resonantly excite photocurrents in single crystalline (CH3NH3)PbI3 with circularly polarized light to clarify the existence of spin splittings in the band structure. We observe a circular photogalvanic effect, i.e., the photocurrent depends on the light helicity, in both orthorhombic and tetragonal (CH3NH3)PbI3. At room temperature, the effect peaks for excitation photon energies Delta E = 110 meV below the direct optical band gap. Temperature-dependent measurements reveal a sign change of the effect at the orthorhombic-tetragonal phase transition, indicating different microscopic origins in the two phases.

In the entire electrochemical cycle, the transparent counter electrode is regarded as reducing agent in reducing the oxidation state I-3(-) in the electrolyte to the reduced state I- so the electrocatalytic activity, chemical stability, electrical conductivity of the transparent counter electrode directly influences the rear side photo-to-electricity efficiency of device and the preparation of transparent counter electrodes is significantly important for the device. Therefore, it is necessary to study the effect of the counter electrode on the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the bifacial solar cells. In view of the problems of low transmittance, high cost, and low light utilization of traditional CE, the transparent CE of bifacial solar cells with high power conversion efficiency and low cost are preferred.

We observed this catalytic MIC (c-MIC) mechanism in a variety of sol-gel material systems including NixO with embedded Au or Ag; TiOx with embedded Ni, Au, or Pt; and SnOx with embedded Ni. Based upon this concept, we demonstrated highly efficient flexible and rigid organic/inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) using a low-temperature-sintered NixO film embedded with Au nanoislands as the hole-transporting layer (HTL). The c-MIC mechanism reduced the sintering temperature of the Au-embedded NixO HTL by 100 degrees C, making the NixO process compatible with plastic substrates while allowing the NixO HTL to retain more NiOOH surface groups, which enhanced hole collection and improved the quality of the perovskite layer. Thanks to the advantages of the c-MIC NixO film, the flexible and rigid PSCs achieved high power conversion efficiencies of up to 15.9 and 19.0%, respectively, which were sustained for >1200 h at 65 degrees C and 65% relative humidity. Our findings provide a practical route for low-temperature fabrication of high-quality oxide functional films by solution-based sol-gel processes, which will be valuable to a wide variety of applications in addition to thin film solar cells.",,,,"Shyue, Jing-Jong/D-7222-2011; Su, Wei-Fang/C-2646-2009",,,,,,,,,,,,,2050-7488,2050-7496,,,,14-Sep,2018,6,34,,,,,16450,16457,,10.1039/c8ta05973j,,,,,,,,WOS:000444698200019,,,,,

A 10-20 nm thick poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiphene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) layer is the most popular HTL in such a device structure. But is it essential to construct such a thick PEDOT:PSS layer? To address this question, herein self-assembled PEDOT:PSS monolayers are obtained on the indium tin oxide (ITO) surface through a facile water rinsing process. Perovskite solar cells with water rinsed PEDOT:PSS as a HTL yield improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 13.4% to 18.0%, compared with the control cells with as-cast PEDOT:PSS. The main contribution is from the open-circuit voltage (V-oc) and fill factor (FF). Characterization indicates that the majority of PEDOT:PSS is washed away, but an ultra-thin layer of PEDOT:PSS can attach strongly onto ITO via In-O-S chemical bonds between the PSS chain and ITO. Subsequently, PEDOT and PSS form a bilayered structure due to Coulomb interaction. Such an arrangement induces an oriented electric field from positively charged PEDOT to negatively charged PSS, which can accelerate the process of hole extraction. Moreover, the oriented arrangement of PEDOT:PSS monolayers provides higher work function and stronger hydrophobicity, leading to the enhancement in V-oc and stability in the ambient environment. This work suggests that there is still room for the efficiency improvement of perovskite solar cells by optimizing the traditional functional layers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2050-7488,2050-7496,,,,14-Sep,2018,6,34,,,,,16583,16589,,10.1039/c8ta05234d,,,,,,,,WOS:000444698200033,,,,,

However, as yet, no evaluation of their amenability and justification for the use of the results for the above-noted purposes has been reported. To check if we can learn from pulsed measurement results about steady-state phototransport properties, we show here that, although pulsed measurements can be useful to extract information on the recombination kinetics of HaPs, great care should be taken. One issue is that no changes in the material are induced during or as a result of the excitation, and another one concerns in how far pulsed excitation-derived data can be used to find relevant steady-state parameters. To answer the latter question, we revisited pulsed excitation and propose a novel way to compare between pulsed and steady state measurements at different excitation intensities. We performed steady-state photoconductivity and ambipolar diffusion length measurements, as well as pulsed time-resolved microwave conductivity and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements as a function of excitation intensity on the same samples of different MAPbI(3) thin films, and found good quasi-quantitative agreement between the results, explaining them with a generalized single level recombination model that describes the basic physics of phototransport of HaP absorbers. Moreover, we find the first experimental manifestation of the boundaries between several effective recombination regimes that exist in HaPs, by analyzing their phototransport behavior as a function of excitation intensity.

Here, the copper-nickel core-shell nanowire (Cu@Ni NW)-based composite electrode is proposed as a bottom window electrode for PSCs, without the involvement of a high cost precious metal and vacuum process.

When the Ni layer with the optimal thickness is introduced, the Cu@Ni NW electrode shows a high transmittance of 80.5% AVT at 400-800 nm, and a sheet resistance of 49.3 +/- 5 Omega sq(-1). Using the highly stable Cu@Ni NWs, the composite electrode structure is fabricated with sol-gel-derived Al-doped zinc oxide (AZO) over-layer for better charge collection and additional protection against iodine ions from the perovskite.

However, the inorganic perovskites of CsPbBr3 synthesized by the solution method often suffer from byproducts such as Cs4PbBr6 and CsPb2Br5. Herein, we have investigated thoroughly the solvent-related effect on the phase formation in CsBr-PbBr2 system through single crystal X-ray diffraction measurement. It is found that the prepared product is dominantly determined by the coordination number (CN) of Pb(II) and the ratio of precursors. By use of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or dimethylformamide (DMF) as the solvent, Pb2+ is found to be surrounded by six-coordination sites, and the products can be tuned from CsPbBr3 to Cs4PbBr6 by increasing the precursor ratio of CsBr to PbBr2. On the contrary, in the solvent of water, only Pb2+ eight-coordinated crystal of CsPb2Br5 can be produced, regardless of the ratio of CsBr to PbBr2. More importantly, with the investigation of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) for Pb L-II edge in precursor solutions, we identify that the CNs of Pb(II) of resultants are the same as those of the corresponding plumbite oligomers in precursor solutions.

In this study, pristine graphene nanofibers were introduced into the perovskite layer of PSCs for the first time. The quality of the electrospun graphene nanofibers was optimized by controlled centrifugation of graphene sheets in the precursor suspension. Under optimized conditions, the device power conversion efficiency increased from 17.51% without graphene to 19.83% with graphene nanofibers, representing a 13% increase. The introduction of graphene nanofibers into the perovskite layer led to a dramatic increase in the grain size of the perovskite layer to over 2 mu m, owing to improved nucleation and crystallization at the nanofiber interface, which led to much higher FF and J(sc) values. The significant increases in J(sc) and V-oc are attributed to the improved charge-transport properties of the graphene nanofibers with superb charge conductivity introduced into the perovskite layer. The latter was independently verified by the measured electron transport time. The stability of the device was also improved.

As the temperature lowers down, the fill factor (FF) decreases while the open circuit voltage (V-OC) increases in the case of reverse scans (scanning from positive voltages to negative ones). The decreased FF is ascribed to the increased resistance of charge transport materials (both TiO2 and Spiro-OMeTAD) as well as the increased interfacial charge transfer resistance, while the increased V-OC is due to retarded recombination which is revealed by the transient photovoltage decay measurement. Hysteresis appears in the current-voltage curves, but it shrinks with temperature decreasing and even vanishes as the temperature becomes lower than 270 K. Mott-Schottky capacitance analysis shows that ion migration exists in the device, especially for temperatures >270 K. The ""S shape"" current-voltage characteristic is observed at lowered temperatures, which is caused by retarded charge extraction across the interface between the active layer and charge-transport materials. Similar power conversion properties are observed when elevating the temperature from 240K to 310K; thus, the temperature-sensitive behavior is reversible. The observed behavior is compared with silicon solar cells. The study shows that lowering the temperature is harmful to the charge extraction processes of perovskite solar cells. Highly conductive charge-transport materials are needed for the devices to operate in a colder environment.

The method described herein includes the use of one step spin coating solution processing using a solvent mixture (DMF + DMSO) to avoid the solubility issues of CsPbBr2I perovskite in DMF. The substrate temperature during spin coating was found to be a critical parameter to generate the required crystalline morphology of the perovskite thin films.

Because the band gaps of the three materials are similar, and also because the A-site cation does not contribute to band edges, one would expect a minor influence of A-site cation on the excited-state lifetime of the perovskites. Experiments defy that expectation. By performing ab initio nonadiabatic (NA) molecular dynamics combined with time-domain density functional simulations, we demonstrate that the nonradiative electron hole recombination times are in the order FAPbBr(3) > MAPbBr(3) > CsPbBr3, which are determined by the NA electron phonon coupling because decoherence times are similar. The simulations show that the larger A-site cation and the smaller NA coupling because larger A-site cation suppresses the Pb-Br cages' motion. The electron hole recombination is slow, ranging from subnanosecond to nanoseconds, because the NA coupling is small, less than 3 meV, and because decoherence time is slow, less than 7 fs.

Furthermore, the BP layers can enhance the light absorption of the total heterostructures, especially the M2GeBr4-BP heterostructure.

Among them, blue-light-based devices are extremely limited because of the lack of a facile method to obtain high-purity CsPbCl3 NWs. Herein, we report a direct and facile method for the synthesis of CsPbCl3 NWs assisted by inorganic ions that served both as a morphology controlling agent for the anisotropic growth of nanomaterials and a surface passivation species modulating the surface of nanomaterials. This new approach allows us to obtain high-purity and size-uniform NWs as long as 500 nm in length and 20 nm in diameter with high reproducibility. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultrafast spectroscopic measurements confirmed that a reduced band gap caused by the surface species of NWs relative to nanocubes (NCs) was achieved at the photon energy of 160 eV because of the hybrid surface passivation contributed by adsorbed inorganic ions. The resulting NWs demonstrate significantly enhanced photoelectrochemical performances, 3.5-fold increase in the photocurrent generation, and notably improved stability compared to their NC counterparts.

A sandwiched PCBM layer is also used between the perovskite and TiO2 layers to improve the interfacial contact. By using these two methods, the fabricated perovskite solar cells show a low hysteresis effect and high current density, which result from the improved compactness at the grain boundaries of the perovskite surface and the interface between the TiO2/perovskite layers. The theoretical and experimental results indicate that PCBM can effectively suppress carrier recombination, regardless of the interfacial layer or dopant. We also found that the dark current reduced during the analysis of dark state current-voltage (I-V) characteristics. The slopes of the I-V curves for the fluorine-doped tin oxide/PCBM-doped perovskite/Au device reduce monotonically with the increase in the PCBM concentration from 0.01 to 0.1 wt %, which suggest the decreasing defects in the perovskite layer.

CH3NH3PbI3 is the most efficient light harvester among all the known halide perovskites (PSCs). It is regarded as unsuitable for long-term stable solar cells, thus it is necessary to develop other types of PSC materials to achieve stable PSCs (Wang et al., Nat. Energy 2016, 2, 16195). Because of this, various research efforts are on-going to discover novel lead-based or lead-free single/double PSCs, which can be stable, synthesizable, transportable, abundant and efficient in solar energy conversion. Keeping these factors in mind, we report here the electronic structures, energetic stabilities and some materials properties (viz. band structures, density of states spectra and photo-carrier masses) of the PSC chloroammonium lead triiodide (ClNH3PbI3). This emerges through compositional engineering that often focuses on B- and Y-site substitutions within the domain of the BMY3 PSC stoichiometry. ClNH3PbI3 is found to be stable as orthorhombic and pseudocubic polymorphs, which are analogous with the low and high temperature polymorphs of CH3NH3PbI3. The bandgap of ClNH3PbI3 (values between 1.28 and 1.60 eV) is found to be comparable with that of CH3NH3PbI3, (1.58 eV), both obtained with periodic DFT at the PBE level of theory. Spin orbit coupling is shown to have a pronounced effect on both the magnitude and character of the bandgap. The computed results show that ClNH3PbI3 may act as a competitor for CH3NH3PbI3 for photovoltaics.

Using time-domain density functional theory combined with nonadiabatic (NA) molecular dynamics, we demonstrate that partial replacement of MA with formamidinium (FA) or guanidinium (GA) significantly reduces the NA electron vibrational coupling. The effect arises due to stiffening of the inorganic Pb I lattice, which exhibits strongly decreased fluctuations while maintaining its original structure and electronic band gap. In addition to extending charge carrier lifetimes, reduced lattice motions, and particularly those of iodides, are indicative of decreased ion diffusion that is responsible for formation of defects, such as iodine interstitials and vacancies, and current voltage hysteresis.

In this work, we introduce a thin MoO3 layer, in HTM-free PSCs, at the perovskite/gold interface in order to investigate its influence on photovoltaic (PV) performance and to study the charge extraction behavior, recombination lifetime, and effect of hysteresis. Charge extraction measurements show that implementing a MoO3 layer results in more charges to be extracted; this is beneficial to its PV performance. Intensity-modulated photo-voltage spectroscopy shows two characteristic times at high and low frequency. The high frequency is dependent on light intensity and is related to the charge carrier recombination in the perovskite, whereas the low frequency is independent of light intensity and might be related to ion diffusion. Finally, it was observed that the MoO3 forms a noncontinuous layer on the perovskite surface, which on the one hand improves its PV performance but on the other hand does not provide a physical barrier at this interface.

The main advantage in this work's LED is that the active layer is based on a blend of low dimensional (LD) perovskites entrapped in a polystyrene film, never reported before. The HOIS blend is formed by the admixture of two-dimensional (2D) (C6H5CH2CH2NH3)(2)PbBr4, one dimensional (1D) CH3NH3CdBr3, while the blend's entrapment is afforded by mixing it with dissolved polystyrene powder. It is found that final composite contains a blend of quasi two-dimensional (quasi-2D) perovskites, that exhibits green luminescence and electroluminescence, assisted by energy funneling phenomena toward the blend's moiety with the smallest energy band gap. The addition of Cd++ is reported as a paradigm for several effects; its addition is not inhibiting the electroluminescence, while also polystyrene successfully prevents even cadmium halide's degradation by moisture. Moreover, successful doping of the LED active material portrays possibilities for enhancing perovskite-based devices, as it has been shown that cation dopants enhance the photoluminescence or transfer energy toward the dopant's light emission energy bands.

However, it is still a great challenge to directly synthesize the TiO2 nanotube arrays with well-controlled geometries (e.g., diameter and height, etc.) on the surface of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO). Here, vertically standing TiO2 nanotube arrays with desirable heights and diameters are directly synthesized on the FTO surface by employing the aqueous TiO2 sol-gel method on tubular photoresist templates. The tube height can be precisely tailored within a range of 350-900 nm for the effective loading of perovskite precursor solution. Importantly, it is demonstrated that TiO2 nanotube arrays with the optimized tube diameter and length can facilitate the infiltration of perovskite precursor solution, and thus ensuring the formation of a dense, smooth and large grain-sized perovskite film. Moreover, the contact between the perovskite and TiO2 nanotube arrays are enhanced simultaneously. Benefiting from the high-quality perovskite film, good interfacial contact at the perovskite/TiO2 tube interface, enhanced light trapping as well as rapid electron collection and transport induced by one-dimensional TiO2 nanotubes, the fabricated PVSCs exhibit an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 14.13%.
