Herein, we elucidated the breakdown process of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite crystals and identified the polarity-dependent degradation pathway via localized charges by performing time-evolution measurements of the absorption spectra of perovskite films with different underlying charge transport layers and ab initio molecular dynamics calculations. It was found that the carrier polarity (hole-rich or electron-rich) inside the perovskite films played a critical role in the degradation rate, and the polarity-dependent degradation pathway strongly depended on the combination of the surrounding gaseous molecules. The hole-rich perovskite films degraded more rapidly than the electron-rich ones in the presence of H2O, while this degradation trend was reversed in oxygen-only ambient environments. Interestingly, the hole-rich film is extremely unstable in atmospheric air containing both H2O and O-2, whereas the MAPbI(3) film with excessive electrons was stable in air. An ab initio molecular dynamics simulation was performed to obtain the detailed degradation pathway of MAPbI(3) under atmospheric conditions for different polarities of the localized charge.

This is mostly due to the unexpected electron recombination happening at the interface of perovskite/carbon. Moreover, the low conductivity of the carbon electrode slows down the charge collection process and results in a low fill factor and poor PCE. To address these concerns, we firstly inserted an inorganic CuSCN HTM between the perovskite and the carbon electrode to suppress the electron recombination process. Then we used a highly conductive carbon nanotube (CNT) network to form a robust interface of CuSCN/CNT and facilitate the hole collection process. As a result, the updated CuSCN and CNT incorporated C-PSCs exhibit a V-OC of 1.01 V and deliver a PCE up to 17.58% (measured in the backward scan) with pretty good reproducibility, which is the highest PCE in C-PSCs.

We show that humidity does not always have detrimental effects. Indeed, the exposure of CsPbBr3 films to humidity for a limited time (2-3 days and 8 minutes for 60% and 80% RH, respectively) enhances their crystallinity. However, prolonged exposure to humidity results in partial degradation of the perovskite phase leading to the concomitant formation of a new, possibly hydrate, crystalline phase.

Solar cells with different trap densities are prepared using varying molar ratios of methylammonium iodide (MAI) and lead iodide (PbI2) precursors. Excess MAI in the precursor solution yields more traps/defects in perovskite films and when the trap density increases, trap-filling is the dominant loss mechanism, which results in a low FF in perovskite solar cells with excess MAI; this is especially the case at low light intensities. The FF of perovskite solar cells with excess MAI also shows a non-monotonic dependence on light intensity: the FF first increases, followed by a decrease with increasing light intensity. This non-monotonic dependence of the FF on light intensity suggests that both trap-filling and bimolecular recombination are involved in the determination of the FF in perovskite solar cells in cases where a high density of traps exists. Furthermore, we also observed that a stoichiometric precursor solution could lead to a monotonic light intensity-dependence for the FF in perovskite solar cells: the FF continuously decreases as the light intensity is increased from 1.7 to 100 mW cm(-2). This monotonic dependence of the FF on light intensity implies that bimolecular recombination is the main reason for the loss in FF in perovskite solar cells when a low density of trap states exists. In addition, the peak light intensity (P-peak), at which the FF shows the highest value, would shift to a smaller value when the amount of excess MAI in the precursor solution is decreased and it approaches the stoichiometric ratio of one. These results suggest that by looking at how the FF varies with light intensity we can deduce the contribution of traps in the performance of perovskite solar cells. This will help tremendously in focusing on areas for improvement for such solar cells.",,,,"Lam, Yeng Ming/A-2230-2011","Lam, Yeng Ming/0000-0001-9390-8074",,,,,,,,,,,,2050-7526,2050-7534,,,,21-May,2019,7,19,,,,,5646,5651,,10.1039/c9tc00816k,,,,,,,,WOS:000472444000009,,,,,

Efficient multiexciton generation in quantum dots may be a revolutionary discovery, because it provides a new method to improve the solar-to-electric power conversion efficiency in quantum dots-based solar cells and to design novel quantum dots-based multielectron or hole photocatalysts. However, the mechanism of ultrafast multiexciton generation and recombination remain unclear. In this paper, alloy-structured quantum dots, CdSeS, are prepared by the hot injection method. The generation and recombination mechanism of charge carriers in quantum dots samples are discussed in detail. The bivalent band structure of alloy-structured quantum dots is determined by ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra. It is found that the 1S(3/2) (h)-1S(e) (or 1S), 2S(3/2)(h)-1S(e) (or 2S) and 1P(3/2)(h)-1P(e) (or 1P) exciton absorption bands of these quantum dots are at 510 nm, 468 nm and 430 nm, respectively. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and nanosecond time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy are used to investigate the ultrafast exciton generation and recombination dynamics in the alloy-structured quantum dots. By fitting the transient kinetics of 1S exciton bleach, an average biexciton decay time is obtained to be about 80 ps, which is almost twice the decay time of traditional quantum dots (less than 50 ps). Combined with the recently developed ultrafast interface charge separation technology that can extract multiple excitons before their annihilation, it will have a promising application prospect. Moreover, there is a hole relaxation on a the time scale of 5-6 ps via a phonon coupling pathway to lower-energy hole states in addition to the above-described ultrafast exciton-exciton annihilation process in 2S and 1P excitons. Furthermore, by nanosecond time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, it can be concluded that the charge separated state is long-lived (200 ns). Our findings provide a valuable insight into the understanding of ultrafast multiexciton generation and recombination in quantum dots.

The hysteresis related stability issues are also investigated at different conditions, such as steady-state power output, aging, repeated voltage sweeping, varied pre-scan voltage bias, etc. It is found the hysteresis becomes much severer at different test conditions for the devices doped with small sized Li and Na.

One approach is to utilize the existing capability to manufacture thin film CdTe PVs at very low cost and add another inexpensive thin film absorber to create a tandem solar cell to improve device efficiency. For this, a semiconductor with an optimal bandgap must be identified, along with a suitable device architecture.

However, a fundamental limitation of MHPs is their low exciton binding energy, which results in a low radiative recombination rate and the dependence of PLQY on the excitation intensity. Under the operating conditions of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), the injected current densities are typically lower than the trap density, leading to a low actual PLQY. Moreover, the defects not only initiate the decomposition of MHPs caused by extrinsic factors, but also intrinsically stimulate ion migration across the interface and lead to the corrosion of electrodes due to interaction between those electrodes, even under inert conditions. The passivation of defects has proven to be effective for mitigating the effects of defects in MHPs. Herein, the origins and theoretical calculations of the defect tolerance in MHPs and the impact of defects on both the performance and stability of perovskite LEDs are reviewed.

Lead trihalide hybrid materials contain methylammonium (MA) or formamidinium (FA) (or a mixture), or long alkylammonium halides, as alternative organic cations. However, the intrinsic stability of hybrid lead halide perovskites is not very high, and they are chemically unstable when exposed to moisture, light, or heat because of their organic contents and low formation energies. Therefore, although improvements in the chemical stability are crucial, changing the material composition is challenging because it is directly related to the desired application requirements. Fortunately, hybrid lead halide perovskites have a very high tolerance toward changes in physical properties arising from doping or addition of different cations and anions, in many cases showing improved properties. Here, the intrinsic instability of hybrid lead halide perovskites is reviewed in relation to the crystal phase and chemical stability.

The recombination is greatly accelerated by 2 orders of magnitude compared to the GBs without a silicon vacancy. Hydrogen passivation eliminates the trap state and notably delays the charge recombination due to an increased band gap and a shortened coherence time, extending the excited-state lifetime to sub-10 ns.

The overall energy performance of the BIPV insulated glass unit (IGU) including power, thermal and daylighting performance was investigated experimentally. The daily energy conversion efficiency of the active solar cell area was about 15% on sunny days, but it was less than 12% on cloudy days and overcast days. Due to the combined effect of both the semi-transparent PV laminate and the insulated glass unit, the solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) of the BIPV IGU was as low as 0.25, which was much lower than commonly used glazing windows. Daylight analysis by means of high dynamic range (HDR) cameras and daylight glare probability (DGP) indicated that the BIPV IGU could reduce discomfort glare to some extent compared to clear glass windows. The net energy production of the BIPV IGU was estimated without considering the differences in HVAC energy use in this study. The artificial lighting energy consumption was about 431 W h/day while the average BIPV electricity production for the same period was 1940 W h/day. The net power generation was therefore 1509 W h/day for this BIPV IGU in Berkeley, California. Shading tests for the BIPV IGU were also conducted and the results revealed that the vertical configuration of solar cell wiring in the BIPV laminates was much more sensitive to horizontal shading patterns than vertical shading models. Thus, if shading was unavoidable in some cases, a reasonable arrangement of PV strings should be considered to bring down the energy loss as much as possible. Also, the impacts of environmental factors on the energy conversion efficiency of BIPV IGU were analyzed. Specifically, the power output declined by 0.42% of the peak power for each Celsius degree temperature rise.

Our results show that there is a slight shrinkage of the unit cell and a blue-shift of absorption edges upon Mg incorporation into CaNbO2N. The nitrogen contents as well as defects levels can be effectively tuned by altering the content of Mg. More strikingly, photocatalytic oxygen productions are much improved after Mg modifications under visible light irradiation (7%. 420 nm).

The bulk photoluminescence of perovskite films is extremely sensitive to the environment (humidity, light intensity, temperature, atmosphere) and has been shown to undergo rapid photobrightening and photodarkening. Here, we study the changes in photoluminescence behaviour (intensity, wavelength and full-width-at-half-maximum) in both air and nitrogen and correlate this with changes in the crystal structure of the films under illumination. We show that photodarkening is caused by degradation of the perovskite and that both brightening and some degree of darkening are competitive processes occurring simultaneously. During photobrightening the fluorescence emission spectrum red-shifts which can be explained by the halide redistribution and passivation of trap states in the perovskite.

Particularly, high efficiencies are usually obtained by small-area (0.1 cm(2)) lab cells, and thus, the cell performance can be easily over- or underestimated due to inappropriate measurement protocols. Shading masks with well-defined apertures are usually employed to determine the test area of the cells. However, it is found that the aperture area significantly influences the measured photovoltaic parameters of the cells, and has not been quantified. Here we measure and compare the parameters of printable mesoscopic PSCs with shading masks of different shapes and aperture areas. It is identified that extra diffuse light may go through the masks due to the edge effect, and cause an overestimation of the photocurrent density (J(SC)). We establish a model to calibrate the measured J(SC), which is considered as a sum of effective J(SC) (J(SC-eff)) and error J(SC) (J(SC-err)). By fitting the J(SC) measured using apertures of 0.031-0.503 cm(2) with a quadratic function, J(SC-eff) and J(SC-err) are respectively obtained.

However, stability remains a great challenge when TiO2 or other wide bandgap n-type oxide semiconductors are used as the electron transport layer (ETL). The use of carbon such as fullerene (C-60) as an ETL has shown promise with much improved UV stability. But there are two major obstacles to overcome: the first is the difficulty to fabricate C-60 films with full coverage mainly due to the low solubility of fullerene in dichlorobenzene and the second is the hydrophobicity of C-60 that hinders the deposition of pin hole free perovskite films with high crystallinity, intimate contact, and a desired columnar microstructure. In this work, a C-60/ultrathin-TiOx (u-TiOx) bilayer is designed and fabricated as a compact ETL, which restrains the charge recombination at the ETL/perovskite interface and significantly enhances the PSC UV stability. Not only does the introduction of TiOx on top of the C-60 film fill the holes or gaps in the C-60 film, but also it enhances the surface energy benefiting the growth of perovskite with an intimate contact between the ETL and perovskite, which results in an enhanced perovskite crystallization and a reduced charge recombination at the interface. Both the open-circuit voltage and fill factor were largely improved to obtain a PCE of 19.38% with a rigid device. The highest efficiency 14.74% of a larger-area flexible PSC (1.0 cm(2)) based on the bilayer was obtained due to the superior homogeneity of the films. More importantly, by eliminating the negative charge accumulation at the perovskite/ETL interface and suppressing the irreversible moisture-driven decomposition of perovskite materials, the C-60/u-TiOx bilayer-based PSC shows outstanding stability, retaining 83% and 90% of its initial performance after 312 h UV irradiation and 1000 h exposure to ambient air, respectively.",,,,"Cao, Guozhong/E-4799-2011",,,,,,,,,,,,,2050-7488,2050-7496,,,,14-May,2019,7,18,,,,,11086,11094,,10.1039/c9ta02094b,,,,,,,,WOS:000472225200023,,,,,

Photoluminescence spectroscopy performed at cryogenic temperatures indicates the existence of multiple emissive states between 510 nm and 605 nm resulting from a low dimensional phase (LDP) or multiple phases. By mapping the distribution of luminescence across the surface with submicron resolution, we found strong co-localisation of LDP emissive states. At certain blend ratios, emission is seen from both LDP states and methylammonium lead iodide perovskite (around 770 nm). Photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy of mixed-phase films reveals energy transfer, or a cascade, between different LDP states, but this process only occurs inefficiently to the surrounding perovskite. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements demonstrate that LDP excited-state lifetimes decrease as a function of increasing temperature; a process consistent with a thermally-activated charge transfer process.

However, most of them are indirect-band semiconductors with large band gaps which severely limit their development for practical applications. Here we theoretically investigate the intrinsic structures/properties and biaxial strain-induced changes for the monolayer lead-free OIHDP, MA(4)[AgBi]Br-8 (MA = CH3NH3+), and propose to use strain to tune its electronic structures and so optimize its properties. Our results reveal that pristine MA(4)[AgBi]Br-8 has an indirect band gap originated in the inequality of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects on its valence and conduction band extrema and on two directions around the high symmetry point of the Brillouin zone as well, and that the strain tunes the band gap and the Rashba effect, and as a result it mediates the band structure. The band gap of MA(4)[AgBi]Br-8 varies linearly with the strain ratio and a 2% stretching can turn it into a complete direct-band semiconductor. MA(4)[AgBi]Br-8 shows different properties under various strain conditions. Compression strengthens the giant SOC-related characteristics including the SOC-induced indirect band gap and Rashba band-splitting, while moderate stretching not only lessens the band gap but also can enhance the carrier mobility and exciton separation. These results indicate that MA(4)[AgBi]Br-8 has the potential to be a stable and non-toxic multifunctional perovskite material.

Thus, detailed knowledge of additive chemistry is desirous to elucidate passivation mechanisms and facilitate further improvements.

Subsequent incorporation of these impurities at perovskite crystal surfaces or formation of non-perovskite phase inclusions likely influence the perovskite layer morphology and properties which are investigated in Part II. These results reveal a new mechanism by which optoelectronic properties of perovskites can be chemically modified. Additionally, the general concept of acidification of organic molecules solvated to Pb2+ promoting unexpected reactions is applied to explain amine reactions with other additives, such as formic acid.

At present, little is known about the environmental degradation of perovskite films associated with the development of structural defects or open volumes (such as atomic vacancies, voids, crystallographic defects and grain boundary defects) in the lattice, and about the depth dependence of the structural degradation. Therefore, in this work, we use Doppler broadening-positron annihilation spectroscopy (DB-PAS) depth-profiling to gain insight into the structural degradation of CH3NH3PbI3-xClx perovskite when exposed to ambient air. In parallel, we investigate the effect of ultrathin (<1 nm) atomic layer deposited (ALD) Al2O3 processed directly on top of the perovskite as a means to suppress the degradation process. Specifically, we infer that the perovskite degradation involves changes in open volumes in its crystal lattice. This could be caused by the ingress of H2O molecules into the cation vacancies. In parallel, chemical changes in the perovskite films upon decomposition are observed, accompanied by a decrease in the film thickness as a function of air exposure time. When the perovskite films are decorated with ALD Al2O3, the latter delays the thickness reduction of the perovskite layer during air exposure and also suppresses the changes in its open volumes and chemical transformations. Our findings illustrate that an improved understanding of the perovskite degradation process can be obtained using DB-PAS, especially when combined with other thin film characterization techniques, such as X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2050-7526,2050-7534,,,,14-May,2019,7,18,,,,,5275,5284,,10.1039/c8tc06330c,,,,,,,,WOS:000472443000007,,,,,

X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) is a sensitive tool for interface characterization when it is combined with computationally simulated spectra for specific atomic structures.

Two polar orientations, (0001) and (000-1), of the semiconductors are chosen, and both surfaces are terminated with the metal atoms. Each defect leaves behind its unique fingerprint in their XANES.

For the MASI perovskite we observed a 0.7 eV lower ionization potential (IP) as compared to MAPI. Thus, the band edges of MASI are positioned energetically higher with respect to MAPI. In addition, we found MASI to form p-type and MAPI n-type doping. To investigate the impact of different electronic structures on the line up to hole transport materials (HTMs) we performed detailed interface experiments using two commonly used HTMs: spiro-MeOTAD and CuI. The HTMs were step-by-step deposited onto in situ prepared MAPI and MASI layers and characterized via XPS and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) after each deposition step. Our results show that the lower IP of MASI results in blocking barriers at the spiro-MeOTAD interface as well as at the CuI contact. We also propose an estimated band alignment of the two perovskites to the TiO2 front contact by using the vacuum level as the reference energy. The higher lying conduction band maximum (CBM) of MASI as compared to MAPI would limit the open-circuit voltage (V-OC) of a solar cell. Furthermore, for a doped spiro-MeOTAD layer, a V-OC value of up to 750 mV is expected at the MAPI|doped spiro-MeOTAD interface, while it is limited to 210 mV in the case of MASI.

Substitution of lead in halide perovskites is essential to overcome the toxicity concerns and improve the relatively low stability of these materials. In lead-free double perovskites the unit cell is doubled and two divalent lead cations are replaced by mono and trivalent cations. The current main challenge with the double perovskite metal halides lies in overcoming their inherently indirect and disallowed optical transitions. In this review, we have discussed the recent discoveries made in the synthesis of these materials and highlighted how nanocrystals can serve as model systems to explore the schemes of cationic exchange, doping and alloying for engineering the electronic structure of double perovskites. In nanocrystals, the quantum confinement effects can modify the electronic structure and the resulting optical transition, thus increasing the absorption cross-section and emission, which are important properties for optoelectronic devices. Lastly, the enlarged surface to volume ratio in the nanocrystals adds a surface energy term that may enhance the stability of the metastable crystallographic phases. We have reviewed how the nanocrystal can provide information on phases that are inherently stable and investigated how the facile exchange reactions can help in achieving material compositions that are impossible to achieve by any other way. Finally, based on our recent synthetic experience, we have emphasized the similarities between lead-based and lead-free perovskite nanocrystals; we hope that our insight along with a summary of recent progress in this fast-growing field will help to expand the interest in lead-free perovskites towards a greener and brighter future.",,,,,"Khalfin, Sasha/0000-0003-2983-3367",,,,,,,,,,,,2040-3364,2040-3372,,,,14-May,2019,11,18,,,,,8665,8679,,10.1039/c9nr01031a,,,,,,,,WOS:000469245300003,31012899,,,,

The incorporation of OCNRs can increase the work function of the PEDOT:PSS layer, which avoids the energy-level mismatch between the PEDOT:PSS HTL and the HOMO level of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer, leading to a relatively high V-oc of 1.01 V (vs. 0.92 V for the PEDOT:PSS device).

Here, we show that methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)) films can be directly synthesized on all-polymer microcavities via simple addition of a perfluorinated layer which protects the polymer photonic structure from the perovskite processing solvents. The new processing provides microcavities with a quality factor Q = 155, that is in agreement with calculations and the largest value reported so far for fully solution processed perovskite microcavities. Furthermore, the obtained microcavity shows strong spectral and angular redistribution of the the MAPbI(3) photoluminescence spectrum, which shows a 3.5 fold enhanced intensity with respect to the detuned reference.

Our current study shows that OD-perovskite-related structures exhibit a reversible transformation from a transparent state to a colored 3D state upon exposure to humidity. Fluorescence imaging of individual microcrystals reveals that the structural phase transition could be visualized in the solid state, wherein the crystals transform into cubic crystals. The plausible reason for this transformation is proposed to be a dynamic dissolution and recrystallization of the excess methyl ammonium halide with varying humidity. The thermal and moisture stability are found to be greatly enhanced in the transformed 3D perovskite.

To produce perovskite thin films with high device performances, various fabrication methodologies have been developed leading to thin films with different surface structures and crystal morphologies. Tremendous efforts have been devoted to characterizing macro- and microscopic structures within these films to better understand the processing-property-performance relationship. However, their atomic structure and its influence on device performance remains poorly understood. To this end, we employed pair distribution function analysis of X-ray total scattering data to obtain crystallographic and compositional information about methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)) thin films. This analysis revealed a presence of two near-amorphous intermediate phases with local structures that share subtle but significant correlations with the PbI2 precursor and the desired perovskite phase. The structure transformation from these intermediates to the perovskite deviates from the intuitive belief where the molecular cations get inserted between the sheets of layered PbI2 upon the crystallization of perovskites.

This work demonstrates the remarkably slow response time of triple mesoporous carbon-based cells, containing the additive 5-aminovaleric acid iodide (AVA). The photovoltage rise under illumination is 1-2 orders of magnitude longer than has previously been observed for planar and mesoporous TiO2 based devices. Transient photovoltage measurements during this slow rise in voltage show a strong negative transient feature which demonstrates the presence of fast recombination. By analyzing the rate of V-oc rise and the decay of this negative transient, we show a clear link between this recombination process and the limiting of the V-oc. The reduction of recombination over time and the resultant rise in V-oc are influenced by the movement of ions in the perovskite. From temperature-dependent measurements, an activation energy consistent with previous literature values for iodide ion migration is obtained, although the attempt frequency is found to be many orders of magnitude lower than that in pure MAPI perovskite devices. We attribute this to the presence of the AVA molecule inhibiting the movement of ions. The importance of the TiO2/ZrO2 interface in leading to this slow behavior is revealed by studying devices with different architectures with and without the AVA additive.

The prime objective behind the innovation of any photovoltaic device is to yield more energy with easy manufacture and less process cost. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are prominent in the field of photovoltaics, owing to its low material cost, simple fabrication process, and ideal optoelectronic properties. Despite rapid augmentation in progress of PSCs, it is still a bottleneck to produce a high-quality perovskite layer at low temperatures in a short time. Herein, a facile solvent engineering technique is used to produce a high-quality perovskite layer at 50 degrees C in just 30 min. We employed solvent coordination strength to form the intermediate state as well as their sensitive behavior against antisolvent to establish a trade-off between fast and retarded crystallization. Dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO), a traditional co-solvent is used as an additive instead of co-solvent; in contrast, mixed 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) and dimethylacetamide are employed as principal solvents for perovskite precursors. Different volume ratios of DMSO as a fraction of NMP are added to examine the evolution of the perovskite layer at low temperatures. It is noted that the mixed solvent with 30% DMSO shows a pin-hole free, uniform, and compact layer with a strong absorption spectrum. Promisingly, the corresponding device with 30% DMSO shows a high efficiency of 18.19%, which is even comparable to traditionally high-temperature annealed PSCs. These findings may provide a way to produce low temperature annealed, high-quality perovskite films and subsequently facilitate the production of cost-effective and efficient devices.",,,,"Ali, Zulfiqar/F-9236-2019","Ali, Zulfiqar/0000-0003-3615-9403",,,,,,,,,,,,1944-8244,1944-8252,,,,8-May,2019,11,18,,,,,16704,16712,,10.1021/acsami.9b02297,,,,,,,,WOS:000467781100047,30912434,,,,

Therefore, to protect OEDs from outdoor environments, thin-film passivation, which can block harmful elements from reaching organic materials, is required. To meet the demands and trends in encapsulation technologies, in this study, we developed a low-temperature, simple, and effective gas diffusion multibarrier (GDM), which is UV and heat reflective as well as corrosion resistant. The designed UV- and heat-reflective GDM (UHGDM) has a multistacked structure in the form of a UV filter/Ag/gas diffusion barrier (GDB)/polymer based on a dielectric/metal/dielectric (DMD) configuration. First, the DMD structure was used as a heat mirror for infrared reflectance. Second, the bottom dielectric layer of the DMD structure was used as the UV filter, and it consisted of a ZnS/LiF multistacked structure with large differences in refractive indexes. Third, a nanolaminate-based GDB barrier with multi-interfacial and defect-decoupling systems, which achieved a water vapor transmission rate of 1.58 x 10(-5) g/m(2)/day at a thickness of 60 nm, was used as the top dielectric layer of the DMD structure. Finally, an inorganic/organic hybrid polymer layer was coated on the DMD structure to provide corrosion-resistance and waterproofing properties. The fabricated UHGDM showed high transparency in the visible region and excellent reflectance in the UV and IR regions, resulting in excellent UV and heat rejection capability in practical UV and heat reflection tests.

In the present investigation we have developed a novel, simple smart-bottle-humidifier-assisted (SBHA) method for p-type CuSCN i-HEL deposition towards air-thermally stable low-cost PSCs. The developed method is very simple, ambient-air processed, cheap and could be suitable for large-area deposition. The best efficiency based on CuSCN i-HEL devices exhibited was 18.78% with >95% and >85% thermal stability over 1000 hours, respectively at 65 +/- 1 and 85 +/- 1 degrees C. Interestingly, CuSCN i-HEL-based devices show >2000 hours of air-stability and are much more stable than conventional expensive additive-doped spiro-MeOTAD-based PSCs. We also explored this technique for large-area (similar to 1.04 cm(2)) fabrication and it exhibited 18.34% PCE with >85% thermal stability at 85 +/- 1 degrees C over 1000 hours, revealing that the developed method is also suitable for large-area perovskite fabrication.",,,,,"Mali, Dr. Sawanta S./0000-0002-4973-4203",,,,,,,,,,,,2050-7488,2050-7496,,,,7-May,2019,7,17,,,,,10246,10255,,10.1039/c9ta01094g,,,,,,,,WOS:000472183200010,,,,,

Particularly, PSCs exhibit rapid degradation of photovoltaic parameters under ambient air exposure. To estimate the degradation mechanism of PSC under air exposure, we systematically analyzed the relationship between electrical traps of the PSC and its degradation. After 240 h of air exposure to the PSC, its power conversion efficiency degraded to 80% compared to its initial value. The loss mainly originated from reduced current density, which is affected by traps and carrier transport in the disordered semiconducting layer. Capacitance-voltage plots of the PSC showed that the ionic doping from the perovskite layer caused an increased number of trap sites at the buffer layer. Moreover, the extrapolation of temperature dependent open circuit voltage graphs indicated that the trap sites lead to poor carrier transport by increasing recombination losses in the aged device.

IHPs are generally expected to exhibit superior chemical stability over the prevailing hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites that are widely used in optoelectronic devices such as solar cells and lightemitting devices. This is primarily owing to the elimination of weakly-bonded organic components in the IHP crystal structure. Nevertheless, many recent studies have revealed that IHPs still suffer significant issues in chemical instability, and thus, a lot of effort has been made towards the stabilization of IHPs for high-performance devices. In this context, a great deal of interest in the chemistry and perovskite community has been emerging to understand the chemical (in) stability of IHPs and develop engineering strategies for making more robust perovskite devices.

To address these issues, here we introduce a novel, economic and efficient hydrophilic group (C-O & C=O) grafted buffer layer (HGGBL) on a non-wetting hole transporting material (HTM) for perovskite formation. This approach of introducing the buffer layer with grafted hydrophilic groups leads to a decrease in the surface potential and surface tension force of the non-wetting HTM, facilitating the nucleation and growth of perovskite crystals. Also importantly, the carbonyl groups tightly bond with the perovskite via Lewis base sites, leading to a dense, smooth, pinhole-free perovskite film with bulk defects being passivated. Benefiting from these merits, the photovoltaic performance is dramatically boosted from 17.42% to 20.75%, which is among the highest efficiencies of inverted planar PVSCs. In addition, the PVSCs with the HGGBL exhibit excellent reproducibility with negligible hysteresis and superior humidity stability.

Despite the negligible impact on solar cell device performance, this study identifies that proton irradiation is changing the recombination kinetics under low excitation densities profoundly. Dark capacitance-voltage and current-voltage characteristics, photoluminescence spectra as well as photoluminescence and V-oc decays are analyzed in depth. Surprisingly, two fold prolonged PL and V-oc decay times are observed after proton irradiation. Often, such prolongations are attributed to a reduced charge recombination.

Impedance spectroscopy measurements show that these treatments reduce the recombination in the PSCs, leading to a champion device with power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.2%, an open circuit voltage of 1152 mV and negligible hysteresis.

Nevertheless, a large number of ionic defects within perovskite absorber can serve as non-radiative recombination center to limit the performance of PSCs. Here, organic donor--acceptor (D--A) molecules with different electron density distributions are employed to efficiently passivate the defects in the perovskite films. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis shows that the strong electron donating N,N-dibutylaminophenyl unit in a molecule causes an increase in the electron density of the passivation site that is a carboxylate group, resulting in better binding with the defects of under-coordinated Pb2+ cations. Carrier lifetime in the perovskite films measured by the time-resolved photoluminescence spectrum is also prolonged by an increase in donation ability of the D--A molecules. As a consequence, these benefits contribute to an increase of 80 mV in the open circuit voltage of the devices, enabling a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.43%, in comparison with PCE of 18.52% for the control device.

However commercial development is seriously hindered by the instability of the perovskite, especially under moisture conditions. Therefore it is crucial to gain clear understanding of the mechanism of degradation of organic-inorganic perovskite in order to achieve stable perovskite devices. In this paper, the formation and the degradation of perovskite film on different charge transport layers such as a compact TiO2 layer, compact ZnO layer, and ZnO foil, Si nanowires, and porous Si are studied. In addition, density functional theory studies are carried out to better understand the interaction between the perovskite film and substrates. Experimental and theoretical results are combined to draw more reliable conclusion regarding the degradation mechanism. Most notably, the investigations show that the interaction between the iodine (I) atom in the perovskite layer and substrate determine the stability of perovskite cells. As a result, Si has minimum interaction with I atoms and shows maximum stability, while perovskite film degrades on TiO2 film almost immediately.",,,,"Amiri, Omid/W-9959-2019","Amiri, Omid/0000-0002-5781-4086",,,,,,,,,,,,2196-7350,,,,,MAY,2019,6,9,,,,,,,1900134,10.1002/admi.201900134,,,,,,,,WOS:000471810800017,,,,,

In addition, such randomization may also severely limit the electronic device performance.

Introduction of GBs into CsPbBr3 accelerates the recombination, while GBs doping with chlorine notably slow it down. Importantly, GBs do not create deep electron traps because they only narrow the band gap slightly. GBs localize electron wave functions at boundaries and activate additional phonon modes, leading to an enhanced NA coupling and a shortened coherence time. Consequently, the interplay between the three competitive factors accelerates the recombination by a factor of 2. Chlorine doping diminishes the mixing of electron and hole wave functions and reduces the NA coupling, which also shortens the coherence time further by introducing higher-frequency phonons, notably delaying the recombination.

Using atomic force microscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, both great surface uniformity and favorable band alignment of low-temperature processed SnO2 layer have been observed, which are responsible for the device performance. Furthermore, deep electronic-trap states at the SnO2/perovskite interface are investigated via impedance analysis. Compared to the cells processed over 160 degrees C, low-temperature processed cells exhibit trap states shifting toward the bandedge and reduced trap density, verifying that controlling the interfacial trap states holds a dominance on the open-circuit voltage and is a critical requisite to enable efficient perovskite solar cells.

However, the bulk form of the cubic phase CsPbX3, which offers moderate direct bandgaps, is metastable at room temperature and tends to transform into a tetragonal or orthorhombic phase. Here, our density functional theory calculation results found that the surface energies of the cubic phase are smaller than those of the orthorhombic phase, although the bulk counterpart of the cubic phase is less stable than that of the orthorhombic phase. These results suggest a surface stabilization strategy to maintain the stability of the cubic phase at room temperature that an enlarged portion of surfaces shall change the relative stability of the two phases in nanostructured CsPbX3. This strategy, which may potentially solve the long-standing stability issue of cubic CsPbX3, was demonstrated to be feasible by our calculations in zero-, one-, and two-dimensional nanostructures. In particular, confined sizes from few to tens of nanometers could keep the cubic phase as the most thermally favored form at room temperature. Our predicted values in particular cases, such as the zero-dimensional form of CsPbI3, are highly consistent with experimental values, suggesting that our model is reasonable and our results are reliable.

The formalism deals with nonradiative recombination through the definition of the luminescence extraction efficiency. Using our general formalism, we find that the limiting efficiency of a tandem cell becomes much less dependent on exact bandgap combination when luminescent coupling is considered and proceed to consider two technologically important examples of current-mismatched tandem solar cells. We find that a series-connected GaAs on a silicon tandem cell can be more efficient than the underlying silicon cell alone, if the luminescence extraction efficiency of the GaAs junction is sufficient. An analysis of luminescent coupling in a perovskite on a silicon tandem cell shows that the efficiency penalty for a perovskite bandgap below the optimum value can be mitigated if the luminescence extraction efficiency is high.

Herein, we demonstrate an effective and practical strategy to overcome these challenges. Conjugated n-type polymeric materials are mixed together with PCBM to form a homogeneous bulk-mixed (HBM) continuous film with high electron mobility and suitable energy level. HBM film is found to completely cap the perovskite surface to enhance the electron extraction. The critical electron capture radius of the HBM decreases to 12.52 nm from 14.89 nm of PCBM due to the large relative permittivity, resulting in reduced nonradiative recombination at perovskite/HBM interface. The efficiency of inverted PSCs with HBM ETLs exceeds 20.6% with a high fill factor of 0.82. Further, the stability of devices is improved owing to the high hydrophobicity of the HBM ETLs. Under ambient air condition after 45 days, the efficiency of inverted PSCs based on HBM remains 80% of the initial value. This is significantly higher than the control devices which retain only 48% of the initial value under similar aging conditions.

Wide band-gap materials have been studied more extensively, compared to low bandgap materials, which introduces limitations to the applications of oxides. Study of low band-gap semiconducting oxides can propel the usage of oxides in a wider range of applications. Here, the electronic, structural, and optical properties of Zn2Mo3O8 (ZMO) are investigated. Stoichiometric polycrystalline films of ZMO are deposited using pulsed laser deposition system at room temperature. The unintentionally n-doped films show a hall electron mobility of 0.7 cm(2)V(-1) s(-1) and have a bandgap of 2.1 eV. The photoelectron spectra contain complex peak profiles which are explained to be a manifestation of final state effects. The orbital contribution to the valence band of ZMO is probed using resonant photoelectron spectroscopy, which confirms that the valence band is composed of Mo 4d levels. The conduction and valence band edges are predicted to be at 4.2 eV and 6.3 eV, so most of the conventional wide band-gap oxides can be used as hole-blocking layers with ZMO. Under A.M. 1.5 illumination, single-sided Schottky diode with Fluorine-doped fin oxide/TiO2/ZMO/Au structure shows no photovoltaic action, possibly due to high exciton binding energy and low carrier drift lengths. However, the Schottky device shows a higher current under illumination, which suggests that with improvement in carrier drift lengths, ZMO can find applications in low-cost optoelectronic devices on flexible substrates like plastic or Polyethylene terephthalate.",,,,,"Jain, Manish/0000-0001-9329-6434",,,,,,,,,,,,0040-6090,,,,,1-May,2019,677,,,,,,95,102,,10.1016/j.tsf.2019.03.023,,,,,,,,WOS:000464982900015,,,,,

Their optically lossless material (TiO2) allows the structures to be patterned in the final processing steps, integrated in the cells' top n contact, therefore not increasing the surface area of the PV layers and not degrading the electric performance via recombination. Therefore, this strategy circumvents the typical compromise of state-of-the-art LT approaches between optical improvements and electrical deterioration, which is particularly relevant for PSCs since their main recombination is caused by surface defects.

Polythiophenes are a promising class of hole-transport layer (HTL) materials that could satisfy these requirements. However, PSCs fabricated using conventional poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) HTLs show limited efficiencies of < 16% owing to the shallow highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level and poor charge extraction ability of P3HT. Herein, we demonstrate that the fluorinated polythiophene derivative FEH is a suitable replacement for P3HT and a promising HTL material for perovskite solar cells. The FEH was found to have a deeper HOMO and exhibit more efficient charge-extraction ability at the perovskite/HTL interface than P3HT. This is attributed to the electron withdrawing nature of the fluorine atoms in FEH and its ability to form more uniform films on the perovskite layer. Thus, when FEH was employed as the HTL, the corresponding PSC showed an improved efficiency of 18.0% and an enhancement of all device parameters compared with control devices fabricated using P3HT (10.8%) and Spiro-OMeTAD (17.0%) HTLs.

The NiOx: rGO based PVSC achieves a promising PCE of 19.1% with a significantly improved FF from 73% to 81% compared to the device using solely NiOx.

The innovative approach involves a facile one-step spin-coating of AlCl3 solution on top of the NRs. The polar (001) planes of ZnO were selectively etched due to the acidic nature of the AlCl3 solution, resulting in the transformation of NRs to NTs. At the same time, effective Al doping into the NTs was accomplished. Surface morphological analysis revealed gradual formation of NTs through additional AlCl3 coatings. Evidence of Al dopant inclusion and uniform distribution within NTs was established from XPS, XRD, Raman and EELS elemental mapping analyses. The HRTEM image and SAED pattern showed that the AZO NTs have a high-quality crystalline structure. Higher transmittance and a blue shift in absorption edge can also be observed in doped films indicating band gap broadening. A new green emission in the PL spectra of AZO NTs emerged due to the formation of oxygen vacancies. Most importantly, the AZO NTs showed higher electrical conductivity and electron mobility values compared with undoped ZnO NRs. Steady-state PL spectra of perovskite films on top of AZO films were quenched stronger than those of ZnO NRs, indicating faster electron transfer in the perovskite/AZO NTs interface.

Here, the planar CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI(3)) perovskite solar cells (PeSCs) with ZnO as the electron-transporting layer (ETL) were fabricated. By varying the wide range of MAPbI(3) active-layer thickness, we estimate their device parameters and external quantum efficiencies in addition to internal absorption spectra (Q) by means of the transfer matrix method. Furthermore, the spectrally and spatially resolved internal quantum efficiencies (IQEs) as a function of the active-layer thickness within PeSCs were calculated, and the relationship between IQE and device parameters extracted from the current voltage (J-V) behaviors was discussed. It was found that the PeSC with MAPbI(3) film thickness around 303 nm has a relatively high IQE and PCE, indicating that there is more power loss of PeSCs when the thickness of the MAPbI(3) layer is either less or more than about 300 nm. Furthermore, time-resolved photoluminescence together with the thickness-dependent morphology and crystallinity of the MAPbI(3) film demonstrate that there are two power loss processes in the fabricated PeSCs: one at the ZnO/MAPbI(3) interface and the other in bulk.

Hence, to address this issue, a new conductive polymer additive of polyaniline (PANI), which has special electrical and optical properties, was employed. Under the multiple effects of PANI, the quality of perovskite films was markedly enhanced, with outstanding crystalline structure, improved light absorption and uniform surface morphology, leading to faster PL quenching and charge transfer. As a result, the device with PANI exhibited a dramatically improved PCE from 16.96% (pristine) to 19.09% and reduced hysteresis behavior. The aging tests indicated that PANI perovskite devices show stronger humidity and heat stability, and they exhibited a larger water contact angle than the pristine perovskite. In particular, a PANI perovskite device maintained 86% of its initial PCE after aging under 50% RH for about 1600 h.

LSCs require luminophores that absorb large fractions of the solar spectrum, emit photons into a light-capture medium with high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs), and do not absorb their own photoluminescence. Luminescent nanocrystals (NCs) with near or above unity PLQYs and Stokes shifts large enough to avoid self-absorption losses are well-suited to meet these needs. In this work, we describe LSCs based on quantum-cutting Yb3+:CsPb(Cl1-xBrx)(3) NCs that have documented PLQYs as high as approximate to 200%. Through a combination of solution-phase 1D LSC measurements and modeling, we demonstrate that Yb3+:CsPbCl3 NC LSCs show negligible intrinsic reabsorption losses, and we use these data to model the performance of large-scale 2D LSCs based on these NCs.

The increase of Br-doping content leads to the downshifting of both valence band (VB) position (indicated by XPS) and Fermi level (illustrated by KPFM). The energy level shifts are most probably due to the increase of Br 4p orbital content in VB and the change of self-doping levels.

The influence of thermal stress and the encapsulation (lamination) process on cell performance is investigated.

The Bi dopant located at the grain boundaries to modify the carrier channel near grain boundaries, which is observed via scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy, efficiently reduces ion migration and facilitates charge transport. In addition, the Bi dopant can also passivate the defects in bulk MAPbI(3), increasing the polarization effect of MAPbI(3) which is demonstrated by the capacitance-frequency measurement, thus greatly enhancing the mobility of Bi-doped MAPbI(3).

Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) has been applied as a powerful tool to probe the electrical potential distribution of perovskite films and devices, providing fundamental insights into their charge-carrier properties. When measuring the material photoresponses, various approaches have been employed to illuminate the samples. Here, we measured the surface potential of the layer in the regular mesoporous structure (CH3NH3PbI3/m-TiO2/c-TiO2/FTO) and inverted planar structure (CH3NH3PbI3/NiO/FTO) devices via KPFM. Effects of two representative illumination methods are compared-illumination from top, and from underneath through the transparent glass substrate. By comparing the variation in surface potential under two illumination methods, the surface potential of the perovskite-absorbing layer in a regular structure is higher than that in the inverted structure. The potential difference in two structures implies that the photogenerated charge carriers are injected to the TiO2 electron-transport layer and NiO hole-transport layer, resulting in positive charges and negative charges accumulated in the perovskite-absorbing layer. We demonstrated that the illumination direction has an impact on the surface potential measurement.

Specific to solid surfaces, the coordination number and coordination strength can be gradually changed by applying stress. Moreover, the interactions of SCN- with the counter cations and solvent (water) can modify its coordination mode, which generally favors sulfur coordination owing to the stronger interaction between the more electronegative dangling nitrogen and the counter cations or water. The coordination of SCN- could modify the electronic and geometric properties of the solid surface, which would benefit the design of catalysts. For example, the SCN- coordination improved the conductivity of beta-Ni(OH)(2), which is potentially useful in electrocatalysis. This work sheds light on the coordination mode of SCN- with significant implications on a variety of applications that can exploit the coordination chemistry.",,,,"; Liu, Tongfa/M-2539-2016","WANG, Zheng/0000-0002-7560-2618; Liu, Tongfa/0000-0001-6633-0502; Bai, Fu-Quan/0000-0001-9398-1407",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-7447,,,,,11-Apr,2019,123,14,,,,,9282,9291,,10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b01457,,,,,,,,WOS:000464768600090,,,,,

Here, the perovskite films with enlarged crystal grain size and decreased defect density are fabricated by introducing the extremely low-cost and green polymer, ethyl cellulose (EC), into the perovskite layer. The addition of EC triggers hydrogen bonding interactions between EC and the perovskite, passivating the charge defect traps at the grain boundaries. The long chain of EC further acts as a scaffold for the perovskite structure, eliminating the annealing-induced lattice strain during the film fabrication process. The resulting devices with the EC additive exhibit a remarkably enhanced average power conversion efficiency from 17.11 to 19.27% and an improvement of all device parameters. The hysteresis index is found to decrease by three times from 0.081 to 0.027, which is attributed to suppressed ion migration and surface charge trapping.

Experiments have shown that oxygen undermines perovskite chemical stability, but enhances charge carrier lifetimes. Focusing on CH3NH3PbI3, which has become the classic material, we demonstrate how and why charge carrier lifetimes change in the presence of oxygen, by carrying out nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations combined with time-domain ab initio density functional theory. Calculations have shown that superoxide and peroxide are the common forms of oxygen interacting with CH3NH3PbI3 and that oxygen most readily interacts with iodine vacancies on the perovskite surface. We establish that the iodine vacancy decreases charge carrier lifetimes, because it localizes both electrons and holes, increasing their overlap. By passivating the vacancy, the oxygen species separate electrons and holes and increase the lifetimes by more than an order of magnitude. Passivating the vacancy by water and Lewis bases, such as pyridine and thiophene, also leads to electron-hole separation. The energy gap changes only by a few percent; however, the nonadiabatic coupling becomes much weaker, and the quantum coherence time decreases significantly. The detailed time-domain atomistic analysis of the excited state dynamics rationalizes why the photogenerated charge carriers in perovskites are robust to defects and interactions with chemical species present in air, such as water and oxygen, even though they undermine perovskite chemical stability.

Solution fabrication process shows that the recorded power conversion efficiency (PCE) is 23.7%, however, large scale fabrication suffers the inevitable toxic solvent, preventing it from implementing the green commercialization. As one of the matured large-scale fabrication techniques, the vapor deposition is recently found to promise the green fabrication of perovskite thin film without toxic solvent. However, the PCE based on vapor deposition is considerably lower than that based on solution fabrication because of ineffective regulation methods of the perovskite films. So, there is intensive requirement for optimizing the growth of perovskite in vapor deposition for improving PCE, especially, developing a kind of quality regulation method of the perovskite films. In this study, we provide a method of adjusting grain size in vapor deposition method. The grain size optimization of MAPbI(3) films is realized by simply modulating the reaction temperature between PbI2 films and MAI vapor. We set the reaction temperature to be 140 degrees C, 160 degrees C, 180 degrees C and 200 degrees C separately and establish the relationship between reaction time and grain size during the complete conversion of PbI2 film into MAPbI(3) film. We find that the average grain size of the film increases first with growth temperature increasing from 140 degrees C to 180 degrees C and then decrease at 200 degrees C, giving an average grain size of 0.81 mu m and a largest grain size of about 2 mu m at 180 degrees C. The defect density of perovskite film is deduced from the space charge limited current model, showing that it decreases from 5.90 x 10 16 cm(-3) at 140 degrees C to 2.66 x 10(16) cm(-3) at 180 degrees C. Photovoltaic devices with structure FTO/TiO2/C-60/MAPbI(3)/spiro-OMeTAD/Au are fabricated to demonstrate the performance. It is found that the devices with an active area of 0.045 cm(2) show that with the increase of grain size, the average PCE increases from 14.00% to 17.42%, and the best device shows that its PCE is 17.80% with 4.04% hysteresis index.

Instead, they are a natural consequence of slow transients mainly in forward current of the diode upon ion displacement when changing voltage. The transient current leads to a positive or negative 'capacitance' dependent on the sign of its gradient.

Here we report a theoretical study of the pathways for NRR in an archetypal lead halide perovskite: CsPbBr3.

The energies of the minimal energy CIs, corrected for both dynamical electron correlation and spin-orbit coupling, are well above the bulk band gap of CsPbBr3, suggesting that these intersections do not provide efficient pathways for NRR in this material.

These so-called intrinsic magnetic field effects (MFEs) can be observed in linear and non-linear regimes under one-photon and two-photon excitations in both low- and high-orbital materials. On the other hand, spin injection can be realized to influence spin-dependent excited states and electrical conduction via organic/ferromagnetic hybrid interface, leading to extrinsic MFEs. In last decades, MFEs have been serving as a unique experimental tool to reveal spin-dependent processes in excited states, electrical transport, and polarization in light-emitting diodes, solar cells, memories, field-effect transistors, and lasing devices. Very recently, they provide critical understanding on the operating mechanisms in advanced organic optoelectronic materials such as thermally activated delayed fluorescence light-emitting materials, non-fullerene photovoltaic bulk-heterojunctions, and organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites. While MFEs were initially realized by operating spin states in organic semiconducting materials with delocalized pi electrons under negligible orbital momentum, recent studies indicate that MFEs can also be achieved under strong orbital momentum and Rashba effect in light emission, photovoltaics, and dielectric polarization. The transition of MFEs from the spin regime to the orbital regime creates new opportunities to versatilely control light-emitting, photovoltaic, lasing, and dielectric properties by using long-range Coulomb and short-range spin-spin interactions between orbitals. This article reviews recent progress on MFEs with the focus on elucidating fundamental mechanisms to control optical, electrical, optoelectronic, and polarization behaviors via spin-dependent excited states, electrical transport, and dielectric polarization.

Characterization revealed that in the C3N5 polymer, two s-heptazine units are bridged together with azo linkage, which constitutes an entirely new and different bonding fashion from g-C3N4 where three heptazine units are linked together with tertiary nitrogen. Extended conjugation due to overlap of azo nitrogens and increased electron density on heptazine nucleus due to the aromatic pi network of heptazine units lead to an upward shift of the valence band maximum resulting in bandgap reduction down to 1.76 eV. XRD, He-ion imaging, HR-TEM, EELS, PL, fluorescence lifetime imaging, Raman, FTIR, TGA, KPFM, XPS, NMR and EPR clearly show that the properties of C3N5 are distinct from pristine carbon nitride (g-C3N4). When used as an electron transport layer (ETL) in MAPbBr(3) based halide perovskite solar cells, C3N5 outperformed g-C3N4, in particular generating an open circuit photovoltage as high as 1.3 V, while C(3)N(5 )blended with MA(x)FA(1-x)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)(3) perovskite active layer achieved a photoconversion efficiency (PCE) up to 16.7%. C3N5 was also shown to be an effective visible light sensitizer for TiO2 photoanodes in photoelectrochemical water splitting. Because of its electron-rich character, the C3N5 material displayed instantaneous adsorption of methylene blue from aqueous solution reaching complete equilibrium within 10 min, which is significantly faster than pristine g-C3N4 and other carbon based materials.

However, there is limited information about their inherent heat, light, and air stability and how different parameters such as the inorganic layer number and length of organic spacer molecule affect stability. To gain deeper understanding on the matter we have expanded the family of 2D R-P perovskites, by utilizing pentylamine (PA)(2)(MA)(n-1)PbnI3n+1 (n = 1-5, PA = CH (3) (CH (2) ) (4) NH (+)(3), C 5) and hexylamine (HA)(2)(MA)(n-1)PbnI3n+1 (n = 1-4, HA = CH3(CH2)(5)NH3+, C6) as the organic spacer molecules between the inorganic slabs, creating two new series of layered materials, for up to n = 5 and 4 layers, respectively. The resulting compounds were extensively characterized through a combination of physical and spectroscopic methods, including single crystal X-ray analysis. High resolution powder X-ray diffraction studies using synchrotron radiation shed light for the first time to the phase transitions of the higher layer 2D R-P perovskites. The increase in the length of the organic spacer molecules did not affect their optical properties; however, it has a pronounced effect on the air, heat, and light stability of the fabricated thin films. An extensive study of heat, light, and air stability with and without encapsulation revealed that specific compounds can be air stable (relative humidity (RH) = 20-80% +/- 5%) for more than 450 days, while heat and light stability in air can be exponentially increased by encapsulating the corresponding films.

Here, a simple surface modification strategy for low-cost and stable cuprous oxide (Cu2O) quantum dots is proposed, which utilizes a silane coupling agent. The modified Cu2O can be directly deposited on the perovskite film as the top HTL without decomposing the perovskite to maintain an n-i-p structure. The efficiency (18.9%) of PSCs with surface-modified Cu2O as the HTL is significantly higher than that (11.9%) of PSCs with unmodified Cu2O, which is also the record efficiency for a Cu2O-based perovskite solar cell in n-i-p structure. The enhanced performance of PSCs is attributed to the remarkably enhanced film properties achieved through surface modification.

Applying this ""Suns-V-OC"" technique to perovskite cells is problematic since the V-OC evolves with time in a way that depends on the previously applied bias (V-pre), bias light intensity, device architecture and processing route. Here, we show that the dominant recombination mechanism in two structurally similar CH3 NH3PbI3 devices containing either mesoporous Al2O3 or TiO2 layers can be identified from the signature of the transient ideality factor following application of a forward bias, V-pre to the device in the dark. The transient ideality factor is measured by monitoring the evolution of V-OC as a function of time at different light intensities. The initial values of ideality found using this technique are consistent with estimates of the ideality factor obtained from measurements of photoluminescence vs light intensity and electroluminescence vs current density. Time-dependent simulations of the measurement on modeled devices, which include the effects of mobile ionic charge, reveal that this initial value can be correlated to an existing zero-dimensional model while steady-state values must be analyzed taking into account the homogeneity of carrier populations throughout the absorber layer. The analysis shows that Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination through deep traps at the charge-collection interfaces is dominant in both architectures of measured device. Using transient photovoltage measurements directly following illumination on bifacial devices, we further show that the perovskite-electron-transport-layer interface extends throughout the mesoporous TiO2 layer, consistent with a transient ideality signature corresponding to SRH recombination in the bulk of the film.

In this work, the origin of the graded phase distribution is explained, and the roles of DMSO in Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites film crystallization are systematically investigated. DMSO was found to homogenize the film composition, and therefore suppress the proportion of the small-n 2D phases. Through X-ray diffraction and grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering measurements, it has been revealed that an intermediate phase is responsible for the less graded films and rationalizes the effect of DMSO in film crystallization. More importantly, solar cells with an efficiency exceeding 14% are fabricated by this facile method, which deliver good light, thermal, and ambient stability without encapsulation.

The devices using air- and O-2-annealed NiO films show better photovoltaic performance than the N-2- and Ar-annealed ones, mostly due to large difference in photocurrent density (J(sc)) of approximate to 20mAcm(-2) for air and O-2 vs approximate to 15mAcm(-2) for N-2 and Ar.

Our results prove that injection takes place from hot states in the valence band making this efficient even for HTMs with higher ionization energy than that of the perovskite.

Remarkable progress in device performance has been achieved for last few years. Their high performance in combination with low production cost puts the perovskite optoelectronics under serious consideration for possible commercialization. A fundamental question that remains unanswered is whether these materials can sustain their optoelectronic properties during harsh and prolonged operational conditions of the devices. A major concern stems from an unprecedented and unique feature of perovskite materials, which is migration of ionic species (or charged defects). Recent studies have indicated that the ion migration might be a limit factor for long-term operational stability of the devices. In this regard, herein we have reviewed important studies on discovery, quantification, and mitigation of the ion migration process in metal halide perovskite materials. A possible emerging application using the ion migration is also briefly introduced.

Tuning the bandgap by cation and anion compositional mixing, for instance, is paramount to target different optoelectronic segments, from light emitting applications to tandem solar cells. However, structural and photo instabilities, and phase segregation come along, imposing a severe control on the material composition and structure. Here we develop highly uniform alloy of mixed cation FA((1-x))Cs(x)PbBr(3) perovskite thin films pushing for the first time the Cs content up to 30%. In contrast to what has been reported so far, this composition leads to a high quality crystalline film, maintaining a single cubic phase arrangement. In addition, a remarkably high robustness against moisture and phase purity is observed. The experimental finding is also supported by density functional theory simulations, demonstrating at the atomistic level Cs segregation starting from Cs concentration around 37.5%. Beyond that, phase segregation happens, leading to formation of an unstable pure Cs-rich region. Low temperature photoluminescence (PL) measurements reveal that the addition of Cs eliminates the non-radiative channel into mid-gap traps, as evident by the lack of the broad emission band, often associated with recombination of self-trapped exciton, present for 0% Cs. This, in turn, reduces the non-radiative recombination losses which manifests as high performance solar cells. Indeed, when embodied in solar devices, Cs incorporation leads to enhanced device performances, with an open circuit voltage beyond 1.33 V.

However, these PSCs exhibit photoinduced instability in the course of their current-voltage measurements. In this work, we study the light-induced behavior in CH3NH3PbI3-xClx films in situ, by employing wide-field photoluminescence (PL) microscopy to obtain both the spatially and temporally resolved PL images simultaneously. Along with the increase in the PL intensity under continuous illumination, some areas render PL inactive. By characterizing the excitation energy dependent long-time PL decay behavior, we suggest that the PL quenching can be ascribed to a localized accumulation of iodide ions driven by the optical field. This ion localization leads to an enhancement of non-radiative recombination. The appearance of the PL inactive areas in the perovskite film impedes its photovoltaic device performance approaching the theoretical maximum PCE.

The linear Boltzmann transport equation is applied to obtain the perturbation to the electron distribution by different scattering mechanisms. The mobility is mainly limited by the deformation-potential interaction with long-wavelength acoustic vibrations at low carrier concentrations. At high concentrations, ionized impurity scattering becomes stronger. The electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient are calculated accurately over various ranges of temperature and carrier concentration. The lattice thermal conductivity of PbI2, 0.065 W m(-1) K-1 at 300 K, is the lowest among other 2D thermoelectric materials. Such ultralow thermal conductivity is attributed to large atomic mass, weak interatomic bonding, strong anharmonicity, and localized vibrations in which the vast majority of heat is trapped. These electrical and phonon transport properties enable a high thermoelectric figure of merit over 1 for both p-type and n-type doping from 300 K to 900 K. A maximum zT of 4.9 is achieved at 900 K with an electron concentration of 1.9 x 10(12) cm(-2).

In this paper, the (CH3NH3)(3)Bi(2)I(9 )was doped with Cl- and a series of (CH3NH3)(3)Bi2I9-xClx films were prepared. The effects of different doping amounts on the microstructure, photovoltaic properties and ferroelectric properties were systematically investigated.

The photoelectric conversion efficiency of (CH3NH3)(3)Bi2I9-xClx raises with the increase of doping content. For example, the photoelectric conversion efficiency of (CH3NH3)(3)Bi2I3Cl6 is 0.473%.

In this work, the effect of pressing on the performance of mesoporous PSCs is studied. Cells with the state-of-the-art architecture glass/FTO/c-TiO2/mp-TiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/gold are used in this study. It is found that pressing under the condition typically used for encapsulation is beneficial for these PSCs, improving their PCE consistently by more than 7% relative on average. The effect of pressing was characterized by light current density- voltage measurement (LJV) time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The PCE enhancement is due to an improved interface resulting in a higher fill factor, lower recombination, and lower hysteresis. It is found that pressing pressure of 400-500 mbar is appropriate; higher pressure at 1000 mbar is detrimental. Moreover, pressure must be maintained to maintain the PCE improvement.

Here, the effects of surface modification of SnO2 ETLs using polar phosphonic acids are investigated, including the effects on work function, surface energy, device performance, and device stability in inert atmosphere. The phosphonic acid modifications did not have a large effect on V-OC; however, a sharp decrease in the overall device performance was found, mostly due to reduced fill factors. When exposed to conditions of low oxygen concentration, the phosphonic acid surface modified devices yielded current-voltage (J-V) curves with considerably lower hysteresis than those based on unmodified SnO2.

In traditional sequential vapor approaches, perovskite films suffer from the impingement of hot organic vapor molecules. As a consequence, interfacial voids and structural faults were frequently observed in thick perovskite films (>500 nm) that were formed from simultaneous surface and interfacial nucleation of the perovskite phase. Here, the surface nucleation was suppressed using thermally stable amorphous precursors that could withstand the impingement of hot molecular vapors. We compared the stability of several PbI2 adducts and observed that the PbI2-(1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone, DMI)) adduct was stable at elevated temperature in air for tens of minutes, providing a sufficient time window for sequential processes. First-principle calculation suggests that DMI adsorbed on PbI2 needs more energy to desorb than DMSO. The adduct films were converted into perovskite phases using vapor exchange deposition (VED). The perovskite phases prepared via VED comprised vertically monolithic grains, indicating a heterogeneous nucleation mechanism. The deposited perovskite films were dense and free of pinholes. Therefore, the shunt resistance of the devices was much higher than those of devices made via traditional vapor approaches. By connecting the ITO electrode symmetrically, we observed that the series resistance varied little with the increase of the device area. Moreover, uniform and kinetically controlled supply of the vapor over a large area facilitated the scale-up of the device area. Finally, we obtained PSCs with power conversion efficiency of 19.2% and 19.0% over active areas of 0.1125 cm(2) and 1.8 cm(2), respectively.

UV degradation is one of the most severe issues, chiefly caused by TiO2's photogenerated electrons that decompose the perovskite absorber material, coupled with the additional intrinsic degradation of this material under UV exposure. The solution presented here can minimize this effect while boosting the Down-Shifting cells' generated photocurrent, by making use of combined light-trapping and luminescent down-shifting effects capable of changing the harmful UV radiation to higher wavelengths that do not affect the stability and can be effectively ""trapped"" in the cell.

Cesium lead iodide (CsPbI3), for example, typically exists as the insulating delta-phase at room temperature but can adopt the narrow-bandgap gamma-phase when the crystal size is reduced to the nanometer length scale. Here we advance a fundamental understanding of the role of nanoconfinement in CsPbI3 polymorph stabilization through a combination of X-ray diffraction and temperature-dependent photoluminescence. Using a wet annealing method to directly form gamma-CsPbI3 from solution in the cylindrical nanopores of anodized aluminum oxide, we discovered that nanoconfinement lowers the delta-gamma solid-state phase transition temperature from 448 K in the bulk to 370 K. Once formed, nanoconfined gamma-CsPbI3 crystals were found to be stable across the temperature range of 4-610 K and upon an unprecedented one year of air exposure at room temperature. Taking advantage of the nanoconfinement-induced suppression of phase transitions, we report for the first time a detailed analysis of electron- phonon interactions in gamma-CsPbI3 via temperature-dependent photoluminescent measurements. In-depth analysis of the temperature-dependent peak broadening revealed electron-phonon interactions to be dominated by Frohlich scattering, similar to that observed in inorganic-organic hybrid perovskite systems.

It is believed that this extensively modified device and low-cost architecture will compellingly lead to the timely commercialization of perovskite solar cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1754-5692,1754-5706,,,,1-Apr,2019,12,4,,,,,1265,1273,,10.1039/c8ee02958j,,,,,,,,WOS:000465275800026,,,,,

Currently, such understanding is limited, restricting the power conversion efficiencies of OMHP solar cells from reaching their Shockley-Queisser limit. In more mature semiconductors like Si, the knowledge of defects is one of the major factors in successful technological implementation. This knowledge and its control can make a paradigm shift in the development of OMHP devices. Here, we report on deep level (DL) defects and their effect on the free charge transport properties of the single crystalline methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr(3)) perovskite. To determine DL activation energy and capture cross section, we used photo-Hall effect spectroscopy (PHES) with enhanced illumination in both steady-state and dynamic regimes. This method has shown to be convenient due to the direct DL visualization by sub-bandgap photo-excitation of trapped carriers. DLs with activation energies of E-V + 1.05 eV, E-V + 1.5 eV, and E-V + 1.9 eV (or E-C - 1.9 eV) were detected. The hole capture cross section of sigma(h) = 4 x 10(-17) cm(2) is found using photoconductivity relaxation after sub-bandgap photo-excitation. Here, our experimental results demonstrate the existence of DL defects responsible for non-radiative recombination and their positions inside the bandgap for the first time. Additionally, the transport properties of single crystal MAPbBr(3) are investigated by Time of Flight (ToF) measurements at several biases. These measurements further confirm the increase of Hall mobility and the enhancement of hole transport produced by sub-bandgap illumination in MAPbBr(3) devices. The analysis of charge carrier transport by ToF measurements in combination with the energy of DLs identified by PHES can explain the long hole carrier lifetime in MAPbBr(3) devices, while the electron carrier lifetime is largely affected by trap-assisted recombination. Here, our studies provide strong evidence for deep levels in OMHPs and open a richer picture of the role and properties of deep levels in MAPbBr(3) single crystals as a system model for the first time. The deeper knowledge of the electronic structure of OMHPs could open further opportunities in the development of more feasible technologies. Indeed, knowledge of the exact positions of DLs is beneficial in controlling these defects by crystal growth modification to eliminate these defects as was done for classical inorganic semiconductors, for example, in Si, GaAs, and CdTe development.",,,,"Ahmadi, Mahshid/P-3266-2019; Grill, Roman/A-2109-2008; Musiienko, Artem/Q-5341-2017; Belas, Eduard/I-7735-2017","Ahmadi, Mahshid/0000-0002-3268-7957; Grill, Roman/0000-0002-4615-8909; Musiienko, Artem/0000-0002-2259-8387; Belas, Eduard/0000-0001-5312-5104",,,,,,,,,,,,1754-5692,1754-5706,,,,1-Apr,2019,12,4,,,,,1413,1425,,10.1039/c9ee00311h,,,,,,,,WOS:000465275800021,,,,,

Interestingly, we find that for vacuum-evaporated MAPbI(3) and K+-doped (MA,FA,Cs)Pb(I/Br)(3), the line mu(F)/e values are close to the reported V-oc values. This implies that for an improvement of the V-oc charge carrier recombination within the bare perovskite has to be reduced. On the other hand, for MHPs with Cs+ and/or Rb+ addition, the experimental V-oc is still below mu(F)/e, suggesting that higher voltages are feasible by optimizing the transport layers.

In this contribution, we take advantage of long carrier lifetimes and carrier diffusion lengths in perovskite thin films, their high absorption cross-sections throughout the visible spectrum, and the strong spin-orbit coupling owing to the abundance of heavy atoms to sensitize the upconverter rubrene. Employing bulk perovskite thin films as the absorber layer and spin-mixer in inorganic/organic heterojunction upconversion devices allows us to forego the passivating ligands required for colloidal sensitizers, which can hinder exciton transport through large scale arrays and reduce the triplet transfer efficiency to the annihilator.

The matched band alignment between perovskites and Nb2O5 promotes electron injection at the ETL/perovskite interface, and decreases the energy barrier for electron injection.

PA chain length is shown to control the PQD size (ca. 2.9-4.2 nm) and excitonic absorption band positions (lambda=488-525 nm), with shorter chain lengths corresponding to smaller sizes and bluer absorptions. All samples show a high PL quantum yield (ca. 46-83 %) and high PL stability; this is indicative of a low density of band gap trap states and effective surface passivation.

The variation of J(sc) and V-oc with the grain size (g) of three different solar cells with CdTe, CZTS and perovskite absorber layers are modelled and fitted with the experimental dataset collected from relevant literature. The experimental literature suggested that the grain size of absorber layers in solar cells is controlled during the deposition process by adjusting the growth rate, temperature and ambient. The model has been successfully applied to the experimental data obtained from CdTe, CZTS and MAPbI(3) Perovskite solar cells by adjusting a few parameters which are affected by grain size such as mobility, diffusion length, and carrier lifetime. A bigger grain size leads to a higher short-circuit current density and open circuit voltage. However, the polycrystalline nature of thin film materials is still an impediment for the fabrication of large grain absorber layers compared to single crystalline Si materials. The modeling results show almost similar trends of dependency of device parameters on grain size: both J(sc) and V-oc follow the root g trend (g(1/2)) and for larger grain sizes it tends to a constant level. CZTS and perovskite cells show an almost polynomial quadratic dependency on grain size. The grain size of 2 mu m seems to be a turning point for the CdTe materials, 1.5 mu m for CZTS and 250 nm for perovskites.

In this work, we investigated the impact of the coexistence of PbI2 and CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite on photoluminescence (PL) properties. In absorbance and PL measurements performed at room temperature, we observed an emission peak at 780 nm, which is consistent with the band-edge absorption of CH3NH3PbI3. On the top surface, we observed dissolved PbI2, which could serve as a passivation species for improving PL stability upon exposure to ambient conditions. Specifically, dual-peak PL spectra were observed at room temperature. The peak at 780 nm originates from the free-carrier transition of CH3NH3PbI3 and the peak at 796 nm originates from the PbI2-related recombination. Based on time-resolved PL and X-ray diffraction measurements, we can conclude that unconverted and dissolved PbI2 in CH3NH3PbI3 forms a type-II band alignment at the CH3NH3PbI3/PbI2 interface. This type II hetero-structure indeed influences the quality and PL performance of perovskites. To check this structure or quality of perovskite, x-ray diffraction (XRD) and x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) are common ways. Here, we demonstrated a cheaper, faster and more convenience method, PL measurement, to check the quality of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films. It should be a useful way to check the quality perovskite-based LEDs and solar cells merely by observing whether the dual peaks exist or not in the PL spectra.

Here, we present a new class of HTM with pyridine as a central core with an extended pi-conjugated molecular structure with electron-donating blocks. We have systematically investigated its photophysical, thermal, electrochemical, and charge transport properties and found that 4,4'-(5,5'-(pyridine-2,6-diylbis(4,1-phenylene))bis(thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis (N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline) (PyThTPA) is a potential HTM candidate for making PSCs. The PyThTPA HTM-based PSC attained an average PCE of 16.57% with outstanding long-term durability of over 720 hrs with minimal reduction of its initial PCE and negligible hysteresis. This PSC performance was 34% higher than that of the state-of-the-art HTM, Spiro-OMeTAD with tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (BCF). We speculate that the Lewis acid-base adduct (LABA) formation of pyridine in the HTM and BCF interacted with methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)), resulting in the MAPbI(3)/HTM interface becoming more selective for holes.

Here, we systematically investigate the influence of Rb+ and Cs+ on the carrier dynamics using transient optical spectroscopy and correlate with solar cell performance. Unlike Rb+, Cs+ integrates well with methylammonium (MA(+)) and formamidinium (FA(+)) yielding increased perovskite grain size, longer charge carrier lifetimes and improved power conversion efficiency (PCE). Concomitant incorporation of Cs+/Rb+ cooperatively retards radiative recombination by similar to 60% in the quaternary-cation based perovskite system (RbCsMAFA) compared to the dualcation MAFA samples. By suppressing the defect density, PCEs around 20% are obtained along with more balanced charge carrier diffusion length and comparable photoluminescence quantum yield in quaternary-cation perovskites. While the synergistic addition of Rb+ and Cs+ is attractive for controlling defects and recombination losses in efficient solar cells development, sole incorporation of Rb+ is still an engineering challenge.

Herein, we introduce an additive engineering strategy employing quaternary ammonium salts, namely benzyltrimethylammonium bromide (BTABr), phenyltrimethylammonium bromide (PTABr) and benzyltrimethylammonium chloride (BTACl), in the precursor solution to prepare uniform and dense MAPbBr(3) perovskite films with reduced grain sizes. These quaternary ammonium salts, which have cations containing a bulky benzyl unit, are more effective at reducing the grain sizes of MAPbBr(3) perovskites. More importantly, the BTABr additive performs a dual-passivation effect to the MAPbBr(3), effectively reducing the trap density within the perovskite layer as well as the proportion of non-radiative recombination of PeLEDs, and balancing the charge injection. Consequently, PeLEDs incorporating a BTABr-modified MAPbBr(3) layer exhibit a reduced turn-on voltage from 4.2 to 2.6 V, and the maximum luminance and current efficiency are enhanced from 3490 Cd/m(2) and 0.24 Cd/A of the reference device to 12026 Cd/m(2) and 1.27 Cd/A, respectively.",,,,"Wang, Tao/G-6241-2011","Wang, Tao/0000-0002-5887-534X",,,,,,,,,,,,1566-1199,1878-5530,,,,APR,2019,67,,,,,,187,193,,10.1016/j.orgel.2019.01.030,,,,,,,,WOS:000458495700027,,,,,

In this work, we describe a facile and cost-effective method to improve the morphology of an all-inorganic-perovskite emissive layer by using a dual-additive blending strategy. A polar polymer, polyethylene oxide (PEO), and an n-type small molecule, TPBi, are blended with CsPbBr3 to provide synchronous effect in passivizing the surface defects and reducing the exciton quenching, as evidenced by the formation of smaller uniform grains and improved radiative recombination lifetime.

Although a number of efforts have been made to reproduce flat, uniform, and dense perovskite films using a stoichiometric ratio of 'CH(3)NH(3)l: PbI2: DMSO = 1:1:1', several complicated processes are required to achieve a regular grain-to-grain uniformity. Therefore, it was difficult to reproduce. This is because the conventional ratio of 'CH3NH3I: PbI2: DMSO = 1:1:1' can cause the CH3NH3I-PbI2-DMSO intermediate phase and the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal phase to coexist in solution. As a result, the CH3NH3PbI3 crystals in the solution may deteriorate the quality of the thin film. In this study, the non-stoichiometric molar ratio among CH3NH3I:PbI2:DMSO solutions was applied to control the quality of the perovskite layers. We successfully fabricated uniform and dense CH3NH3PbI3 PSCs, by simply manipulating CH3NH3PbI3 solubility with the different DMSO molar amounts. Further, a homogeneous grain size and a regular inter-grain arrangement with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were obtained in the optimized solubility. We also confirmed that the PSCs with the optimized condition exhibited higher J(sc) (Current density) and PCE (Power Conversion Efficiency), due to the Lamer model effect on the enhancement of the internal light absorption. Furthermore, the device with the optimized solubility exhibited enhanced electrical properties. Especially, the improved-electrical properties of the charge carrier-separation, mobility, collection, generation, and resistances were confirmed by photoluminescence (PL) quenching/mapping of the space-charge limited current (SCLC), the photo current density as a function of internal voltage (J(ph)-V-int) characteristic, and the impedance. Consequently, it was shown that tailoring the solubility of CH3NH3PbI3 can have a critical effect on the production of high quality perovskite thin films. These films will have an appropriate particle size and uniformity that will have a promising approach for generating high current densities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0927-0248,1879-3398,,,,APR,2019,192,,,,,,24,35,,10.1016/j.solmat.2018.12.010,,,,,,,,WOS:000458094200004,,,,,

Further enhancement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of this technology is expected from improved light management. In this simulation-based study, nanophotonic perovskite absorber layers are designed in order to enhance the short-circuit current density (J(SC)) of perovskite solar cells. The enhancement in J(SC) is beneficial in one of two ways. Firstly, optimized nanophotonic perovskite layers lead to an enhancement in J(SC) by 5-6% assuming a constant perovskite absorber volume, which correlates to a similar improvement in PCE and annual energy yield (EY). Secondly, optimized nanophotonic perovskite layers can alternatively allow a high J(SC) to be maintained at reduced perovskite absorber volumes. The latter approach results in about one third of the harmful lead content being mitigated in conventional perovskite solar cells, for an initial perovskite layer thickness of similar to 300 nm. This study evaluates and analyzes in detail the design of nanophotonic perovskite layers that can be fabricated by nanoimprint lithography. Various design parameters of the nanophotonic perovskite layers such as the period (150-750 nm), the geometrical filling fraction (0.2-0.6) and the depth (0-500 nm) of the nanostructures are studied.

The porphyrin-based HTMs with more bulky donor groups (SGT-062 and SGT-063) possess the larger dihedral angle between alkoxy-substituted phenyl ring and the donor TAA core, leading to the greater interference for the dense molecular arrangement and reducing the pi-pi stacking of HTM molecules. But SGT-061 with a less bulky donor enables a tight molecular arrangement to increase the pi-pi stacking between molecules.

Moreover, the dynamic charge transfer process of perovskite/various HTM films was studied by time-resolved photoluminescence decay.

The mechanical, thermodynamic and structural stabilities of the studied perovskites are revealed in terms of Born mechanical stability criteria, enthalpy of formation and Goldschmidt's tolerance factor, respectively. The ductile/brittle nature, anisotropy, wave velocity and Debye temperatures are computed to illustrate the mechanical nature. The optical parameters have been found highly sensitive to the exhibited band gap lying within visible energy. The large thermoelectric efficiency has been found that is responsible to exhibit optimum values of the power factors and the thermal conductivity. Furthermore, the specific heat capacity, Hall coefficient, magnetic susceptibility and electron density are also described in detail. Hence, the studied perovskites showing band gap in visible region have been found suitable for commercial applications in Solar cell, optoelectronic and thermoelectric devices.",,,,"laref, amel/F-7712-2018","laref, amel/0000-0002-8334-5180",,,,,,,,,,,,2053-1591,,,,,APR,2019,6,4,,,,,,,45901,10.1088/2053-1591/aaf997,,,,,,,,WOS:000455870700001,,,,,
J,"Devi, C; Mehra, R",,,,"Devi, Chandni; Mehra, Rajesh",,,Device simulation of lead-free MASnI(3) solar cell with CuSbS2 (copper antimony sulfide),JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,"The perovskite solar cells (PSCs) which are Pb free have gained much research enthusiasm because of the toxic nature of the lead-based halide perovskite. MASnI(3) is a feasible contrasting option to MAPbX(3), in light of the fact that it has broader visible absorption spectrum range and smaller band gap value of 1.3eV than MAPbI(3). The advance of fabricating Sn-based PSCs with great strength has animated the investigations of these MASnI(3)-based solar cells enormously. In this paper, planar heterojunction design of Sn-based iodide PSC is proposed. The copper antimony sulfide (CuSbS2) which is inorganic material is used for the very first time as hole transport layer (HTL) in conjunction with the MASnI(3) active layer in this design because of its inherent features (high abundance and high open-circuit voltage) as compared to the unstable and costly Spiro-MeOTAD. With integration of CuSbS2 as a HTL in the design, the outcomes are competent enough with J(sc) of 31.7mA/cm(2), V-oc of 0.936V, FF of 81.1% and PCE of 24.1%. The outcomes demonstrate that the Pb-free MASnI(3) PSC is a future perspective to the photovoltaic community in terms of environment friendly nature and yielding comparative high efficiency as of lead-based halide perovskite cell.",,,,,"Mehra, Rajesh/0000-0002-8014-4922",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-2461,1573-4803,,,,APR,2019,54,7,,,,,5615,5624,,10.1007/s10853-018-03265-y,,,,,,,,WOS:000455544800033,,,,,

However, the critical role of charge carrier behaviors and their quenching pathway in determining the overall photo catalytic performance are still not fully explored, which severely hindered the development for efficient photocatalysts. Herein, to further explore the essential principles of photocatalysis with heterostructures, a representative nano-regional photocatalytic heterostructure was constructed through uniform decoration of visible light activable BiOI nanodots on TiO2 nanorod assembled microflowers. With which as a well-known prototype of conventional heterostructures, a possible photocatalytic performance annihilation channel via reaction site self-quenching effect in photocatalytic heterostructures was experimentally evidenced for the first time. Based on our experimental results, we evidenced that excessive decoration with BiOI nanodots would result in severe self-quenching of their photocatalytic sites through highly probable charge carrier recombination between migrating electrons along TiO2 nanorods and reactive holes in adjacent BiOI nanodots. Such fundamental and experimental discovery is not limited to the current model and would shed light on the development of novel nano-regional heterostructures with high photocatalysis performance.",,,,"Liu, Yu/A-3789-2011","Liu, Yu/0000-0002-9702-349X; Liang, Liangliang/0000-0003-4958-3801",,,,,,,,,,,,0926-3373,1873-3883,,,,APR,2019,243,,,,,,220,228,,10.1016/j.apcatb.2018.10.045,,,,,,,,WOS:000453616800023,,,,,

Herein, we demonstrate the fabrication of an assembly of horizontally aligned TiO2 nanorods (HATNRs) on FTO substrates via a facile hydrothermal route. The HATNRs are employed as the ETL to achieve 15.03% power conversion efficiency (PCE) in HPSCs which is higher than the PCE of compact TiO2 based devices (10.12%) by a factor of nearly 1.5. A mixed halide, mixed cation organometal perovskite FA(0.83)MA(0.17)Pb(Br0.17I0.83)(3) with optimized composition is used as the active layer. The excellent refractive index matching between the perovskite and TiO2, coupled with strong Mie scattering in the nanorod geometry results in broadband near-zero backscattering and high forward scattering, upon coating of HATNRs with perovskite. The maximum suppression of backscattering is found at similar to 600 nm. The HATNRs ETL also improves the extraction of electrons from the perovskite layer and results in superior blocking of carrier recombination at the perovskite layer/FTO interface.",,,,"Kumar, Pawan/L-1750-2016; Thakur, Ujwal Kumar/K-1665-2019","Kumar, Pawan/0000-0003-2804-9298; Thakur, Ujwal Kumar/0000-0003-0076-1451",,,,,,,,,,,,0378-7753,1873-2755,,,,31-Mar,2019,417,,,,,,176,187,,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.11.089,,,,,,,,WOS:000461408300020,,,,,
