The electron density distribution of the 6p orbital was delocalized on an iodine atom at the highest occupied molecular orbital, and that of the 3d orbital was localized on a Mn atom at the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital. The absorption properties in the near-infrared region originated from the first excitation process of ligand-metal charge transfer (LMCT).

The incorporation of this dicationic salt significantly increases the hole conductivity of X60 by two orders of magnitude from 10(-6) to 10(-4) S cm(-1). The dramatic enhancement of the conductivity leads to an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.0% measured at 1 sun illumination (100 mW cm(-2), AM 1.5 G), which is comparable to that of the device doped with LiTFSI (19.3%) under an identical condition. More strikingly, by replacing LiTFSI, the PSC devices incorporating X60(TFSI)(2) also show an excellent long-term durability under ambient atmosphere for 30 days, mainly due to the hydrophobic nature of the X60(TFSI)(2) doped HTM layer, which can effectively prevent the moisture destroying the perovskite layer.

In particular, inorganic and hybrid perovskite materials undergo structural phase transitions associated with octahedral tilts of the metal-halide octahedra. We investigate the structural instabilities present in inorganic CsMX3 perovskites with Pb or Sn on the metal site and Br or I on the X site. Defining primary order parameters in terms of symmetry-adapted collective displacement modes and secondary order parameters in terms of symmetrized Hencky strain components, we unravel the coupling between octahedral tilt modes and macroscopic strains as well as the role of A-site displacements in perovskite phase stability. Symmetry-allowed secondary strain order parameters are enumerated for the 14 unique perovskite tilt systems. Using first-principles calculations to explore the Born-Oppenheimer energy surface in terms of symmetrized order parameters, we find coupling between octahedral tilting and A-site displacements is necessary to stabilize Pnma ground states.

The use of NiOx as a HTL for ""inverted"" PSC as part of a monolithic silicon/perovskite tandem solar cell is also suitable when the processing temperature is suitably low. Solution-processed NiOx at low temperature for PSCs remains to be improved due to the relatively low short-circuit current density (J(sc)) and fill factor (FF) of reported devices. In this work, the use of Ag-doping is reported for solution-processed NiOx film at 300 degrees C for inverted planar PSCs. We have shown that Ag-doping has no negative effect on the optical transmittance and morphology of the NiOx film and the overlying perovskite film. In addition, Ag-doping is effective in improving conductivity, improving carrier extraction, and enhancing the p-type property of the NiOx film confirmed by electrical characterization, photoluminescence measurements, and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. These improvements result in better devices based on the ITO/Ag:NiOx/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM/BCP/Ag structure with improved average FF (from 69% to 75%), enhanced average J(SC) (by 1.2 mA/cm(2) absolute) and enhanced average V-OC (by 29 mV absolute).

This is most often the case with thin film technologies, including perovskite cells, where the active layers are a few microns thick and can be sensitive to moisture, liquid water or both. When moisture or liquid water can ingress, a small amount of water can lead to corrosion and depending on the resulting reactions, a larger local detrimental effect is possible. To prevent moisture from contacting photovoltaic components, impermeable frontsheets and backsheets are used with a polyisobutylene (PIB)-based edge seal material around the perimeter. Here, we evaluate the ability of a PIB-based edge seal using a molecular sieve desiccant to keep moisture out for the expected module lifetime. Moisture ingress is evaluated using test coupons where the edge seal is placed between 2 pieces of glass, one of which has a metallic calcium film on it, and monitoring the moisture ingress distance as a function of time. We expose samples to different temperature and humidity conditions to create permeation models useful for extrapolation to field use. This extrapolation indicates that this PIB material is capable of keeping moisture out of a module for the desired lifetime.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1062-7995,1099-159X,,,,FEB,2018,26,2,,,,,93,101,,10.1002/pip.2947,,,,,,,,WOS:000419970700001,,,,,

In this paper, we investigate theoretically the effect of ferroelectricity on the redistribution of charge in a PCBM/perovskite device through the Poisson equation. The spontaneous polarization is set to be a hyperbolic tangent function of applied electrical field. The carriers in both the layers are assumed to be in quasi-equilibrium, and the (dark) current stems from the recombination at the PCBM/perovskite interface. The electrostatic potential profiles throughout the device and the current-bias (I - V) curves are obtained numerically. It is found that for the bias forward scan, larger potential drop will be on the PCBM layer, and for the bias reverse scan larger potential drop will be on the perovskite layer.

It is demonstrated that CsPbI2Br does not irreversibly degrade to its component salts as in the case of methyl ammonium lead iodide but instead is induced (by water vapor) to transform from its metastable brown cubic (1.92 eV band gap) phase to a yellow phase having a higher band gap (2.85 eV). This is easily reversed by heating to 350 degrees C in a dry environment. Similarly, exposure of unencapsulated photovoltaic devices to water vapor causes current (J(SC)) loss as the absorber transforms to its more transparent (yellow) form, but this is also reversible by moderate heating, with over 100% recovery of the original device performance. NMR and thermal analysis show that the high band gap yellow phase does not contain detectable levels of water, implying that water induces the transformation but is not incorporated as a major component. Performances of devices with best efficiencies of 9.08% (V-OC = 1.05 V, J(SC) = 12.7 mA cm(-2) and FF = 68.4%) using a device structure comprising glass/ITO/c-TiO2/CsPbI2Br/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au are presented, and further results demonstrating the dependence of the performance on the preparation temperature of the solution processed CsPbI2Br films are shown.

To eliminate these problems, Nafion, the hydrophobic perfluorosulfonic copolymer, is incorporated into PEDOT:PSS by a simple spin-coating process.

Nevertheless, mismatch of PCE due to current density (J)-voltage (V) hysteresis in perovskite solar cells is an obstacle to overcome. There has been much lively debate on the origin of J-V hysteresis; however, effective methodology to solve the hysteric problem has not been developed. Here we report a universal approach for hysteresis-free perovskite solar cells via defect engineering. A severe hysteresis observed from the normal mesoscopic structure employing TiO2 and spiro-MeOTAD is almost removed or does not exist upon doping the pure perovskites, CH3NH3PbI3 and HC(NH2)(2)PbI3, and the mixed cation/anion perovskites, FA(0.85)MA(0.15)PbI(2.55)Br(0.45) and FA(0.85)MA(0.1)Cs(0.05)PbI(2.7)Br(0.3), with potassium iodide. Substantial reductions in low-frequency capacitance and bulk trap density are measured from the KI-doped perovskite, which is indicative of trap-hysteresis correlation. A series of experiments with alkali metal iodides of LiI, NaI, KI, RbI and CsI reveals that potassium ion is the right element for hysteresis-free perovskite. Theoretical studies suggest that the atomistic origin of the hysteresis of perovskite solar cells is not the migration of iodide vacancy but results from the formation of iodide Frenkel defect. Potassium ion is able to prevent the formation of Frenkel defect since K+ energetically prefers the interstitial site. A complete removal of hysteresis is more pronounced at mixed perovskite system as compared to pure perovskites, which is explained by lower formation energy of K interstitial (-0.65 V for CH3NH3PbI3 vs -1.17 V for mixed perovskite). The developed KI doping methodology is universally adapted for hysteresis-free perovskite regardless of perovskite composition and device structure.",,,,"Shin, Hyunjung/D-5107-2009; Park, Nam-Gyu/F-2477-2014; Son, Dae-Yong/B-6555-2019","Shin, Hyunjung/0000-0003-1284-9098; ",,,,,,,,,,,,0002-7863,,,,,31-Jan,2018,140,4,,,,,1358,1364,,10.1021/jacs.7b10430,,,,,,,,WOS:000424313000031,29300468,,,,

Devices fabricated using different hole-transporting materials infiltrated into carbon nanotube networks were examined for their performance and stability under constant illumination in air. Polymeric hole-transporting layers show much higher stability when combined with carbon nanotubes due to their compact nature and stronger interaction with the carbon network. As a result, the encapsulated device showed high stability both in air and under light illumination, maintaining up to 80% of the initial efficiency after 2200 hours under actual operation conditions.

This UV instability can be solved by replacing TiO2 with SnO2; thus developing a mesoporous SnO2 (m-SnO2) perovskite solar cell is a promising approach to maximise efficiency and stability.

We found that gallium doping severely decreases the trap state density in SnO2, leading to a lower recombination rate. This, in turn, leads to an increased open circuit potential and fill factor, yielding a stabilised power conversion efficiency of 16.4%.

Inclusion of methylammonium chloride into the precursor solutions suppresses the formation of the undesired zero dimensional dimer phase and leads to the successful synthesis of high-quality perovskite films composed of the two-dimensional layered phase favored for photovoltaics. Solar cells based on the as-obtained (CH3NH3)(3)Sb2ClXI9-X films reach a record-high power conversion efficiency over 2%. This finding offers a new perspective for the development of nontoxic and low-cost Sb-based perovskite solar cells.",,,,"Zhang, Lijun/F-7710-2011; Zhou, Yinhua/G-5306-2010","Zhou, Yinhua/0000-0001-6424-9962; Han, Hongwei/0000-0002-5259-7027; Zhang, Lijun/0000-0002-6438-5486",,,,,,,,,,,,0002-7863,,,,,24-Jan,2018,140,3,,,,,1019,1027,,10.1021/jacs.7b10739,,,,,,,,WOS:000423496700029,29275630,,,,

The deposition of perovskite thin films is usually carried out by solution-based processes using spincoating techniques that result in the production of high quality films. Solar cells made by this method exceed 20% efficiency, with the potential for use in large scale production through ink print or screen printing techniques. As an alternative route, perovskite thin films can be deposited through thermal evaporation. A new method is proposed to produce CH3NH3PbI3, based on a radio-frequency (rf) -sputtering technique that results in a high reproducibility of the films and is compatible with roll-toroll processes. We deposited thin films of lead-sulphide (PbS) and converted them into perovskite by placing the films in an iodine atmosphere, followed by dipping in a solution of methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I).

However, its share in the photovoltaics market at present is tiny, since the most efficient tandem device comprises III-V semiconductors, which entail the use of expensive fabrication processes. The advent of perovskite solar cells, which have revitalized the PV field with their unprecedented pace of development, promises to address this bottleneck. Perovskite materials could not only serve as the top subcell absorber for commercial solar cells including Si and copper indium gallium selenide, but could work efficiently as bottom subcells owing to highly tuneable bandgaps which extend down to the range of similar to 1.2 to 1.5 eV. The highest-efficiency perovskite tandem to date was achieved by pairing a perovskite top cell with a Si bottom cell in a four-terminal configuration, yielding 26.4%. This review gives an overview of recent progress on the main tandem structures, and describes the detailed design improvements that have resulted in new record efficiencies. Ultimately, commercialization of these tandem solar cells relies on the scalability of perovskite technology. We, therefore, highlight the development of large-scale tandems and approaches to produce perovskite modules. We also point out the critical aspects that will require further effort and provide guidelines for future developments. The potential obstacles that will hamper the commercialization of perovskite tandems, if not adequately addressed, namely device stability and toxicity, are then critically examined.

The electronic band structures of both CsPbI3 slabs and the BP monolayer are preserved in the combined vdW CsPbI3-BP heterostructures. The heterostructure of the Pb-I interface contacting with BP demonstrates the type-I band alignment, and the Cs-I interface contacting with the BP heterostructure demonstrates the type-II band alignment. The reason for the energy level shift is the work function difference of CsPbI3 slabs relative to the BP monolayer, which drives electrons and holes to move spontaneously. In addition, the CsPbI3-BP heterostructures show much better optical properties than CsPbI3 slabs.

Lasing with both engineered and self-assembled resonator structures, such as microcrystal networks, has now been successfully observed, with the low cost and the simple solution-based process being a particular attraction.

Our lasers work at room temperature; they are deposited on unpatterned glass substrates and they exhibit a minimum threshold value of 10 mu J/cm(2). By carefully controlling the solution processing conditions, we can determine whether random lasing occurs or not, using identical precursors. A rather special feature is that some of the films exhibit single and dual mode lasing action, which is rarely observed in random lasers.

A conventional PSC device structure typically employs a titanium dioxide (TiO2) electron transport layer. However, the low electrical conductivity of TiO2 is an obstacle to PSC efficiency enhancement. In this paper, we report on the conductivity enhancement of TiO2 by tantalum (Ta) doping and its effect on improving the device performance. In contrast to commonly used mesoporous TiO2, our work used a planar PSC device structure based on a compact TiO2 layer with the device structure being: FTO/compact-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/P3HT/Ag. Photovoltaic measurements show that Ta doping of compact TiO2 results in an improvement in the fill factor (FF) of the devices due to a decrease in the series resistance (R-s), attributed to improved charge transport and an increase in the shunt resistance (R-sh), due to reduced leakage paths. These changes were examined using Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) which indicated that the Fermi level of TiO2 shifts downward upon Ta doping providing driving force for the electron transfer from the perovskite LUMO to the TiO2 conduction band resulting in higher current density. Furthermore, impedance spectroscopy analysis of the devices suggests a decrease in the charge transfer resistance with Ta-doping and an increase in R-sh due to the higher recombination resistance of doped films. PSC devices with Ta doping of 3.0% led to a 40% improvement in the overall efficiency as compared to un-doped TiO2 with the best device showing a power conversion efficiency of ca. 9.94%.",,,,,"Gupta, Raju/0000-0002-5537-8057",,,,,,,,,,,,2050-7488,2050-7496,,,,21-Jan,2018,6,3,,,,,1037,1047,,10.1039/c7ta09193a,,,,,,,,WOS:000422949700034,,,,,

However, the rapid decomposition of these materials in humid environments hinders outdoor application, and thus, a comprehensive understanding of the degradation mechanism is required. We investigate the effect of water intercalation and hydration of the decomposition and ion migration of CH3NH3PbX3 using first-principles calculations. We find that water interacts with PbX6 and MA through hydrogen bonding, and the former interaction increases gradually, while the latter hardly changes when going from X = I to Br and to Cl. Thermodynamic calculations indicate that water exothermically intercalates into the perovskite, and suggest that the water intercalated and monohydrated compounds are stable with respect to decomposition. More importantly, the water intercalation reduces the activation energies for vacancy-mediated ion migration, which become higher going from X = I to Br and to Cl.

However, what is followed is commercialization and industrialization process, which will greatly enhance the importance and urgency of the research and development of the green, non-toxic, highly-efficient, and lead-free perovskite solar cells. In order to speed up the development of these environment-friendly perovskite solar cells, we summarize the recent research progress in the perovskite solar cells from the two categories of Pb-free and less-Pb materials. In the Pb-free aspect Sn-based perovskite solar cells are emphatically introduced. A maximum efficiency of 8.12% is obtained for the solar cells based on FA(0.75)MA(0.25)SnI(3), but it lags far behind the Pb-based competitors. This may be caused mainly by the oxidation of Sn2+ ions and the band mismatch with carrier transport materials, etc. So, for further improving the efficiency, it is very important to optimize the device structure and material properties, and understand the role played by Sn4+ ions in films. In addition, more attention should be paid to the inorganic halide double perovskite materials as potential solutions for the toxicity and stability issues. In the less-Pb part, Sn-doping contributes to a large reduction of lead content in the film, and a maximum efficiency of 17.6% for the (FASnI(3))(0.6)(MAPbI(3))(0.4) perovskite solar cells is achieved with good long-term stability. What is even more interesting is that it can be utilized to construct tandem cells through the bandgap regulation after doping. However, it is very difficult to determine the optimum Sn-doping ratio. More systematic, rigorous and normative experiments are extremely necessary to reveal the interaction mechanism between Pb2+ and Sn2+. For other doped elements, the effects of their concentrations on the properties of thin films and the performance of solar cells are also emphatically discussed, and it is very urgent to have a further understanding of the working principles of devices and the fundamental functions of substitution elements. Thus, this review highlights the recent research efforts in the development of Pb-free and less-Pb perovskite solar cells and also provides a perspective of future development of new environment-friendly and high performance perovskite solar cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1000-3290,,,,,20-Jan,2018,67,2,,,,,,,28801,10.7498/aps.67.20171956,,,,,,,,WOS:000425271700034,,,,,

The concentrations of the three polymer solutions have been optimized. The effect of interfacial modification by different polymer solutions on the photoelectric properties of perovskite layer and the performance of PSCs has been systematically investigated. The microstructure and photoelectric properties of the modified perovskite films has been systematically studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), conducting force microscopy (CFM) and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). The results reveal that the modified perovskite films with tetrahedral perovskite structure have lager grain size, lower roughness and better photoelectric properties compared with the reference sample.

In fact, comparison of the time when the device performance has degraded to 80% of its initial value (T-80 lifetime) of numerous solar cells throughout the literature reveals a strongly reduced stability under illumination. Herein, the various detrimental effects are discussed. Most notably, moisture-and heat-related degradation can be mitigated easily by now. Recently, however, several photoinduced degradation mechanisms have been observed. Under illumination, mixed perovskites tend to phase segregate, while, further, oxygen catalyzes deprotonation of the organic cations. Additionally, during illumination photo-generated charge can be trapped in the N-H antibonding orbitals causing dissociation of the organic cation. On the other hand, organic-inorganic perovskites exhibit a high radiation hardness that is superior to crystalline silicon.

To achieve a high PCE and long lifetime simultaneously, an insulating polymer interface layer is deposited on top of TiO2. Three polymers, each with a different functional group (hydroxyl, amino, or aromatic group), are investigated to further understand the relation of interface structure and device PCE as well as stability. We show that it is necessary to consider not only the band alignment at the interface, but also interface chemical interactions between the thin interface layer and the perovskite film. The hydroxyl and amino groups interact with CH3NH3PbI3 leading to poor PCEs. In contrast, deposition of a thin layer of polymer consisting of an aromatic group to prevent the direct contact of TiO2 and CH3NH3PbI3 can significantly enhance the device stability, while the same time maintaining a high PCE. The fact that a polymer interface layer on top of TiO2 can enhance device stability, strongly suggests that the interface interaction between TiO2 and CH3NH3PbI3 plays a crucial role. Our work highlights the importance of interface structure and paves the way for further optimization of PCEs and stability of perovskite solar cells.",,,,"Wang, Shenghao/I-4200-2019; Wang, Shenghao/F-4243-2015; Qi, Yabing/O-7807-2014","Wang, Shenghao/0000-0002-8216-1099; Wang, Shenghao/0000-0002-8216-1099; Qi, Yabing/0000-0002-4876-8049",,,,,,,,,,,,1520-6106,,,,,18-Jan,2018,122,2,,,SI,,511,520,,10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b03921,,,,,,,,WOS:000423140600013,28514169,,,,

This long PL decay is non-exponential, suggesting the presence of a distribution of carrier relaxation times. Spectro-temporal studies show that the emission peak red-shifts with increasing time. The physics of this problem is closely related to donor-acceptor pair recombination in crystalline semiconductors and recombination in a-Si:H. Based on these models, we present a simple model to account for the recombination dynamics in the perovskite systems. This model also accounts for the fluence dependence of the recombination kinetics. In this model, a fraction of the photogenerated electrons and holes are trapped in localized states. The electrons tunnel to the hole sites for recombination. The broad distribution of lifetimes is a consequence of the fact that the tunneling probability is very sensitive to the separation of electron-hole pairs, and PL decay dynamics is a function of excitation fluence, i.e., carrier density generated by optical excitation.

In this work, the formation energies and transition energy levels of intrinsic point defects in gamma- (more stable than alpha-phase) and delta-phases have been studied systematically by first-principles calculations. It is found that CsPbI3 exhibits a unipolar self-doping behavior (p-type conductivity), which is in contrast to CH3NH3PbI3. Most of the intrinsic defects induce deeper transition energy levels in delta-phase than in y-phase. This is due to the small Pb-I-Pb bond angles in delta-phase that results in the weak antibonding character of valence band maximum (VBM). However, the strong antibonding character of VBM plays a critical role in keeping defect tolerance in semiconductors.

Here, a surface modification process is developed to optimize the surface layer morphology of PbI2 precursor films and lower the resistance of the induced period in crystallization. The vapor optimization time is shortened to several seconds, and the intermediate phase forms on the surface layer of PbI2 films. We achieve porous PbI2 surface with smaller grains through dimethyl sulfoxide vapor treatment, which promotes the migration and reaction rate between CH3NH3I vapor and PbI2 layer. The PbI2 precursor films undergo dramatic morphological evolution due to the formed intermediate phase on PbI2 surface layer. Taking advantage of the proposed surface modification process, we achieve high-quality uniform perovskite films with larger crystal grains and without residual PbI2.

Lead halide perovskites have caused a paradigm shift in state-of-the-art photovoltaic technology half a decade ago and have gained tremendous momentum ever since. Given their seemingly imminent commercialization, rigorous scrutiny regarding their potential environmental impact is becoming increasingly relevant. In light of the current need for sustainable energy resources, several start-up and spin-off companies have been established, initially promising modules on the market by the end of 2017. On the downside, lead representing approximately one third by weight of the absorber layer in such photovoltaic devices is enough reason to become wary about the potential environmental impact of their large-scale implementation. Whilst many have wondered where the acceptable boundaries lie regarding lead consumption, it remains a focal point in many discussions, as it seems almost unattainable to ban lead usage from our society. Currently listed as one of the ten chemicals of major health concern by the World Health Organization, the magnitude of misgivings expands even more as recent studies also demonstrate promising applications of lead halide perovskites in light emitting diodes, lasers, batteries, and photodetectors. Hence, there is no doubt that a discussion should be commenced on how to assess and handle the impact of lead in a new technology of such high potential. By reflecting on the historical experience gained from anthropogenic lead poisoning that is still shaping our legislatorial systems at present-day, this work investigates and carefully scrutinizes current legislation that governs the exploitation of lead halide perovskites in optoelectronic applications. Analyzing the repetitive pattern of historical lead consumption, focus is extended on creating awareness and caution toward lead halide perovskite commercialization while concurrently pointing out considerations and ambiguity in policies and regulations.

It is found that the introduced SFX pendant groups in triphenylamine-based molecules show significant influence on the conductivity, energy levels, and thin-film surface morphology.

However, detailed theoretical research is still rare. This study presents a microscopic view to reveal the interaction mechanism between O-2 and perovskite based on the first-principles calculation. The results show that O-2 is adsorbed on the (100) surface of MAPbI(3) perovskite mainly by Van der Waals force. O-2 adsorption makes the MAPbI3 surface generate a small number of positive charges, which leads to the increase of the work function of the MAPbI(3) surface. This is in agreement with the experimental measurement. And increased work function of MAPbI(3) surface is not beneficial to electron transfer from perovskite to electronic extraction layer (such as TiO2). Comparison of the density of states (DOS) of the clean (100) surface and the adsorbed system shows that an in-gap state belonging to O-2 appears, which can explain the phenomenon observed from experiments that electron transfers from the surface of perovskite to O-2 to form superoxide. The theoretical power conversion efficiency of the system with and without O-2 adsorption is evaluated, and it turns out that the power conversion efficiency of the system with O-2 adsorption is slightly lower than that of the system without O-2 adsorption. This result indicates that avoiding the introduction of O2 molecules between perovskite and electronic extraction layer is beneficial to the perovskite solar cell. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Low-temperature solution-processed planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are desirable for achieving these aims. Although TiO2 is the most widely used material in preparing electron-transporting layers (ETLs) of PSCs, it usually requires a high-temperature sintering process to enhance electron mobility, which not only consumes considerable energy but is also unsuitable for polymer-based flexible substrates. Here, we propose a novel strategy involving the use of a sophisticated solvothermal method with the aid of oleic acid (OA) ligands to synthesize high aspect ratio and well crystallized TiO2 nanorods.

The photocurrent hysteresis phenomenon in C-ZnO PSCs is also substantially reduced due to mitigated charge trapping phenomena and concomitant reduction in an electrode polarization process. Another major highlight of this work is that, C-ZnO PSCs demonstrate a superior device stability retaining about 94% of its initial PCE in the course of a month-long, systematic degradation study conducted in our work.

However, it was found that several disadvantages could occur at the ZnO/perovskite interface, such as decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3 and poorly aligned energy levels. To overcome these issues, we present a design based on staircase band alignment of a low-temperature solution-processed ZnO/Al-doped ZnO (AZO) bilayer thin film as electron transport layers in planar perovskite solar cells. Experimental results revealed that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells was significantly increased from 12.3% to 16.1% by employing the AZO thin film as the buffer layer.

In this work, an efficient YCl3-treated TiO2 electron transfer layer (ETL) is used to fabricate perovskite solar cells with enhanced photovoltaic performance and less hysteresis. The YCl3-treated TiO2 layers bring about an upward shift of the conduction band minimum (E-CBM), which results in a better energy level alignment for photogenerated electron transfer and extraction from the perovskite into the TiO2 layer. After optimization, perovskite solar cells based on the YCl3-treated TiO2 layers achieve a maximum power conversion efficiency of about 19.99% (19.29% at forward scan) and a steady-state power output of about 19.6%. Steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements and impedance spectroscopy are carried out to investigate the charge transfer and recombination dynamics between the perovskite and the TiO2 electron transfer layer interface. The improved perovskite/TiO2 ETL interface with YCl3 treatment is found to separate and extract photogenerated charge rapidly and suppress recombination effectively, which leads to the improved performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1864-5631,1864-564X,,,,10-Jan,2018,11,1,,,,,171,177,,10.1002/cssc.201701911,,,,,,,,WOS:000419685900016,29210503,,,,

It is the smallest signal that can be measured from the device; hence, systematic characterization of the LFN properties can be utilized as a highly sensitive nondestructive tool for the characterization of material defects in the device. It has been demonstrated that the noise power spectral densities of the devices are critically dependent on the parameters of the fabrication process, including the growth ambient of the perovskite layer and the incorporation of the mesoscopic structures in the devices. Our experimental results indicated that the LFN arises from a thermally activated trapping and detrapping process, resulting in the corresponding fluctuations in the conductance of the device. The results show that the presence of oxygen in the growth ambient of the HCVD process and the inclusion of an mp-TiO2 layer in the device structure are two important factors contributing to the substantial reduction in the density of the localized states in the MAPI devices.

Three zinc-coordinated chlorophyll derivatives with bacteriochlorin, chlorin, and porphyrin macrocycles, namely, ZnBChl, ZnChl, and ZnPor, respectively, were newly synthesized and employed as HTMs in PSCs. The difference in the it backbones of these HTMs causes differences in their photophysical properties, and thus different hole-extraction abilities, as revealed by steady-state photoluminescence spectra. The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs with a typical mesoporous structure, fluorine-doped tin oxide/compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM/Ag, are 8.26%, 11.88%, and 0.68% for ZnBChl, ZnChl, and ZnPor, respectively. The small PCE of the ZnPor-based PSC is partially attributed to the small energy gap of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels between ZnPor and CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite. Therefore, we increased this energy gap slightly by shifting the HOMO level of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite downward by incorporating formamidinium and bromide ions into the crystal lattice of CH3NH3PbI3. As a result, the PCE of the ZnPor-based PSC improved to 4.04%, and it exhibited a clearly normal current-voltage curve, indicating better energy alignment between ZnPor and the modified perovskite. In addition, the barriers both in the perovskite/ZnPor interface and in the ZnPor layer originated from the delocalization of pi-electrons on the symmetric aggregates determine the low PCE of ZnPor-based PSCs; this was deduced from measurements of atomic force microscope, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, and the electric impedance spectroscopy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2574-0962,,,,,JAN,2018,1,1,,,,,9,16,,10.1021/acsaem.7b00018,,,,,,,,WOS:000458705000003,,,,,

To address this knowledge gap, we fabricated CH3NH3PbI3-based solar cells where either the methylammonium or iodide ions were replaced with 20 mol % of a dopant ion (ethylammonium, formamidinium, bromide, or chloride). We then assessed their stability either in a controlled 85% relative humidity environment or under 1 sun illumination in air; both conditions have been previously shown to rapidly decompose CH3NH3PbI3.

The analysis of transient absorption kinetics acquired at several distinct spatial positions enabled us to identify Auger recombination as the dominant mechanism underlying the initial portions of the spatially dependent dynamics with variable rate constants.

J,"Cui, QH; Bazar, GC",,,,"Cui, Qiuhong; Bazar, Guillermo C.",,,Narrow Band Gap Conjugated Polyelectrolytes,ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,"Two essential structural elements define a class of materials called conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs). The first is a polymer framework with an electronically delocalized, pi-conjugated structure. This component allows one to adjust desirable optical and electronic properties, for example the range of wavelengths absorbed, emission quantum yields, electron affinity, and ionization potential. The second-defining feature is the presence of ionic functionalities, which are usually linked via tethers that can modulate the distance of the charged groups relative to the backbone. These ionic groups render CPEs distinct relative to their neutral conjugated polymer counterparts. Solubility in polar solvents, including aqueous media, is an immediately obvious difference. This feature has enabled the development of optically amplified biosensor protocols and the fabrication of multilayer organic semiconductor devices through deposition techniques using solvents with orthogonal properties. Important but less obvious potential advantages must also be considered. For example, CPE layers have been used to introduce interfacial dipoles and thus modify the effective work function of adjacent electrodes. One can thereby modulate the barriers for charge injection into semiconductor layers and improve the device efficiencies of organic light-emitting diodes and solar cells. With a hydrophobic backbone and hydrophilic ionic sites, CPEs can also be used as dispersants for insoluble materials. Narrow band gap CPEs (NBGCPEs) have been studied only recently. They contain backbones that comprise electron-rich and electron-poor fragments, a combination that leads to intramolecular charge transfer excited states and enables facile oxidation and reduction. One particularly interesting combination is NBGCPEs with anionic sulfonate side groups, for which spontaneous self doping in aqueous media is observed. That no such doping is observed with cationic NBGCPEs indicates that the interplay between electrostatic forces and the redox chemistry of the organic semiconducting chain is essential for stabilizing the polaronic States and increasing the conductivity of the bulk. Capitalizing upon the properties of NBGCPEs has resulted in a range of new applications. When doped, they can be introduced as interlayers in organic and perovskite solar cells. Single-walled carbon nanotubes can be n- or p-doped with NBGCPEs, depending on whether the same backbone contains attached cationic or anionic side groups, respectively. The resulting dispersions can be used to fabricate flexible thermoelectric devices in which the n- and p-semiconductor legs are nearly identical in terms of chemical composition. Electrostatic interactions with negatively charged cell walls, in combination with the long-wavelength absorption and high photothermal efficiencies, have been used to create effective agents for photothermal killing of bacteria. Additionally, recent results have shown that cationic NBGCPEs can effectively n-dope graphene and that this doping is temperature-dependent. The preferential charge carriers can therefore be chosen to be electrons or holes depending on the applied temperature.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0001-4842,1520-4898,,,,JAN,2018,51,1,,,,,202,211,,10.1021/acs.accounts.7b00501,,,,,,,,WOS:000423252900022,29240395,,,,

It has been proven to be an effective way to modify halide perovskite materials' bandgap by replacing A or B ions with other equivalent ions. However, C ions have much fewer choices and are limited to halogen anions or pseudohalides anions. We designed a series of new cubic perovskite structures through substituting C anions by superhalogen clusters anions (BeX3-, MgX3-, BX4-, AlX4-, SiX5-, PX6-, X = F, Cl), and studied their structures and properties in first-principles way. Calculations were performed by using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) based on density functional theory. The DOS (Density of States) and bandgaps were calculated to analyze properties of the new perovskite structures. The results show that BeX3-, MgX3- (X = F, Cl) and SiCl5- could not remain its structure which means these three clusters are not superhalogen anions anymore after doping. The size and symmetry of superhalogen anions have influences on the structures of doped perovskites. The superhalogen anion whose symmetry is higher and size is closed to I-ion induces less distortions to doped perovskite structures. Comparing to the VBM (Valence Band Maximum) and CBM (Conduction Band Minimum) of CsPbI3, superhalogen anions substitutions could change the compositions of CBM and VBM and bandgaps. The bandgaps of superhalogen anions partial substitutions in halide perovskite become smaller compared to structures with superhalogen anions substituting completely. We demonstrate that the CsPb(PCl6)(3), with a direct-bandgap of 1.58 eV located at M(0,0.5,0.5) point, could be a potential candidate material for solar cells. Its CBM mainly is dominated by Cl 3p states, P 3s states and Pb 6p states. The other doped perovskites with wide bandgaps may have potential applications in transistors or memristors.

J,"Ouyang, JY",,,,Ouyang Jianyong,,,Recent Advances of Intrinsically Conductive Polymers,ACTA PHYSICO-CHIMICA SINICA,,,,,,,,,,,,"Intrinsically conductive polymers are a class of exciting materials since they combine the advantages of both metals and plastics. But their application is limited due to the issues related to their electronic properties, stability and processibility. For example, although polyacetylene can have electrical conductivity comparable to metals, it degrades fast in air. Most of the conductive polymers in the conductive state, such as polypyrrole and polythiophene, cannot be dispersed in any solvent and cannot be turned to a melt. It is thus difficult to process them into thin films with good quality, while thin films with good quality are important for many applications. In terms of the materials processing, polyaniline (PANi) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) have gained great attention. PANi doped with some large cations can be dispersed in some toxic organic solvents, and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) can be dispersed in water and some polar organic solvents. But the PANi and PEDOT:PSS films prepared from their solutions are usually low. Recently, great progress was made in improving the properties of intrinsically conductive polymers. The conductivity of PEDOT: PSS can be enhanced from 10(-1) S.cm(-1) to > 4000 S.cm(-1) through the so-called ""secondary doping"". The high conductivity together with the solution processibility enables the application of conductive polymers in many areas, such as electrodes and thermoelectric conversion. In addition, due to their electrochemical activity, conductive polymers or their composites with inorganic materials can have high capacity of charge storage. Conductive polymers can also be added into the electrodes of batteries, because they can facilitate the charge transport and alleviate the large volume change problem of silicon electrode of batteries. It has been demonstrated that conductive polymers can have important application in many areas, such as transparent electrode, stretchable electrode, neural interfaces, thermoelectric conversion and energy storage system.

In the typical PSC device architecture, hole transport materials that can effectively extract and transmit holes from the active layer to the counter electrode (HTMs) are indispensable. The well-known small molecule 2,2',7,7'-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxy-phenyl amino)-9,9'-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) is the best choice for optimal perovskite device performance. Nevertheless, there is a consensus that spiro-OMeTAD by itself is not stable enough for long-term use in devices due to the sophisticated oxidation process associated with undesired ion migration/interactions. It has been found that spiro-OMeTAD can significantly contribute to the overall cost of materials required for the PSC manufacturing, thus its market price makes its use in large-scale production costly. Besides, another main drawback of spiro-OMeTAD is its poor reproducibility. To engineer HTMs that are considerably cheaper and more reproducible than spiro-OMeTAD, shorter reaction schemes with simple purification procedures are required. Furthermore, HTMs must possess a number of other qualities, including excellent charge transporting properties, good energy matching with the perovskite, transparency to solar radiation, a large Stokes shift, good solubility in organic solvents, morphologically stable film formation, and others. To date, hundreds of new organic semiconductor molecules have been synthesized for use as HTMs in perovskite solar cells. Successful examples include azomethine derivatives, branched methoxydiphenylamine-substituted fluorine derivatives, enamine derivatives, and many others. Some of these have been incorporated as HTMs in complete, functional PSCs capable of matching the performance of the best-performing PSCs prepared using spiro-OMeTAD while showing even better stability. In light of these results, we describe the advances made in the synthesis of HTMs that have been tested in perovskite solar cells, and give an overview of the molecular engineering of HTMs. Meanwhile, we highlight the effects of molecular structure on PCE and device stability of PSCs. This review is organized as follows. In the first part, we give a general introduction to the development of PSCs. In the second part, we focus on the introduction of the perovskite structure, device architecture, and relevant work principles in detail. In the third part, we discuss all kinds of molecular HTMs applied in PSCs. Special emphasis is placed on the relationship between HTM molecular structure and device function.

Light absorption and energy band matching are the key points to enhance the solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency. Promoting the performance of a standalone semiconductor material and finding new materials, coupled with an optimized configuration, are future steps for the practical application of tandem PEC cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2374-6149,,,,,,2018,3,1,,,,,,,UNSP 1487267,10.1080/23746149.2018.1487267,,,,,,,,WOS:000444599400001,,,,,

Density-functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that Ag prefers to occupy the substitutional Ni site (Ag-Ni) and behaves as an acceptor in NiO lattice. Compared with the pristine NiOx films, appropriate Ag doping can increase the optical transparency, work function, electrical conductivity and hole mobility of NiOx films. Moreover, the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films grown on Ag: NiOx exhibit better crystallinity, higher coverage and smoother surface with densely packed larger grains than those grown on the pristine NiOx film. Consequently, the Ag: NiOx HTL boosts the efficiency of the inverted planar heterojunction PeSCs from 13.46% (for the pristine NiOx-based device) to 16.86% (for the 2 at.% Ag: NiOx-based device). Furthermore, the environmental stability of PeSCs based on Ag: NiOx HTL is dramatically improved compared to devices based on organic HTLs and pristine NiOx HTLs.

Here, we systematically studied the effect of the titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (TiAc2) ligand on the performance of PSCs with a planar n-i-p architecture. We prepared TiO2 nanocrystals from TiCl4 and ethyl alcohol with Cl ligands attached on its surface and we found that a tiny amount of TiAc2 treatment of as-prepared TiO2 nanocrystals in a mixed solution of chloroform and methyl alcohol can enhance PSC power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 14.7% to 18.3%. To investigate the effect of TiAc2 ligand on PSCs, TiO2 samples with different TiAc2 content were prepared by adding TiAc2 into the as-obtained TiO2 nanocrystal solution. We use x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to identify the content of Cl so as to reveal that Cl ligands can be substituted by TiAc2. We speculate that the improvement in PCE originates from amorphous TiO2 formation on the TiO2 nanocrystal surface, whereby a single-molecule layer of amorphous TiO2 facilitates charge transfer between the perovskite film and the TiO2 electronic transport layer, but excessive TiAc2 lowers the PSC performance dramatically.

Herein, we report an atmospheric pressure vapor assisted solution process (AP-VASP) for the growth of Cs doped MAPbI3 perovskite films that features highly uniform morphology, pin-hole free films, large grain size, as well as being scalable. The Cs(x)MA(1-x)PbI(3) films are formed by the reaction of Cs doped PbI2 films with MAI vapor in a simple oven.

At the same time, they are suitable for high-throughput manufacturing characterized by a low energy input and abundant low-cost materials. However, a further optimization of their efficiency, stability and reliability demands a more detailed optoelectronic characterization and understanding of losses including their evolution with time. In this work, we analyze perovskite solar cells with different architectures (planar, mesoporous, HTL-free), employing temperature dependent measurements (current-voltage, light intensity, electroluminescence) of the ideality factor to identify dominating recombination processes that limit the open-circuit voltage (V-oc). We find that in thoroughly-optimized, high-V-oc (approximate to 1.2 V) devices recombination prevails through defects in the perovskite. On the other hand, irreversible degradation at elevated temperature is caused by the introduction of broad tail states originating from an external source (e.g. metal electrode). Light-soaking is another effect decreasing performance, though reversibly. Based on FTPS measurements, this degradation is attributed to the generation of surface defects becoming a new source of non-radiative recombination. We conclude that improving long-term stability needs to focus on adjacent layers, whereas a further optimization of efficiency of top-performing devices requires understanding of the defect physics of the nanocrystalline perovskite absorber.

Their main characteristics include, direct band-gap (1.4 to 3.0 eV), large absorption coefficient in the visible spectrum, long carrier diffusion length and ambipolar charge transport. Aside that, perovskite thin films can be produced with low cost and are compatible with large-scale manufacture. Perovskite thin films have been synthesized mainly by spin-coating technique and thermal evaporation, which can be executed in one or two steps. Aiming to increase the light absorption, nanostructured perovskite thin films are also under intense study, since the nanostructures can absorb more light than a flat film. Thus, in this work, we reported the synthesis of perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) nanorods by means of conversion of lead sulphide quantum dots (PbSQD). The perovskite nanorods were grown by exposing the PbSQD to a highly concentrated iodine atmosphere and then dipping the resulting film in methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) solution. The first step converts completely the PbSQD into lead iodide (PbI2) nanowires, approximate to 50 mu m long and approximate to 200 nm diameter, through substitution of sulphur by iodine atoms and subsequent aggregation of the particles. The later step converts the PbI2 nanowires in perovskite nonorods (approximate to 5 mu m long and approximate to 400 nm diameter). The perovskite nanorods present a regular geometry along all its length. A preferential alignment of nanorods to the substrate plane was observed. The preliminary results show that we can control the size of nanorods through exposition time of PbSQD to iodine, which change the size of PbI2 nanowire as well. The conversion process was studied by x-ray diffraction, optical absorption, photoluminescence and scanning electron microscopy.",,,,"Marques, Francisco C/C-5257-2012; Filho, Jose Maria C Silva/J-8701-2018","Filho, Jose Maria C Silva/0000-0003-4110-0609",,,,,,,,,,,,2059-8521,,,,,,2018,3,32,,,,,1843,1848,,10.1557/adv.2018.188,,,,,,,,WOS:000434342700006,,,,,

In contrast, PL measurement of CIS film for Cu In = 0.66 taken at 20 K exhibited an asymmetric and broad PL spectrum with peaks at 0.845 eV and 0.787 eV.

Besides its good wettability and compatibility of the contact between metal electrode and organic layer, interestingly, Phen-I displays a dual functional property, i.e., it not only lowers the work function of the metallic cathode to increase electron extraction but also can be doped into electron transporting material to enhance the conductivity. The inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with Phen-I as cathode interlayer (CIL) show superior performance both in power conversion efficiency, with a maximum PCE of 18.13%, and devices stability as compared with the control devices.

In this Letter, the nonlinear absorption and fluorescence properties of FAPbBr(3) nanocrystal, one typical organometallic halide perovskite, have been investigated via Z-scan measurements and a density-dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectrum. The FAPbBr3 nanocrystal exhibits nonlinear absorption under the excitation of 800 nm, whose photon energy is below the bandgap of FAPbBr(3). The significant absorption is experimentally confirmed to be induced by two-photon absorption (TPA), and the TPA coefficient is measured to be similar to 0.0042 cm/GW. Moreover, the PL induced by TPA in FAPbBr(3) nanocrystal shows different temperature-dependent behaviors in the range of 90 to 350 K. The peaks of the PL spectrum remain nearly constant at 100-160 K, with a very shallow trough at around 150 K, while a linear blue shift (0.496 meV/K) of the spectrum is observed when temperature is above 160 K. These temperature-dependent fluorescence behaviors can be ascribed to the structural phase transition at about 150 K and the contribution of thermal expansion. Moreover, the exciton binding energy around 160 meV and the optical phonon energy of 15.3 meV are also extracted from the temperature-dependent PL data.

The experimental results showed that the fluorescence of STAPA-a and STAPA-b originated from the ICT state. In a weakly polar solvent toluene, the relaxation of the ICT state showed mono-exponential decay due to the absence of the influence of solvent polarity, which directly reflected the fluorescence lifetime. In polar solvents tetrahydrofuran and dichloromethane, accelerated evolutions of ICT states and multi-exponential processes were exhibited because of the interaction between solvent and solute. Furthermore, to explore the influence of the molecular structure on the dynamics of the ICT state, we compared the fluorescence relaxation processes in solvents with different viscosity. We found that the time-resolved properties of STAPA-b exhibit significant differences due to the introduction of alkyl chains. (C) 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

High absorption coefficient, long charge carrier diffusion length, low temperature processing and ambipolar behaviour are the main advantages of perovskite materials. The efficiency of the perovskite solar cell is considerably increased from 3.9-22.1% since 2009. In the present review, firstly, the fundamentals and progress in the field of PSC are discussed. The types and structures of PSC are also discussed. Three are four main layers (electron transport layer (ETL), photo-active layer (perovskite layer), the hole transport layer (HTL) and the back contact (the counter electrode)) present in PSC structure. Each and every layer has their importance and it plays an important role to make a low cost solar cell. So study is also focused on the ETL/HTL free PSC. Although the efficiency of PSC is increasing every year, the reproducibility, stability and large scale production are the main challenges. So, the use of mixed cations in active layer to enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of PSC are also discussed in detail. Pb-free PSCs are also discussed rigorously to make harmless PSC. The processing cost of metal electrode deposition in PSC is very costly. So, the replacement of the metal electrode by some other low cost counter electrode is discussed comprehensively in the present review.

However, the different solubility of PbI2 and CH3NH3I is problematic, initiating active solvent engineering research using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Here we investigated the pre-coordination of PbI2-DMSO powders for planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells fabricated by a low-temperature process (<= 100 degrees C). Pre-coordination was carried out by simple mechanical mixing using a mortar and pestle. The composition of PbI2-DMSOx (x = 0, 1, or 2) in the powder mixture was investigated by gradually increasing mechanical mixing time, and a dominant composition of PbI2-DMSO1 was obtained after a 10 min mixing process. The pre-coordinated PbI2-DMSO powders were then blended with CH3NH3I in DMF to make the CH3NH3PbI3 film by toluene-assisted spin-coating and heat treatment. Compared with the one-step blending of CH3NH3I, PbI2, and DMSO in DMF, the pre-coordination method resulted in better dissolution of PbI2, larger grain size, and pinhole-free morphology. Consequently, absorption, fluorescence, carrier lifetime, and charge extraction were enhanced. The average open-circuit voltage (1.046 V), short-circuit current (22.9 mA cm(-2)), fill factor (73.5%), and power conversion efficiency (17.6%) were increased by 2-12% with decreased standard deviations (13-50%), compared with the one-step blending method.

The prepared samples have been characterized by a variety of techniques such as I-V and EQE measurements, atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy. The mixing of QDs in the polymer blends improved the PCE - power conversion efficiency of the solar cells under standard light conditions. The improved PCE from 2.95 to 4.41% is mostly due to the increase in the fill factor (FF) and short-circuit current (J(sc)) of the devices with an optimum amount of CdS in the P3HT:PCBM blend. The increase in J(sc) possibly originated from the formation of a percolation network of CdS. The conjugation of QDs has increased the absorption of the active layers in the visible region. These results well matched as reported, conjugation of CdS in the perovskite active layer increased the absorption and PCE of the devices relative to those of the perovskite films.

The energy level, distribution shape, and density of highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and of lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) were computed for all three derivatives and compared in the neutral and oxidized forms. Results indicated that the different positions of OMe in the spiro-OMeTAD framework lead to different optical properties. It was also found that compared to the neutral form, in the oxidized forms, the maximum absorption band red shifts, new signals in the visible range between 500 and 850 nm appear, and the Stokes shift values reduce for all three derivatives. The exciton binding energy of spiro-OMeTAD with an o-OMe substituent is 0.52 eV, being smaller than that of p-OMe and m-OMe, indicating easier generation of free charge carriers. The hole mobility was calculated for all three molecules, and the obtained data revealed that the hole mobility of the o-OMe substituent has a value of 7.90 x 10(-3) cm(2) V-1 s(-1), which is respectively 3 and 11 times larger than that of p-OMe and m-OMe. The smaller exciton binding energy and larger hole mobility of the o-OMe substituent will result in a higher short-circuit current density (J(sc)) and a higher fill factor, respectively, demonstrating that po-spiro-OMeTAD is a promising candidate for use in perovskite solar cells.

Due to Br incorporation in the perovskite films, the band gap increased and the light absorption was slightly reduced while the charge carrier lifetime was prolonged due to the enhanced crystallinity. For the films with higher bromine content, the red shift of the photoluminescence peaks indicated that the phase segregation appeared in the films under illumination, which led to the formation of the iodine-rich domains in this process and the reduced carrier lifetime. On the contrary, for films with lower bromine content, the red shift of the photoluminescence peaks was negligible, which revealed that instability of the perovskite films under illumination can be suppressed by adjusting the bromine content of the films. Consequently, by moderate Br incorporation (CH3NH3Br/CH3NH3I mole ratio = 3:7), the CH3NH3PbBrXI3-X films with optimal photoelectric properties and photo-stability were achieved, and the stable photoelectric conversion efficiency of corresponding device under illumination can reach 13.8%.

We have carried out DFT based first principles calculations on Mn-doped and Ni-doped CsGeCl3 halide.

An additional peak is observed for both doped profiles in the visible light energy region. The study of the mechanical properties demonstrates that both the doped samples are mechanically stable and ductile as the pristine CsGeCl3. The study of the electronic properties shows that the excitation of photoelectrons is easier due to the formation of intermediate states in Mn-doped CsGeCl3.

By adding moderate amounts of methylammonium chloride (MACl) into MAPbI(3) perovskite precursor, we found the J-V hysteresis of carbon-based PSCs could be significantly alleviated and the crystallinity of MAPbI(3) perovskite could also be influenced. With the increasing amount of MACl, MAPbI(3) perovskite showed better and better crystallinity until the MACl came to 0.45 M. The champion device with 0.45 M of additional MACl exhibited a preferable PCE of 14.27% for reverse-scan (RS) and 14.50% for forward-scan (FS), significantly higher than that of the pristine device (8.74% for RS and 4.80% for FS). What's more, the J-V hysteretic index of the device gradually decreased along with the increasing amount of MACl, and kept at low value even when the crystallinity of MAPbI(3) perovskite became poor. Through XRD and PL analysis, we demonstrated that the recombination rate of the accumulated charges at the perovskite/TiO2 interface is the main reason for photocurrent hysteresis in carbon-based PSCs. High quality of perovskite crystals is an important contributing factor for high-performance PSCs with low hysteresis, but there is no necessary correlation between low hysteresis and good crystallinity.

Therefore, it is now time to focus on the critical step i.e. stability under the operating conditions for the development of a sustainable and durable PV technology based on PSCs. In order to improve the stability of PSCs, hole transport materials (HTMs) have been considered as the paramount components. This is due to the fact that most of the organic HTMs possess a hygroscopic and acidic nature that leads to poor stability of the PSCs.

However, perovskite active layers in solar cells are frequently prepared with unoptimized processes that lead to layers of inferior quality. This is often the case when research focuses on other aspects of the solar cell device, such as device design and architecture, carrier transport layers, electrodes, interlayers, etc. In this study, a single-step spin-coating method was used to prepare semi-crystalline PbI2(DMSO) complex films via evaporation-induced self-assembly. These optimized intermediate films were then used to form homogeneous methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)) perovskite films of optimum thickness (ca. 400 nm) with uniform surface coverage, good crystallinity, high purity, and grain sizes up to one micron, by employing a sequential deposition process involving intramolecular exchange between the PbI2(DMSO) complex film and a methylammonium iodide (MAI) layer deposited on top of it. We found that for certain ranges of MAI concentration, the formation of optimal-quality perovskite active layers was independent of MAI concentration, so long as MAI deposition occurred at specific corresponding spin speeds. Planar p-i-n perovskite solar cells comprising the optimized active layers were fabricated, and they exhibited negligible hysteresis and a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.72%, without any additional compositional and interfacial engineering. The latter can be used in the future to further enhance the PCE. These findings demonstrate the importance of an optimized perovskite active layer for reproducibly fabricating high-efficiency planar p-i-n photovoltaic devices.

To obtain cost-effective top cells, it is crucial to develop transparent conductive electrodes with low parasitic absorption and manufacturing cost. The commonly used indium tin oxide (ITO) shows some drawbacks, like the increasing prices and high-energy magnetron sputtering process. Transparent metal electrodes are promising candidates owing to the simple evaporation process, facile process conditions, and high conductivity, and the cheaper silver (Ag) electrode with lower parasitic absorption than gold may be the better choice.

The sensitivity of the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal and its derivatives to chemical composition, film-forming process, and even moisture lead to difficulties in evaluating its electronic structure and redox behavior using electrochemical techniques. Nevertheless, full understanding of the electrochemical behavior of the perovskite crystal is certainly beneficial for tuning its redox properties and chemical stability, especially for device fabrication. We show that the band structure of CH3NH3PbI3 can be successfully evaluated based on electrochemical square wave voltammetry. The energy level of the bottom of the conduction band of the perovskite crystal was determined directly from the onset reduction potential with reference to the onset oxidation potential of ferrocene, and estimated to be -3.56 eV; the top of the valence band, at-5.07 eV, was determined indirectly after taking into consideration the bandgap, because the oxidation current of the iodide ions shields that corresponding to the valence band of the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal. The overlap of the oxidation currents from the iodide ions and the valence band of the crystal suggests that there are excess iodide ions in CH3NH3PbI3 not involved in the development of the valence band. In addition, the alternating current (AC) impedance spectra of CH3NH3PbI3 indicate that the iodide ions are not completely immobilized. These imply that the defects in the crystal are related to the iodide ions to a large extent. The electrochemistry of CH3NH3PbI3 in an organic electrolyte reveals its coupling degradation during the redox processes in square wave and cyclic voltammetry. The degradation reactions result from the reduction of lead ions and oxidation of iodide ions in the perovskite crystal. In electrochemical reduction, along with the reduction that occurs in the conduction band, the lead ions in the crystal are reduced to metallic lead, which introduces a phase change in the crystal, as revealed in cyclic voltammetry; the metallic lead can be re-oxidized electrochemically. In the case of electrochemical oxidation, the iodide ions, as well as the valence band of CH3NH3PbI3, lose electrons. The electrochemically generated iodine diffuses into the organic electrolyte gradually, which results in the loss of iodide ions in the crystal. Such loss of iodide ions continues during the cyclic redox reaction. Apparently, the electrochemical investigations on perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 show that the crystal is extremely reactive during the redox process; attention should be paid on controlling the excess iodide ions and the irreversible phase change resulting from the oxidation of lead ions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1000-6818,,,,,,2018,34,11,,,,,1197,1201,,10.3866/PKU.WHXB201804097,,,,,,,,WOS:000431610500005,,,,,

In p-i-n type Pero-SCs, one of the most commonly used hole transport layer (HTL) materials is poly(3,4-ethylene- dioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), which possesses a high coverage and an extremely smooth surface. However, the inferior electrical conductivity (or large series resistance) and lower work function (WF) of PEDOT:PSS relative to many other HTL materials limits the open-circuit voltages of Pero-SCs. Furthermore, the hygroscopic property and the acidic nature of PEDOT:PSS can readily cause the degradation of perovskite, and thereby affect the long-term stability of Pero-SCs. The abovementioned disadvantages can hinder the application of PEDOT:PSS in high-performance and stable Pero-SCs; therefore, many efforts have been made to modify PEDOT:PSS to prevent these disadvantages, for instance, adding various organic solvents, surfactants, salts, or acids to PEDOT:PSS as dopants. In this paper, we report a simple codoping method to modify PEDOT:PSS, i.e., employing L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as codopants in PEDOT:PSS, and applying it as a HTL in p-i-n type Pero-SCs. Herein, DOPA and DMSO were mixed separately with PEDOT:PSS to obtain HTLs for comparison. The DMSO-doped PEDOT:PSS improved the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS film, while the DOPA-doped PEDOT:PSS tuned the WF of the PEDOT:PSS film. Hence, codoping of DMSO and DOPA not only allows for a good match of the energy levels between PEDOT:PSS and the perovskite but also leads to an improvement in the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS. The champion PCE of the Pero-SCs increased from 13.35% to 17.54% after DOPA and DMSO were codoped in PEDOT:PSS. Owing to their aligned energy levels and enhanced charge transportation, the detailed photovoltaic parameters were greatly improved. Scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffraction were used to characterize the morphological change and crystallinity of the perovskite films. Morphological characterization also revealed that the density of grain boundaries in the perovskite films decreased, which should alleviate the charge recombination occurring in the photoactive layer. Both steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL characterizations were carried out, and they indicated that nonradiative recombination increased for the perovskite films prepared on the doped PEDOT:PSS films. This result explains the improved short-circuit current density. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was employed to determine the resistances of the solar cells. The results are consistent with device performance and that reflected in the PL spectra.",,,,"Song, Bo/A-9464-2015","Song, Bo/0000-0002-7546-9482; Huang, Peng/0000-0002-5150-8213",,,,,,,,,,,,1000-6818,,,,,,2018,34,11,,,,,1264,1271,,10.3866/PKU.WHXB201804096,,,,,,,,WOS:000431610500011,,,,,

Therefore, it is imperative to find environmentally-friendly metals to replace lead. Although tin (Sn) halide perovskites can be regarded as a valid alternative to lead perovskites, their poor stability and lower conversion efficiency hinder the substitution of Sn for Pb. In this work, highly uniform and pinhole-free perovskite films were prepared by the introduction of a small amount of lead thiocyanate in precursor solutions.

The reversible behavior and the long dynamics during the write/erase processes indicate that the physical mechanism behind the switching is related to polarization effects. A detailed analysis of the charge carrier trapping/detrapping, transport, and recombination mechanisms has been performed by taking the ion migration and the consequent charge carrier accumulation within the device into account. The charge transport during the write operation can be described by space-charge-limited conduction process.

Planar perovskite photovoltaics feature an active layer that can provide a large exciton diffusion length, reaching several micrometers, but require efficient carrier transport layers for charge extraction. In this study, we employed two nanocomposite carrier transfer layersan electron transport layer (ETL) comprising [6,6]phenyl-C-61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) doped with the small molecule 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (Bphen), to enhance the electron mobility, and a hole transfer layer (HTL) comprising poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) doped with molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets, to enhance the hole mobility. We used ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy to determine the energy levels of these composite ETLs and HTLs; atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy to probe their surface structures; and transmission electron microscopy and synchrotron grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering to decipher the structures of the ETLs. Adding a small amount (less than 1%) of Bphen allowed us to tune the energy levels of the ETL and decrease the size of the PC61BM clusters and, therefore, generate more PC61BM aggregation domains to provide more pathways for electron transport, leading to enhanced PCEs of the resulting perovskite devices. We used quantitative pump-probe data to resolve the carrier dynamics from the perovskite to the ETL and HTL, and observed a smaller possibility of carrier recombination and a shorter injection lifetime in the perovskite solar cell doubly modified with carrier transport layers, resulting in an enhancement of the PCE. The PCE reached 16% for a planar inverted perovskite device featuring an ETL incorporating 0.5 wt% Bphen within PC61BM and 0.1 wt% MoS2 within PEDOT:PSS; this PCE is more than 50% higher than the value of 10.2% for the corresponding control device.",,,,,"Wei, Kung-Hwa/0000-0002-0248-4091",,,,,,,,,,,,2046-2069,,,,,,2018,8,23,,,,,12526,12534,,10.1039/c8ra01532e,,,,,,,,WOS:000429450000004,,,,,

However, due to the decrease of the layer thickness, thin perovskite devices with weak light-harvesting have poor performance. Moreover, the performance of plasmonic thin perovskite devices by incorporating noncoupling metal NPs cannot give comparable performance with normal devices. In this perspective, we discuss the implication of employing random silver-gold heterodimers in MAPbI3 solar cells with the aim of establishing some guidelines for the efficient ultrathin perovskite solar cells. This method induces an extraordinarily high light-harvesting for ultrathin perovskite film. And the underlying physical mechanism behind the enhanced absorption is deeply investigated by plasmon hybridization, dipolar-dipolar coupling method and FDTD simulation. We notice that perovskite embedded silver-gold heterodimer overcomes the vanished antibonding plasmon resononse (sigma*) in nonjunction area of gold/silver homodimer. A 150-nm perovskite film with embedded random silver-gold heterodimers with 80 nm size and 25 nm gap distance processes 28.15% absorption enhancement compared to the reference film, which is higher than the reported 10% for gold homodimers.

The introduction of photonic crystals can greatly optimize the propagation and distribution of light in solar cells. Photonic crystals can improve the performance of solar cells from five aspects: (1) Photonic crystals constructed as back mirrors to reduce light loss and increase absorption efficiency of solar cell. (2) The interaction between photons and sensitizers can be enhanced by the ""slow photon effect"" of the photonic crystal band gap, which enhances the excitation efficiency. (3) Photonic crystal can be used as a scattering layer, increasing the propagation path of light in the material, forming a resonance enhancement mode in the absorption layer, and improving the light absorption efficiency. (4) Photonic crystals have large specific surface area. Especially three-dimensional photonic crystals can provide excellent carrier for sensitizer, which can effectively increase the load and activity of sensitized molecules and improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency (5) Photonic crystals can be used to reduce the dependence of solar cells on the incident angle of sunlight. For example, when the incident light is tilted, the blue shift of the Bragg position results in more overlap with the dye absorption peak, generating a higher efficiency that partially compensates the reduced photon flux due to light inclination. However, photonic crystals in different locations of the solar cell will improve or inhibit photoelectric conversion efficiency. Therefore, the fully understanding of light manipulation of photonic crystals and their correctly application is the key to improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency.

Certified efficiencies of inverted structure (p-i-n) devices have now exceeded 20%. In these p-i-n devices, fullerene compounds are the most popular electron-transfer materials. However, the full function of fullerenes in perovskite solar cells is still under investigation, and the mechanism of photocurrent hysteresis suppression by fullerene remains unclear. In previous reports, thick fullerene layers (>20 nm) were necessary to fully cover the perovskite film surface to make good contact with perovskite film and avoid large leakage currents. In addition, the solution-processed fullerene layer has been broadly thought to infiltrate into the perovskite film to passivate traps on grain boundary surfaces, causing suppressed photocurrent hysteresis. In this work, we demonstrate an efficient perovskite photovoltaic device with only 1 nm C-60 deposited by vapor deposition as the electron-selective material. Utilizing a combination of fluorescence microscopy and impedance spectroscopy, we that the ultrathin C60 predominately acts to extract electrons from the perovskite film while concomitantly suppressing the photocurrent hysteresis by reducing space charge accumulation at the interface.

The influence of GBL SVPA on the microstructure of perovskite layers and performance of PSCs was studied. The short circuit current density (J(sc)) of the devices significantly increased, yielding a high efficiency of 16.58%, which was 27.05% higher than that of thermally annealed films. A model was derived to explain the effect of GBL SVPA on PSCs. The perovskite films prepared by this method present several advantages such as complete transformation of PbI2 to CH3NH3PbI3, high crystallinity, large grain size, and fewer grain boundaries than those prepared without GBL SVPA.

Here, CA ETL demonstrates a 50 meV upshift in Fermi level position with respect to CC ETL, contributing to higher n-type conductivity and lower electron injection barrier at the interface. Furthermore, CA ETL also exhibits profound influence on the perovskite microstructure leading to larger grain size and uniform distribution. Cesium acetate incorporated devices exhibit about 82% higher PCE compared to conventional CC devices. In addition to higher photovoltaic performance, CA devices exhibit mitigated photo-current hysteresis phenomena compared to CC devices, owing to suppressed electrode polarization phenomena. Besides, the stability of the CA devices are 400% higher than the conventional CC devices, retaining almost 90% of its initial PCE even after a month-long (30 days) systematic degradation study. The mechanism behind superior performance and stability is investigated and discussed comprehensively.",,,,"Goncales, Vinicius/F-1650-2013","Goncales, Vinicius/0000-0003-1288-1987; Gooding, John Justin/0000-0002-5398-0597",,,,,,,,,,,,0927-0248,1879-3398,,,,JAN,2018,174,,,,,,172,186,,10.1016/j.solmat.2017.08.032,,,,,,,,WOS:000415392500021,,,,,

Understanding cost barriers and drivers that will impact its future. commercial viability can beneficially guide research directions. Because processes, materials and equipment for manufacturing are still under development, it is difficult to estimate these costs accurately. We use a cost method developed to allow for uncertainty in the input assumptions to analyse three demonstrated R2R compatible manufacturing sequences and two potential optimised sequences. Using these novel methods, we have identified and quantified key cost barriers; high cost materials P3HT and PCBM, the use of evaporation for the rear metal deposition, and the transparent ITO coating. We project that technology developments in these key areas would halve the expected manufacturing cost to US$37/m +/- 30%. With 68% GFF, 10% PCE and a 3 year lifetime, such R2R perovskite modules would be competitive with existing flexible PV products in the market on a $/W and power to weight basis. To compete with Si and CdTe in the flat plate PV market, PCE and lifetimes in excess of 15% and 15 years respectively would be required.",,,,"green, martin a/H-7567-2012; Vak, Doojin/B-3894-2008; Gao, Mei/A-9223-2011; Ho-Baillie, Anita/R-4801-2018","green, martin a/0000-0002-8860-396X; Vak, Doojin/0000-0001-7704-5563; Ho-Baillie, Anita/0000-0001-9849-4755; Egan, Renate/0000-0002-8970-4703",,,,,,,,,,,,0927-0248,1879-3398,,,,JAN,2018,174,,,,,,314,324,,10.1016/j.solmat.2017.08.038,,,,,,,,WOS:000415392500038,,,,,

This has led to a rapid growth in revenue and a corresponding drop in margins that has suppliers implementing solutions to further reduce the costs associated with manufacturing solar panels. Despite these improvements, solar energy derived from photovoltaics still has an energy pay-back time of at least one year with some of this is associated with heating processes. To further reduce costs, a new technology called intense pulsed light is being implemented to eliminate expensive high energy thermal processes and encourage higher throughput. The technology also includes opportunities for devices that contain thermally limited materials. The technique was originally explored when the photovoltaic industry was quite small, and has only recently begun to gather interest as the printed electronics industry realized gains. This review discusses the use of intense pulsed light in photovoltaic manufacturing, detailing the process from a photonic physics perspective, the relevant heat transfer mechanisms, as well as its impact on the major photovoltaic sectors. Demonstrations of generation 1: crystalline silicon solar cells, generation 2: thin film solar cells, and emerging technologies: hybrid organic solar cell applications are discussed. Lastly, future outlooks for intense pulsed light in the photovoltaic manufacturing sector are offered.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0927-0248,1879-3398,,,,JAN,2018,174,,,,,,359,369,,10.1016/j.solmat.2017.09.010,,,,,,,,WOS:000415392500043,,,,,

Films aged under solar intensities started to degrade above 75 degrees C, while films in the dark degraded at 95 degrees C. To investigate the temperature-induced degradation mechanism, spectroscopic techniques such as Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectroscopy, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS), and Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) were used. Results show that the films aged under light at 75 degrees C degraded to a mixture of PbI2 and metallic Pb. In contrast, films aged thermally in the dark, or with light and oxygen, degraded to PbI2 only. MAPbI(3) solar cells were aged to show the effect of the metallic lead on the charge transfer mechanism.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0927-0248,1879-3398,,,,JAN,2018,174,,,,,,566,571,,10.1016/j.solmat.2017.09.053,,,,,,,,WOS:000415392500068,,,,,
